  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder screamed in anger, "Lennox, you damn fool! How dare you hit me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get over here and beat him senseless! Today, I'll break this guy's legs first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several men rushed forward, pinning Lennox's arms and restraining him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lennox struggled furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastards! How dare you desecrate the dead? You'll all go to hell, and God will punish you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop talking nonsense! Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone punched Lennox hard twice, silencing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to the Vance family's acquisition of West Cemetery, the cemetery now officially belonged to them, and Lennox was no longer its caretaker. His fate no longer mattered to anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men tied Lennox to a nearby tree and stuffed a filthy sock into his mouth, leaving him fuming and growling angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder, clutching his burning cheek, quickly turned to Axel and Asher, bowing apologetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Axel Vance, Mr. Asher Vance, I'm terribly sorry for the interruption. I'll teach this old fool a lesson later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For now, shall we begin digging up the grave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder pointed toward the tombstone, his eyes glinting with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a petty man who still harbored a grudge from the time Alexander had beaten him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher waved his hand to stop him. "Not yet! Let's wait a little longer. I want to dig up this grave right in front of Alexander and watch him bow and beg me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel nodded in agreement. "Exactly. There's no rush. Alexander dared to challenge the Vance family's authority. He must be made to submit completely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder eagerly nodded along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right, right! Let's dig up this grave in front of him and feed his mother's remains to the dogs. Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, none of them realized what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From a distance, a dozen snipers from the Ultimate Alliance had already taken aim with their rifles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had given them a strict order that anyone who dared touch the grave would be eliminated immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Ava arrived at the cemetery entrance, carrying Ashley. She was accompanied by Lily, Ann, and about a dozen other relatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava scanned the rows of black cars parked in the lot, smirking coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Vance family had brought a lot of people, but this was Loscity. No matter how many they brought, it wouldn't compare to the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where's Alex? Why isn't he here yet... Did something happen to him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without seeing Alexander, Lily asked anxiously, glancing around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ann frowned as well. She asked, "Why hasn't Alex arrived yet? Should we call the police?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Daddy, I want Daddy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ashley muttered, tugging on Ava's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite the chaos, Ava remained calm. She knew what Alexander was doing but didn't reveal it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She reassured them calmly, saying, "Don't worry, everyone. Let's wait at the grave. Alex will be here soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The group, though concerned, made their way toward the graveyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't long before Ryder spotted them, his face lighting up with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're here! Alexander's people have arrived!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher and his group immediately turned, glaring viciously at Ava and her group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What happened to you, Lennox?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's expression darkened when she saw Lennox tied to a tree, beaten black and blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lily was also very anxious. She had a good impression of him, so she hurried over to help him untie the rope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You old fool! You can't even protect yourself, and you still dare to help Lennox?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder roared, storming over and shoving Lily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop! How dare you hit her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava shouted angrily. If she hadn't been holding Ashley, she would have slapped Ryder herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ann and the others quickly surrounded Ryder, the scene devolving into chaos as they argued and pushed each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A bunch of trash dares to act up in front of me? Arrest them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher gave an order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Asher's command, dozens of bodyguards surged forward, surrounding Ava and her group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ashley, terrified, burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Daddy, I want Daddy... Daddy, please come save us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No one can bully us! Alexander will kill all of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava was furious, her chest heaving with anger as her gaze burned with indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher laughed arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "So, you're Ava? Not bad. You are beautiful and have a great figure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He leered at Ava, his gaze lingering on her chest with obvious greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That coward Alexander dared to compete with me for a woman? Today, not only will I dig up this grave in front of everyone, but I'll also make you lick my shoes in public!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander is just a spineless coward, isn't he? Too scared to come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Vance family members burst into raucous laughter.</span></p><div class="pagination">
