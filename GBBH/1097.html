  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Knock, knock... knock, knock, knock..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A light knock echoed through the hallway. Without even glancing at the door, Alexander knew it was Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The girl had a boldness to her, and at this late hour, it was clear what she was after&mdash;a night of pleasure with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's young, but she's got guts," Alexander mused with a wry smile, yet he made no move to open the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine knocked a few more times, but when there was no answer, a look of frustration crossed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After standing in silence for a moment, she left, her mood visibly soured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Alexander was settling into bed, nearly drifting off to sleep, the sound of footsteps echoed again from outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, it wasn't Maxine. It was Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a brief pause, Alexander decided to open the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could even process what was happening, Emma flung herself into his arms, wrapping her arms around his neck and pressing her lips to his in a deep kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He caught her with ease, lifting her off the ground and pulling her against him. His right arm slipped beneath her waist, lifting her higher, their bodies pressed together as she clung to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mm..." They kissed for a long while, the heat between them intensifying. Alexander lowered his head and buried his face in the soft, plush curves of her chest, kissing and nibbling, savoring every inch of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, I know what I'm doing," Emma whispered between breaths, her voice full of passion. "This isn't a momentary impulse. Being with you... it's the happiest I've ever been."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gazed into his eyes with a tenderness that seemed almost too fragile. "Don't worry. Once you leave Newbrook, I'll return to my family. I won't look for you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sighed inwardly. Perhaps this was for the best&mdash;he never intended to break up a family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma, wearing nothing but a thin robe, pressed herself against him, her body warm and full.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her generous bust felt heavy in his hands as he supported her, his touch gentle yet possessive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma's breath quickened as his hands roamed over her, caressing every curve, igniting a fire within her. Unable to resist any longer, she pushed him back onto the bed, straddling him and taking control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She moved fiercely, a confident, almost reckless rhythm, giving herself and him immense pleasure, each motion sending waves of ecstasy through them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next morning, after a quick breakfast, Alexander headed to a prominent law firm in Newbrook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd hired a well-known lawyer, and together they prepared two legal documents, which he handed over to the attorney before heading to Silver Shield Security with Alvin and his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they arrived at the company's headquarters, the security guards were stunned to see Alvin walk confidently toward the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hadn't he been arrested?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why was he here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, an old man with white hair stormed out from inside, shouting angrily at Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alvin! I've been looking for you. Our chairman, Thomas, was murdered, and his son, Jordan, is now a fool. Are you behind this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! Silas, I don't know what you're talking about. But I do know one thing&mdash;Silver Shield Security no longer belongs to the Nicholson family. It now belongs to Mr. Hawthorne. You're about to lose your job as vice president."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's bullshit! Who the hell is Mr. Hawthorne?" Silas barked, furious. "You're here to cause trouble, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Silas Nicholson, the younger brother of Thomas, and vice president of Silver Shield Security, wasn't about to give up without a fight. He gestured sharply to the guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get them! Beat them up. If anything happens, I'll take responsibility."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, however, just smiled, watching them with an almost amused expression. The look on their faces was nothing short of absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'd like to see you try," he said coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The lawyer, with a commanding presence, stepped forward, his voice booming with authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did you not know? Mr. Hawthorne now owns 90% of Silver Shield Security's shares. The board is no longer controlled by the Nicholson family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible!" Silas sneered, not a hint of belief in his eyes. "You're lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with Thomas and Jordan gone, the company's shares haven't disappeared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The lawyer handed Silas a business card with a chilling smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You should have heard of me. My name is Atlas. I represent Mr. Hawthorne now, and I've been tasked with taking over Silver Shield Security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then pulled out a signed share transfer agreement, presenting it to Silas. "Here. These are the original signatures of Thomas and Jordan. We've had them verified. So, now... Silver Shield Security's largest shareholder is Mr. Hawthorne, and as for your family..." Atlas gave Silas a pitying look. "Well, you're out."</span></p><div class="pagination">
