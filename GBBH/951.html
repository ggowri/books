  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young woman had a stunning appearance and a tall, seductive figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her white training outfit fluttered in the breeze as she moved, each gesture radiating a quiet elegance and martial grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her punches were fast and precise, and her body seemed to flow like water, each movement a fluid expression of power and agility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the morning breeze swept through, her outfit clung to her body, revealing her curves in a way that was impossible to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't staring at her for the reasons most would. His attention was fixed on the strange energy flowing within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was internal energy, a fundamental force in martial arts, like the Force in some ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was about tapping into one's hidden potential, achieving harmony with nature, and accessing incredible power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After studying her for a moment, Alexander shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The flow of her internal energy is a bit chaotic. But she could easily handle a few regular opponents," he muttered to himself, but the young woman heard it clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze snapped to him, eyes flashing with irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you just say?" she demanded, stepping into his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can talk down to me? How about we have a little sparring match, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled lightly, his tone calm and unruffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, that was a mistake on my part."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his casual tone only seemed to make her angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!" Her face flushed with anger, her voice rising. "How dare you mock me like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was used to respect, always treated with deference. Never had someone dared to be so rude to her, especially not in front of her grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lunged to grab his wrist, trying to catch him off guard with a quick move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace, stop!" The old man, who had been watching quietly, spoke up firmly, stopping her in her tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, didn't you see him disrespect me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quiet!" he snapped, his voice leaving no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a huff, the young woman relented. Her grandfather was the only one who could reign her in like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot Alexander one last glare, then moved back to stand beside her grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at the old man, a faint smile tugging at his lips. There was something vaguely familiar about him, like he'd seen him somewhere before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man, who was calm despite the tension, finally spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Gavin Lawson, and this is my granddaughter, Grace. We've come to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> specifically to find you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's demeanor shifted at once, his face becoming serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin was a powerful figure, second in command in the </span><span>Avalora's</span><span> government.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace couldn't help but roll her eyes. "Grandpa, why don't we just grab him and interrogate him? Why bother with the pleasantries?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin gave her a sharp look, clearly not pleased with her suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look carefully at Mr. Hawthorne. Do you notice anything... unusual about him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace squinted at Alexander, her eyes narrowing with skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What could be so special about him? He's just some guy who's rude and doesn't know his place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave him a once-over, and though he wasn't bad-looking, there didn't seem to be anything extraordinary about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin sighed in exasperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all your years of training, you still don't see it? His breathing. Look at the way he breathes. It's completely different from ours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His breathing?" Grace blinked, surprised by the observation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne's breath is steady, controlled, much slower than ours. This means his martial arts are at an incredibly advanced level. Far more advanced than yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe it... In my lifetime, I never expected to meet someone as skilled as Mr. Hawthorne. No wonder he's able to handle top-tier fighters without breaking a sweat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin's tone was filled with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, now noticing the way Alexander's chest barely moved as he breathed, realized her grandfather was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His physical conditioning was off the charts, far beyond hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could he really be stronger than me?" she thought, both amazed and a little frustrated by the realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, remained silent. The truth was, calling him a martial artist was an understatement. He was a Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what brings you to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> to find me?" Alexander asked, cutting straight to the heart of the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, seeing his indifference, couldn't hold back her frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really are something else. Aren't you going to apologize to my grandfather for your rudeness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just smiled coldly, showing no intention of backing down.</span></p><div class="pagination">
