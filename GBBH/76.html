  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Theodore faced the grim reality of his new disability, despair washed over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you dare to use magic against me! I swear I will kill you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, news of the Brilliant Group's Theodore being rendered helpless by sorcery spread like wildfire throughout the city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the office of the Saint Group, Rebecca voiced her concerns loudly, "Ava, Alexander is getting way too bold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You need to rein him in!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To her surprise, Ava simply smiled, seemingly unfazed by the chaos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca said, her voice tinged with urgency, "Are you even listening to me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What Alexander did is going to bring trouble to the Saint Group!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava shook her head dismissively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Theodore was already targeting the Saint Group. Alexander just gave them a taste of their own medicine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca's expression remained one of worry. "Ava, he's into magic. What if one day you two have a falling out, and he decides to curse you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With unwavering confidence, Ava replied, "He's not a bad person; he would never do that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca sighed deeply, thinking to herself, "Ava is completely smitten by Alexander. I need to protect her from falling into a trap."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Theodore is Sebastian's son. The Brilliant Group isn't going to let this slide. How do you plan to explain this to Sebastian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the mention of Sebastian, a fierce glint flashed in Ava's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Explain? What do I need to explain to them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even the top experts say this incident probably has nothing to do with Alexander. Otherwise, it's just too far-fetched."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Ava so fiercely defend Alexander left Rebecca at a loss for words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Alexander strolled into the room with a grin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca immediately confronted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've caused Ava a world of trouble. Shouldn't you be packing your bags and leaving Loscity?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander shook his head. "This is all Theodore's doing. It's just the beginning, and I won't let them off the hook."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca was taken aback. "Do you even realize what you're saying? The Brilliant Group has assets in hundreds of billions! They can mobilize resources and manpower that you can't possibly handle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Unless... you're trying to drag Ava and the Saint Group into this mess. I see your true colors now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander raised an eyebrow, finding Rebecca's perspective short-sighted, akin to the former secretary who had been dismissed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Hansen, my girlfriend hasn't said a word, so why are you so eager to take charge? Seems like you're trying to steal the spotlight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava, don't you think you should manage your boyfriend a bit better?" Rebecca huffed, gripping Ava's arm and shaking her indignantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava chuckled softly, trying to defuse the tension. "Rebecca, why don't you head home? I'll call you when I have a moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, once you have a man, your best friend doesn't matter anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Ava could protest, Rebecca slammed the door behind her, leaving Ava shaking her head with an amused smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She comes from a well-off family and has been spoiled since childhood. She's a bit headstrong, but her heart is in the right place. Don't hold it against her," Ava said, still smiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander waved his hand dismissively. "I'm not bothered. So, what's the deal? Why did you call me here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava sobered up immediately. "The 'magic powder' is an absolute sensation, sweeping the market and crushing all of Brilliant Group's products in Loscity. If it were to be promoted nationwide or even globally, the very foundation of Brilliant Group would crumble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She paused, her eyes fixed on Alexander for any sign of his reaction. "But the powder is being sold exclusively by Billy. Do you have any idea who's supplying him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander maintained his calm demeanor, his voice steady and collected. "It's a blessing in disguise. Whoever's behind the magic powder, it certainly works in our favor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava, noticing his nonchalant response, felt a flicker of disappointment. She thought, "Could it be that Alexander isn't orchestrating the powder's rise to fame behind the scenes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had already discerned her probing, but he wasn't ready to reveal the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava cautioned quietly, her tone soft but earnest, "You need to tread carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sebastian's vindictive nature means he'll seek revenge for his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, remind Billy that Brilliant Group would undoubtedly try to take over the magic powder. He could cooperate with us, with the Saint Group, in selling it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've saved Billy's life; he even considered you his boss. It's up to you to make this happen."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander puffed out his chest, his confidence radiating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, I'll handle it. I'm sure Billy will be on board."</p><div class="pagination">
