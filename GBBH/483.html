  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava tightly wrapped her arms around Alexander's neck, kissing him gently on the face, as if saying goodbye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt an inexplicable sadness wash over him. He asked, "Ava, is there something on your mind? Don't hide it from me. I promise I'll help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, really, there's nothing!" Ava quickly denied, wiping away a tear with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! Come on, let's go buy a birthday cake for my mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She linked her arm with Alexander's and laughed as they headed outside, trying to act carefree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander sensed something was off about Ava, though he couldn't quite put his finger on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they approached the shopping district, they had just exited the parking lot when Leonard stepped out, blocking their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, what a pleasure! I didn't expect the president of the Saint Group to visit our </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> incognito!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grinned at Ava while barely glancing at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava frowned, "Mr. Moon, have you been spying on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not spying, just keeping tabs, mainly concerning that bracelet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he shot a sharp glare at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Mr. Hawthorne must be the one you're financially supporting. He took it upon himself to spend one hundred million on that bracelet without your consent, I assume?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Alexander couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's expression turned serious. "Mr. Moon, you've got it all wrong. Alexander is not a man I keep; </span><span>he's</span><span> my boyfriend. He can buy whatever he wants without needing my </span><span>permission. I should clarify that the bracelet means a lot to him, so it's not up for grabs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was quick to understand Leonard's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Known for his reputation in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, Leonard was said to have accurate divination skills, which made Ava a bit uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had bought the bracelet with his own money, and Ava wouldn't agree to anything Leonard suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard, however, didn't seem upset. Instead, he smiled knowingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, I did come to discuss that bracelet, but I also have urgent news. You're in extreme danger right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? What danger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's brows furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you offend someone? You've been hit with a serious curse. If you don't act quickly to dispel it, you could be in grave danger within three days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard spoke gravely, extending his hand towards Ava's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava froze, uncertain if Leonard was telling the truth or spinning a tale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander noticed a faint silver glow emanating from Leonard's palm. Using his All-seeing Eyes, he saw it was a silver tarot card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within that silver light, a hint of dark energy flickered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alexander was no expert in sorcery or divination, his mastery of the Force and All-seeing Eyes allowed him to see that Leonard was up to no good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Alexander shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard flinched but didn't cease his approach, instead pressing on toward Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tarot card in his hand transformed from silver to black, revealing the Death card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grim skeleton knight sat astride a warhorse, brandishing a scythe and a battle flag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Death card touched Ava, the dark energy would surely surge into her, threatening to control her and pressuring Alexander to hand over the bracelet&mdash;or worse, extort a fortune from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift step, Alexander positioned himself in front of Ava, his palm meeting Leonard's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, if you want to die, then let's get to it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard sneered, and the dark energy from the Death card erupted forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This energy was the culmination of his secret curse techniques, and upon touching an ordinary person, it could mean death or worse&mdash;servitude to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard's reputation in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> was built not only on his proficiency in divination but also on the control he wielded over those he cursed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
