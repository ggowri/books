He hugged Alyssa and Beverly on his left and right and strode towards the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three women knelt obediently on the bed, allowing Alexander to choose them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spent the whole evening with the three women and had a great time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, they had no more strength left and fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was full of energy.

And Alyssa was loyal to him for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia might want revenge on the Axe next. Alexander was prepared for that, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he occupied Treasure Island, he would dispatch some people to </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town, so that </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town's defense would be stable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long flight, Alexander and Alice finally returned to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander's authorized agent, Xavier temporarily stayed in </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're finally back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava saw Alexander and threw herself into his arms at </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Hey, you smell so good. Did you just take a shower. Can't you wait?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and sniffed behind her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop that. I don't take a bath for that..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava blushed in embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took her hand and got into the car.

Ava moaned as she grabbed his genitals and rubbed it skillfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander directly carried her to his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "What a little slut! You came to pick me up without wearing any underwear. And you prepared a car like this. You can't wait, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander teased. Ava blushed and lay on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the moving commercial vehicle began to shake violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver was stunned, and then, deliberately slowed down the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver took more than an hour to drive what was supposed to be a half-hour journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava got out of the car, leaning weakly on Alexander.
