  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please," Charlize stammered, "Can we... can we take a break... just for a bit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a dampness between her thighs and was terrified that someone else might notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Alexander was pressed against her, shielding her from the view of the others. But in front of Alexander, she had no secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What made Charlize even more embarrassed was that her body's response had intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize wasn't a prude. She could even be considered quite liberal. But she was, after all, a woman. The thought of reaching a climax in front of so many people was mortifying. Her cheeks flushed a deep crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned in, whispering with a teasing grin, "Doesn't it feel amazing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize, both flustered and annoyed, pinched Alexander's waist with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you're doing this on purpose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a loud crash echoed as the door was kicked open, slamming against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there! Are you seeking death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too arrogant. We can't let him escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team members' anger flared as they swarmed the intruder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, a dozen team members lay on the ground&mdash;some with bruised faces, some bloodied, and others motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intruder was none other than Bruno!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode in with a cold expression, limping and wielding a knife, his eyes brimming with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno had waited outside the Saint Group for a long time, but when Alexander didn't show, he couldn't resist storming into the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was supremely confident in his abilities, dismissing the Ultimate Alliance as no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes narrowed as he surveyed Bruno, his gaze lingering on the machete, a mocking smile playing on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had used his All-seeing Eyes to see through the sheath to the blood-red machete that had been forged and repaired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno couldn't help but feel a chill, realizing once again that he was completely exposed to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having honed his knife skills in the jungle for over twenty years, Bruno possessed the instincts of a wild beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The extra second Alexander's gaze lingered on his blade was enough to unsettle him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been practicing blades in the jungle for over twenty years, and he had the instincts of a beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, Alexander's gaze only stayed at his blade for a second, which immediately made Bruno shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno exhaled deeply, touching his treasured blade to rally his waning confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Alexander with a murderous glare, shouting, "You must die today. I will save those women you've deceived!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize couldn't hold back a laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was at a loss, thinking Bruno had truly lost his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When had he ever deceived women? Their relationships were consensual. What business was it of this cripple's?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so naive. You think you can kill me with a reforged blade? Dream on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed, his tone dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno sneered, "So you're scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know how Alexander had figured it out, but with his blade in hand, he was still brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, let me deal with this madman!" Charlize volunteered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno's anger flared at the suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lady, don't you know Alexander has many women? He's a </span><span>heart-breaker</span><span>. Why are you still fighting for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize burst into laughter as if she had heard the funniest joke in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied helplessly, "You really have lost it! Have you considered that we're all here willingly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno stood stunned, shaking his head with utmost seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! They can't be willing. You're deceiving their feelings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize finally stopped laughing, her face stern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy has injured so many of us. Stop wasting words. Let me handle him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno looked down his nose at her, clearly not considering Charlize a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held Charlize back, then crooked his finger at Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got the guts to follow me? Let's find a quiet place to settle this one-on-one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal! I'll show you what I'm capable of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno agreed without hesitation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
