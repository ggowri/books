  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked angry and said, "Are you from Ultimate Alliance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava also looked gloomy and said, "This guy must be an imposter. Ultimate Alliance would not have such trash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sanchez was angry and slapped his chest hard. "I am from Ultimate Alliance. Don't you believe me? Do you want me to call all my teammates over and beat you to death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, the waiter of the cafe ran out and whispered, "Sir, Madam, they are indeed members of Ultimate Alliance. We can't afford to offend them. Let's leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes! The people of Ultimate Alliance are very arrogant now. We'd better not provoke them," someone said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah! Keep your voice down and don't get yourself into trouble," another person said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people passing by were talking about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was really angry. He didn't expect others to have such a poor impression of Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Right after Ultimate Alliance became the largest force in Loscity, trash like Sanchez appeared. Alexander felt that it must be properly rectified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out of here right now and leave your woman here. Otherwise, don't blame us for hitting you." They threatened Alexander viciously and looked at him in contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were from Ultimate Alliance and had many followers. What did Alexander want to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sanchez and his men were full of confidence, and they were sure that Alexander would not dare to resist and would have to obey them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked angry and said, "You have ruined the reputation of Ultimate Alliance. You all deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked cold and had murder intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava knew that Alexander was mad, so she quickly took a step back and hid behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sanchez didn't take Alexander seriously at all and shouted recklessly, "I'll count to three. If you don't get out of here and leave that woman here, I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at Sanchez like an idiot and said, "You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you scold me?" Sanchez picked up the wine bottle and smashed it hard on Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!" Alexander's move was as fast as lightning, and the wine bottle hit Sanchez on the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!" Sanchez screamed, hugged his head, and squatted on the ground, blood flowing from his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His companions were all terrified. When they came to their senses, they rushed towards Alexander, howling like wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the people around could react, Alexander kicked them all away individually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The one who flew the farthest reached the other side of the street. Several people were struggling and rolling on the ground, wailing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you hit me? Do you know that I am from Ultimate Alliance? Just wait and see, I will kill you!" Sanchez, with blood all over his head and face, took out his cell phone and started calling for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, Madam, please leave now to avoid trouble," someone said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, leave now, Ultimate Alliance is the largest gang in Loscity," another person said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone tried to persuade them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said expressionlessly, "I'm not leaving. I'm waiting for the people from Ultimate Alliance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was stunned and wondered if he was crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had told him that Ultimate Alliance was now the largest gang in Loscity. But not only did he not run away, he even waited for the people from Ultimate Alliance to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing that Alexander was not leaving, Sanchez grinned. "You are courting dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, more than twenty people ran over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leader was a burly, fat man, about thirty years old, with a fierce look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Martin, this guy slandered Ultimate Alliance, saying that you are nothing!" As soon as Sanchez saw the burly man, he immediately felt like he had seen a savior and started to complain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who dared to insult Ultimate Alliance and even hit you?" Martin was furious when he saw Sanchez and several of his men all had bruised faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Martin, it's him. He doesn't take Ultimate Alliance seriously at all. He said he wanted to deal with the people in Ultimate Alliance." Sanchez pointed at Alexander with a look of resentment. "It's you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Martin roared, but before he could finish his words, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!" Martin showed a terrified expression, shivering and talking to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sanchez quickly agreed, "Yes, damn him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could finish his words, he covered his face and screamed. It turned out that Martin slapped him hard.</span></p><div class="pagination">
