  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A painful expression suddenly appeared on Archer's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his family members died in the plague, but he survived. It was a very </span><span>uncomfortable feeling to be abandoned by the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of excessive grief, Archer convulsed violently. He lost his balance and sat heavily on the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, the experts actually breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Archer still had not been cured. Perhaps he had already used up his last bit of strength and was definitely going to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Archer was really cured, they would be too ashamed to stay in Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made a move and slapped Archer on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Archer screamed and spat out a large mouthful of dark blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reminded calmly, "I just helped you recover, and you must not get excited. If you get excited and die, who will I ask for your 100 million dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Archer spat out a mouthful of dark blood, he calmed down a lot and finally came to his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Alexander blankly, an excited expression on his face, and he tightly grasped Alexander's hand to thank him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, thank you for saving my life! I keep my word and transfer 100 million dollars to you right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer picked up his phone and transferred money to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I hope you can keep your word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander did not care about the 100 million dollars, he would be a fool if he did not accept the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Melin, Eddy, and others were all in shock and ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer transferred the money, knelt in front of Alexander, and begged, "Mr. Hawthorne, you must be sent by God to save us. Please save Loscity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only Archer knelt down, but all the doctors and nurses in Loscity Hospital knelt down, begging Alexander to eliminate the plague and save Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine and dozens of other medical experts all had unhappy expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who just said that people in Loscity are useless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon laughed loudly toward the sky, feeling very proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson was so excited that he was shaking all over. He held Alexander's hand tightly and pleaded, "Mr. Hawthorne, saving lives is the most urgent matter. Please save everyone quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some experts had changed their attitude toward Alexander. From initial contempt, they now had to admire him sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's amazing, and it's a miracle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It turns out that Mr. Hawthorne has developed a special medicine for the plague. The crystal he just fed to Mr. Crawford is that medicine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These experts were eager to try and wanted to consult Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine was still unconvinced and questioned loudly, "I think it's impossible. I must examine Archer's body in person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer was angry and rebuked harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need you to check my body. Are you blind? I'm fine now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine's face turned pale, and she couldn't utter a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she knew before she came that the plague was caused by poison in the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an expert in Risun, Elaine also had other tasks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After researching with several top biologists, she also developed a treatment plan, but it could only extend the patient's life, and at most, it could only be extended by two weeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine never expected that the poison that even she and her team of top experts were </span><span>helpless against was easily cured by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a scary guy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, the extremely proud Elaine felt deeply frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander called Rosalia and asked her to bring the backpack from the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Blunt, as long as these antidotes are added to the water reservoir of the water plant and supplied to thousands of households, so that every patient can drink the detoxified water, the plague can be eradicated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his backpack and showed it was full of antidotes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson was stunned for a moment and asked stupidly, "Mr. Hawthorne, don't you want money? Don't you want to apply for a patent? This is definitely a huge sum of money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "With Mr. Crawford's 100 million dollars, my work was not in vain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, everyone's expressions were very interesting, and the experts' emotions were so overwhelming that they were indescribable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they developed this antidote, they would definitely charge a huge patent fee. It would not be just 100 million dollars, but billions or even tens of billions of dollars.</span></p><div class="pagination">
