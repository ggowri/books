  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... Mr. Payne, let go of me. It hurts so much. Please, don't do this... Can you stop torturing me like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki pleaded with tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, torture you? Isn't this </span><span>a nice game</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker smirked, his tone mocking. "Remember, from now on, don't call me Mr. Payne. You'll address me as Master. You're my slave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he scolded her, Decker forced Kiki to kneel on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Poor Kiki could only </span><span>suck</span><span> </span><span>up</span><span> humiliation, enduring the shame that engulfed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hee..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker chuckled as he stripped off his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the door to Decker's office was slammed open, crashing violently against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker jumped in fright, shuddering as if a gust of cold wind had blown through him. His </span><span>dick </span><span>was flaccid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki nearly had a heart attack. She didn't want anyone to see her in this humiliating state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker </span><span>was frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, Keith walked in leisurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula followed behind Keith. Upon seeing Kiki bound and naked, Paula's face twisted with a mix of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's... Mr. Payne forced me to do this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki stammered, struggling to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she regretted not leaving earlier. If she</span><span> had</span><span> known Decker was such a pervert, she might as well have quit</span><span> directly</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud sound, Keith slammed the door shut behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker's face, previously ashen, softened a little. He didn't know Keith, but he knew Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>eeing </span><span>that Paula was</span><span> intimate</span><span> </span><span>with this man, Decker</span><span> was so mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was no longer obsessed with Paula, she was </span><span>once his whore! </span><span>He didn't expect she would be so bold</span><span>! How dare she stay with</span><span> another man in front of him</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker shot an irritated glare at Paula and snapped, "Paula, what</span><span> are you doing</span><span>? Why are you suddenly bringing a man here? Do you know you've ruined my good time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula gave him an indifferent look, rolling her eyes in disdain, not bothering to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, </span><span>she only liked </span><span>Keith.</span><span> She didn't care about this old bastard </span><span>Decker</span><span> anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula ignored Decker, and Decker became </span><span>more </span><span>furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>turned to Keith and </span><span>questioned</span><span>, "Who </span><span>the hell </span><span>are you? What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith flashed a cold grin, his eyes glinting with mischief. "You must be Decker Payne, one of the leaders of the Sakra Society, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Little brat</span><span>, you'd better show me some respect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker glared</span><span> at </span><span>Keith, his expression full of threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith</span><span> </span><span>casually drew a </span><span>sharp dagger </span><span>from his pocket, pointing it directly at Decker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker's hair stood on end as fear gripped him. The murderous aura radiating from Keith terrified him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you</span><span> want to do</span><span>? I don't even know you... Paula, what is this? How dare you take a killer here to threaten me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a leader of the Sakra Society! If you hurt me, </span><span>my</span><span> higher-ups will never let you get away with </span><span>this</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's face instantly paled, fear flashing in her eyes. The mention of the Sakra Society's vengeance clearly </span><span>scared</span><span> her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith chuckled softly</span><span> and comforted Paula, </span><span>"Don't worry. </span><span>Even </span><span>President Yinson can barely take care of his own problems these days. No one would care</span><span> about</span><span> </span><span>such a</span><span> small </span><span>thing</span><span>. Besides, </span><span>even </span><span>if we kill him, </span><span>who would know that we did it?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's expression relaxed, though still tinged with worry. She turned back to Decker with a sharp tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax, I'm not going to kill you</span><span>. </span><span>Keith just wants to get in touch with</span><span> </span><span>Cyclops.</span><span> </span><span>You won't </span><span>say no</span><span>, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker furrowed his brows. "You're looking for Cyclops?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith then held up a crystal badge that signified his rank. "I'm not an outsider. </span><span>Look at this.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker's tension eased when he saw the badge. He soon realized that Keith was from the Sakra Society</span><span>, </span><span>just a lower-tier member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker </span><span>became confident again and sneered, </span><span>"Keith, since you're one of us, how dare you threaten me? According to Sakra Society rules, you're dead</span><span> meat</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better apologize to me</span><span> right now! O</span><span>r I'll call the higher-ups. They'll teach you </span><span>a lesson!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith spat in Decker's face, a mocking grin on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a dead meat to me. How dare you </span><span>be rude to me</span><span>? You are </span><span>asking for</span><span> death!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
