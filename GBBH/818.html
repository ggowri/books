  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava couldn't stop her whole body trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said in a trembling voice, "Please, come on, I want it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took the initiative to spread her round buttocks apart and rubbed them against Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her coquettish look, Alexander took a deep breath, unzipped his trousers, aimed at the target, and thrust his waist forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava let out a charming moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To stop herself from screaming, she covered her mouth tightly, her upper body slumped on the chair, and her fat buttocks raised high, enduring Alexander's fierce attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Ava felt she couldn't take it anymore, and this time, the pleasure was particularly intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps the occasional footsteps and conversations coming from outside had deeply stimulated Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava could only grit her teeth and cover her mouth with her hands to ensure that she only made slight moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her beautiful face and plump breasts rubbed against the chair as Alexander moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her long hair was spread out, with some parts sticking to her sweaty cheeks, which was indescribably attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at Ava, who was trying her best to endure and was afraid of being noticed, and his desire was unprecedentedly strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He increased his speed and strength, and his lower abdomen hit her plump buttocks fiercely, causing her buttocks to shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of hitting continued, echoing in the small fitting room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! I can't take it anymore... Slow down, please, spare me... I want to scream..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava looked seductive and begged stutteringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander held her buttocks with both hands and moved fiercely regardless of anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava no longer cared where she was. She swung her hips desperately and tried her best to cooperate. She even spread her buttocks, helping him to reach deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander excitedly slapped her on the butt a few times and hit deeply into her while releasing the Force at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava felt as if she had been electrocuted. Her body trembled violently, and she temporarily lost consciousness due to the pleasure...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not knowing how long it took, Ava felt someone holding her in his arms and putting on her bra and skirt for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She opened her hazy eyes and saw Alexander's smiling face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava wanted to stand up, but her whole body felt soft, as if she was stepping on cotton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm so tired, I can't walk anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander held her in his arms and strode out of the fitting room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, several female sales clerks outside were staring at them blankly, with shocked expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava covered her face shyly and quickly buried her head in Alexander's arms. She was too embarrassed to see anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't care what others thought. He hugged Ava, carried the shopping bags, and walked away in a cool manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A female salesperson looked at Alexander's handsome back and couldn't help swallowing hard, looking envious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander asked the driver to take Ava home first, and then he went back to the shopping mall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Ava's birthday was coming, he wanted to prepare a gift secretly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he had plenty of money now, it didn't mean the more money he spent on a gift, the more valuable it would be. Its commemorative significance was more important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, Ava had everything she needed. Alexander knew that no matter what he gave her, she would be very happy, but he didn't want to be so casual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jewelry? Or a new car?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or the most expensive skincare product?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but frown. This task was indeed too difficult for a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the largest shopping mall in Loscity, with all kinds of luxury brands, including expensive watches and jewelry...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The glass of the counter was polished, emitting an alluring glow under the bright lights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those young and beautiful shopping guides, with charming smiles on their faces, were waiting for potential customers to make purchases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Men and women walked by from time to time, either staring at the expensive luxury goods with envy or looking at the beautiful saleswomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander walked around, thinking about what kind of birthday gift he should prepare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was accompanying Ava shopping today, so he was dressed more formally, wearing all branded clothes. The luxurious watch on his wrist sparkled and was very dazzling as he walked.</span></p><div class="pagination">
