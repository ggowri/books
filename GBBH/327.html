  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus had a resentful expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately took out his phone and called Marcos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcos, you have to help me! I was beaten by a guy named Alexander! He's an outsider from </span><span>Loscity</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos didn't want to bother at first, but when he heard it was someone from </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, he perked up. Could it really be that coincidental?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And there are two gorgeous women with him, the prettiest one is also from </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, truly a sexy enchantress. Marcos, you'll definitely like her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus knew Marcos liked beautiful women and immediately flattered him to get revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos became even more excited; maybe he really found them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, send me their photos right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen hurriedly went to find the restaurant staff to check the surveillance footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hated Alexander and felt that this grudge must be avenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen bribed the hotel security personnel and finally obtained the surveillance video, which he then sent to Marcos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing it, Marcos was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really them! We found them without much effort!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, I'm also looking for them. Quickly contact Madelyn and say that you can help her unfreeze the funds, but she must come alone to talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? Will she come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen thought that Madelyn definitely wouldn't fall for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos scolded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you a fool? Just say you're introducing her to Mr. Myers. That's Mr. Myers' requirement; she can only meet him alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The supervisor nodded repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, I'll say I'm introducing her to Mr. Myers; she'll definitely fall for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Madelyn and her team returned to their hotel room, the atmosphere was very tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Alexander had taught Owen a lesson. It felt good, but Avery and Roman still didn't believe Owen would help and thought he might cause trouble instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Avery's attitude toward Alexander had improved significantly, she couldn't help but complain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Using violent means won't solve the problem. Mr. Dukes may have given in verbally, but he'll definitely cause trouble behind our backs. Now, it's even less likely we'll unfreeze the funds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Roman will surely be affected since he's the supervisor; his authority is higher."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn quickly stopped her from continuing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander acted to protect me; he didn't do anything wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn, our main task this time is to unfreeze the funds. Even if Mr. Dukes has gone too far, we could just leave, and there's no need to hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now things have gotten complicated, and you're still defending him. Do you like him or something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery shouted, causing Madelyn's face to turn completely red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander's phone rang; it was Walter messaging him that he had sent someone to pick him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery quickly said, "Stop! You think you can just run away after causing trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at her and coldly replied, "I'm going to find someone who can unfreeze the funds; do you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You? Who do you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery looked at Alexander with suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored the woman, said goodbye to Madelyn, and quickly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery was persistent and chased after him, but although Alexander didn't seem to walk fast, he quickly disappeared from her sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh... this is unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery was left dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the room, Madelyn was worried about how to unfreeze the funds without affecting Roman's work; it was indeed challenging...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her phone rang, and she saw an unknown number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively answered, and a familiar lewd voice came through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Price, hello!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Dukes, is that you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn furrowed her brow; how did this guy know her number?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Price, I've consulted with Mr. Myers, and I've managed to arrange a meeting. But Mr. Myers is very busy and doesn't like too many people around; can you come alone to discuss this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's words made Madelyn feel elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Madelyn felt a bit worried, she believed a mere supervisor wouldn't dare to lie in Mr. Myers' name. It must be because Mr. Myers has a special status that only she could meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further thought, Madelyn quickly tidied up and prepared to go to the appointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also left a message for Avery, just in case.</span></p><div class="pagination">
