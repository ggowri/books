  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on?" Louise whispered, her hand covering her mouth in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander hadn't just slapped Bobby&mdash;he'd hit Shawn too. What shocked her more was that Shawn wasn't retaliating. Instead, he let Alexander strike both cheeks and even tilted his head to make it easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you hit our boss! You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shawn's subordinates, finally processing what had happened, rushed toward Alexander in a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop! Are you all trying to get us killed?" Shawn roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before they could get close, Shawn turned on his men, delivering kicks and punches that left them backing away, trembling in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene left everyone speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Bobby, as clueless as he was, realized something was seriously wrong. He stammered, "Shawn... why did you hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You idiot!" Shawn yelled, his face livid. "Do you have any idea who you just offended?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Alexander hadn't revealed his identity, Shawn didn't dare to spill the secret either. After berating Bobby, Shawn turned and bowed respectfully to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, please punish me however you see fit. But I beg you&mdash;spare the Iron Cobras."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby froze, his blood running cold. He leaned against the table for support as realization dawned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at Alexander, horror dawning in his wide eyes. Could Alice really be the secretary of the Saint Group chairman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was as if a bucket of ice water had been poured over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig, watching the scene unfold, clapped his hands in excitement. "I knew it! She wasn't lying. She really is the chairman's secretary!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other classmates gasped, their gazes shifting between Bobby and Alexander. Pity for Bobby mingled with envy for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nobody had expected Alexander's life to take such a dramatic turn. The man they once pitied had somehow landed someone as elegant and powerful as Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise stood frozen, her mind racing. How on earth did Alexander end up with a woman like Alice? What could she possibly see in him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's voice cut through the stunned silence, cold and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't care about your relationship with Bobby, but I don't want to see him acting arrogant like this again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shawn nodded quickly, trembling. "Understood. I'll take care of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good," Alexander said. "Make sure it's done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shawn bowed deeply. "Thank you for giving me this chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Relief washed over Shawn. If Alexander had decided not to show mercy, the Iron Cobras would've been finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Furious, Shawn spun on his heel and stormed toward Bobby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shawn... wait! What are you doing?" Bobby stammered, panic setting in. "I&mdash;I was wrong! I was wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shawn grabbed Bobby by the collar and slapped him hard across the face. Blood trickled from Bobby's mouth, but Shawn didn't stop. A barrage of kicks and punches followed, leaving Bobby writhing in pain on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You idiot!" Shawn snarled. "Don't you dare mention my name ever again! From now on, we're done. You and I? Over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spat on Bobby before turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shawn's subordinates, equally terrified of Alexander's wrath, took out their frustration on Bobby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because of you, our boss got beaten! You've got a death wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I see you again, I'll break your legs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby lay on the floor, his face swollen and bruised. His screams echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Alexander spoke. "That's enough. He's learned his lesson. Don't kill him&mdash;I don't want this to ruin the reunion. Now get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shawn immediately straightened up, bowing repeatedly. "Yes, of course! We'll leave right away. Enjoy your evening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Shawn led his men out of the room, their deference on full display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the door shut behind them, silence fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one even glanced at Bobby, who lay sprawled on the floor. Not long ago, he had been the center of attention, the one everyone tried to curry favor with. Now, he was utterly abandoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ugh..." Bobby groaned, looking around at his classmates. All he saw were looks of ridicule and mockery. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The same people who once flattered him now regarded him as nothing more than a pathetic fool. Shame burned on his battered face, and all he wanted was to disappear.</span></p><div class="pagination">
