  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone watched in stunned silence as Alexander dragged Kellen into the car and slammed the door shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Norma, stay here. I'll bring Hazel back myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Norma could respond, the car roared to life and sped off into the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to chase after him, but Alexander's command left no room for argument. Frustrated but resigned, she stayed behind, waiting anxiously for his return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without their leader, the Hunter family descended into chaos. Their morale shattered, and Norma seized the opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Round them all up!" she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dragon Gang moved like a well-oiled machine, drawing their weapons in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of dozens of barrels aimed their way sent panic through the Hunter members. Some tried to fight back, but most turned and fled, scattering like leaves in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The forest erupted into chaos as Norma's people quickly captured every last one. No one was getting away to warn the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Alexander reached his destination, he was deep in the mountains, several hundred miles away from </span><span>Kylaville</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Night had fallen, and only the faint moonlight lit the surroundings, making visibility poor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What shocked Kellen the most was that Alexander drove without even turning on the headlights, yet he managed to maneuver the car smoothly and steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason Alexander left the lights off was to remain as discreet as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his x-ray vision, he could see clearly even in complete darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountain range was a nature reserve, sparsely populated and dense with forest. The only sounds came from the occasional chirping of insects and calls of nocturnal birds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander parked the car in a small grove and delivered a sharp chop to the back of Kellen's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even a grunt, Kellen fell unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't wake up for at least three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander bound him tightly, stuffed him into the trunk, and camouflaged the car with branches and leaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without venturing into the grove, no one would suspect there was a vehicle hidden there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the darkness, Alexander sensed numerous wild animals nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid unnecessary trouble, he deliberately unleashed a wave of force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wild animals are highly sensitive to such energy. A moment ago, pairs of predatory eyes had been staring at him, filled with curiosity and aggression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as his energy swept over them, the creatures froze in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the eyes vanished. Leopards, venomous snakes, even a hungry grizzly </span><span>bear... all fled as though they'd encountered a terrifying king of beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's stomach growled audibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his strength wouldn't waver even if he went without food for three or five days, it would still affect his peak performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the information extracted from Kellen, Base One was located in a secluded valley deep within the mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scanning the forest with his x-ray vision, Alexander quickly spotted a rabbit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image of a glistening, golden-brown roasted rabbit filled his mind, making his mouth water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But something seemed off about this rabbit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For one, rabbits are typically nocturnal, staying in their burrows at this hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Secondly, its eyes weren't the usual red. Instead, they glowed a deep, blood-like crimson, and its teeth and claws were unnaturally long and sharp, not features a rabbit should possess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other predators had all fled from Alexander's overwhelming presence, yet this rabbit remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did it stay, but it actually charged at him, as though determined to hunt prey dozens of times its size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rabbit let out a strange noise, </span><span>baring</span><span> its teeth and swiping its claws at Alexander. Its blood-red eyes radiated a sinister intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned, wondering, "What has happened to this rabbit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be some kind of genetic mutation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed his primal energy again, a force potent enough to drive off any beast. Yet it had no effect on the rabbit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, the creature's aggression intensified. Its fur stood on end like a porcupine's quills, and it prepared to launch another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of freakish rabbit is this?" Alexander muttered, a sense of unease creeping over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinct told him this bizarre behavior might be tied to Sakra Society's Base One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a lightning-fast move, Alexander grabbed the rabbit by the scruff of its neck. As the rabbit thrashed and clawed wildly, he noticed a line of black bite marks on its hind leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eerie creature struggled fiercely, its razor-sharp claws slashing toward Alexander's eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
