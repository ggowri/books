Heh, you'll bleed out in less than twenty minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, you've been poisoned. Your body must be paralyzed by now, right? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame was truly unhinged, yelling and screaming in the darkness, openly revealing his location. He clearly didn't take the injured Shadow seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His laughter was like the howl of a hyena, sending chills down the spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how your master died? I stabbed that old man over a dozen times, and he still wasn't dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I tied up his daughter&mdash;your first love&mdash;chopped off her hands and feet, and made them watch each other die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to admit, your woman had a great figure. I couldn't help myself and had some fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even without her hands and feet, it didn't stop me. I bet she was thinking of you when she died, wasn't she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame kept taunting Shadow while moving quickly in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to provoke Shadow into attacking. In his wounded and poisoned state, Shadow would surely lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, everything remained eerily quiet, with no signs of movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame started to panic. Could that bastard Shadow have escaped in the downpour?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted again, "Do you know how horribly she died? After I was done, I cut the flesh off her backside and fed it to dogs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh </span><span>heh</span><span> </span><span>heh</span><span>, let me tell you, those wild dogs enjoyed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your so-called noble assassin family? They looked down on me, giving you the best techniques and not me. Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And yet, the truth is I'm stronger than you! You're nothing but trash, hiding behind a woman's protection and cheating your way into inheriting the family legacy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They were poisoned the same way you are&mdash;neurotoxin. Soon, you won't be able to move and will die like a pig at my hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a pity. Eighteen top-tier assassins, and I slaughtered them like pigs, all by myself. You're the nineteenth and the last... "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame sounded completely deranged, laughing maniacally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he could hear Shadow's heavy breathing and faint footsteps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pretending to notice nothing, he kept laughing wildly while stealthily moving toward the sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was just a few feet away from the breathing, Flame let out a roar and, using a flash of lightning to guide him, lunged toward Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shrill scream pierced the air, and Flame froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that half his body had been severed by a katana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow had embedded his katana between two thick trees. As Flame charged forward, his right side collided with the sharp blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a small trap, but at this moment, it became the final, deadly move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame collapsed to the ground, howling in pain, and quickly begged, "Don't kill me! I'll give you the antidote..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were abruptly cut off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow slit his throat with a dagger. Scalding blood sprayed out, mingling with the </span><span>rain as it flowed onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame's eyes widened in disbelief as the light faded from them. His body slumped to the ground, motionless.</span></p><div class="pagination">
