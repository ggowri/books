  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Mathison, I need to see Mr. Burkart urgently!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Mr. Burkart is in a confidential meeting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Riggs and Misael are dead, and that envoy is a fake! He took off with the woman and Zamir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door swung open, and Arturo stumbled out, looking disheveled and pale. He seized the Risunese man by the neck. "Say that again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The envoy killed Riggs and Misael..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Arturo hurled the Risunese man aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly rallied dozens of Risunese soldiers, torches in hand, and started his pursuit down the mountain with Reece and Raylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander was carrying Zamir on his back while holding Isolde's hand as they hurried down Walgus Hill. Glancing back, he spotted a line of torches rapidly approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anxiety gripped him. The sky was pitch black. Despite the moonlight, the jungle was dense and treacherous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't afford to light torches, relying instead on Zamir to navigate. However, Zamir, being just a child, struggled to see in the dark, so Alexander had to carry the two himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Isolde had surprisingly reached the first level of martial arts, which meant she could at least keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiding in the shadows wasn't a viable option; they'd be trapped by dawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Arturo, a level-four warrior with keen senses, could detect even the faintest sound from a distance. Their only hope was to run as fast as they could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, a figure burst from the forest, carrying Zamir and a young beauty under his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although a level-three warrior would typically exhibit steady breathing, Alexander's handsome face was drenched in sweat, his chest heaving as exhaustion set in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked back at the encroaching torches, a fierce determination ignited in his eyes. He gritted his teeth, summoned all the Force, and surged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde felt her face flush and her heart race as she clung to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't sure if it was intentional or not, but she felt a tingling numbness coursing through her body, rendering her almost powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She chastised herself for not being stronger; after a short while, she couldn't keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde tilted her head slightly to gaze at Alexander, feeling inexplicably drawn to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the front of the group was Arturo, with Reece and Raylan trailing a hundred feet behind, while dozens of Risunese followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo let out a cold snort, his expression grim, and shouted back, "I see him. He's not far ahead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Risunese responded with shouts of surprise and quickened their pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen minutes later, Alexander darted past a stone wall, only to suddenly backtrack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, he spotted a high cave in the wall, accompanied by a small stone tablet engraved with the words "Crematory Ground." It was likely a burial site for the priests of Walgus Church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to see Arturo leaping towards him, clearly about to catch up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with no other choice, he jumped into the cave, set the two down, and instructed firmly, "Go check for an escape route. I'll hold them off here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he pulled out Finn's Life-Saving Pills, uncorked the bottle, and swallowed them all, keeping them tucked under his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Zamir responded and stepped into the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Isolde was on the ground, she felt her entire body go limp, needing a moment to gather herself. Looking at Alexander's figure blocking the cave's entrance, she felt an unexplainable sense of calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far from the cave, Zain suddenly halted, peering into the distance. He spotted a flicker of light moving in the dark ahead and could faintly hear shouting&mdash;it seemed to be the Risunese!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes lit up, and he yelled, "Come on! I'm going in first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan, hearing the commotion, looked up just in time to see Zain dart away, racing toward the flickering flames!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isolde, why are you still here?" Alexander turned around and noticed she hadn't moved, prompting him to shout in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde snapped back to reality, her cheeks flushing as she responded and started to retreat deeper into the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere seconds, Arturo reached the cave's entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strolled toward Alexander, hands clasped behind his back, his gaze fixed on him. His wrinkled face contorted into a frown, and his hoarse voice sent shivers down one's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, why did you suddenly leave without a word?" he asked.</span></p><div class="pagination">
