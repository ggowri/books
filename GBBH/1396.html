  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alexander heard a loud whistling sound breaking through the air behind him. All the hairs on his body stood on end as the saber was about to reach the top of his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander roared and dodged the saber, staggering like a drunk man. With the steel alloy rod in his hand, he swung it. Streaks of light shot out like shooting stars, and every strike aimed at Cedric's vital parts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric let out a strange cry and suddenly soared into the air. In mid-air, he waved his hand, and a sound of shattering metal rang out. Streams of small diamond-shaped black shadows, as fast as lightning, enveloped Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were projectile weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was startled. There was no time to dodge. His body twisted strangely, somehow avoiding the vital parts, but his body was like a sieve, with blood spurting out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander roared in anger. A burst of green protective energy shot out from his left hand. His hand was like a dragon's claw, and he fiercely grabbed and yanked at Cedric in mid-air, using the Dragon's Fury move from "Muscle-Tendon Classic".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mid-air, Cedric was horrified. He felt a huge force pulling him, and he shot towards Alexander like an arrow leaving the bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes shone with a fierce light. He exhaled and shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The muscles of his arms bulged. The steel-alloy rod in his hand shook in the wind, and layers of shadows came crashing down on Cedric's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric was in the air, so he couldn't dodge. There were a series of dull thuds in an instant. By the time he fell to the ground, his body had become a pulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin's three sons were killing the surrounding Risunese. They were about to come and help. But in the blink of an eye, the leader of the group of Risunese was dead. They couldn't help but give Alexander a thumbs-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised an eyebrow and burst out laughing. He held the steel alloy rod and ran towards Fermin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt extremely delighted. He killed a level-four warrior in just a few moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the top of the cliff of Hero Gorge, Frieza suddenly stood up, his face showing surprise. He pressed the combat power detector on his left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Cedric's internal energy had disappeared. Could it be that he..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza rolled his strange eyes and clenched his fists. His whole body was enveloped in a scarlet flame. Invisible airwaves spurted out from his feet, and he shot toward the direction of the Hrodvik camp like a rocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin and Misael were engaged in a fierce battle. There was already a circular shallow pit over three feet in diameter on the ground. No one around them was standing. Fermin's three sons were only level-three warriors and couldn't join the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, Fermin and Misael clashed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander found an opportunity. A burst of green protective energy shot out from his feet. He leaped continuously, and his body shot towards Misael's back in a strange way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After clashing with Fermin, Misael's protective energy in his body was blocked for a moment. Just as he was about to move forward, an inexplicable chill came from behind. He sneered in his heart, lowered his body, and spun the two sabers behind him. The crash sounded, and two half-moon-shaped internal energy, like thunderbolts, blasted straight toward Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander only had time to wave his steel alloy rod. In an instant, there was a series of tinkling sounds. The rod had broken into several parts, and an invisible internal energy rushed towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stomped his foot, and his body shot into the air above Misael's head like a cannonball. He waved his hand, and suddenly, a fierce black tiger appeared. Its huge, blood-filled mouth set off gusts of bloody wind, covering Misael's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Fermin roared, "Night Swords!" In an instant, a purple sword light danced in the air, and layers of purple-gold blade power, like a tight net, enveloped Misael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck!" Misael's face was covered with venom. He waved the two sabers in his hands, slashing horizontally or diagonally and stabbing straight. He was like a hedgehog, with streaks of invisible blade power shooting out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tigris let out a roar in the air. A plate-sized, dazzling electric ball shot out from Tigris' mouth, straight toward Misael's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mid-air, Alexander activated all the protective energy in his body. Using the "Weighty Drop" move, he fell like a meteor. In an instant, he was behind Misael. His hands crossed in front of his chest, drawing an arc back and forth. The green protective energy soared. He suddenly pushed his palms towards Misael, using the "Seismic Cleave" move. A thick layer of internal energy, like the storm from the sky, pressed down on Misael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, there were several bangs. Blood spurted from Tigris' mouth, and it was sent flying dozens of feet, knocking down friend and foe alike along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Misael's hair was disheveled. One saber had pierced through the refined iron armor and penetrated Alexander's right chest. The other saber had been flung out of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's eyes were bloodshot. Golden blood spurted from his right chest. His left hand grasped the saber, and his right fist fiercely struck Misael's Adam's apple, producing a series of thuds.</span></p><div class="pagination">
