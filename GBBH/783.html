  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two powerful white wizards were both after the protective amulet, attacking in unison to seize it. Their combined power put Yvonne in a perilous situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You shameless old fools!" Yvonne yelled, but the amulet couldn't shield her from both attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was thrown to the ground with a heavy thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, the amulet absorbed the brunt of Rock's lethal magic, sparing her from the worst of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Monica and Rock weren't about to let her off that easily. They pursued her relentlessly, determined to claim the amulet. Trapping Yvonne, they made sure she couldn't escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The amulet glowed faintly, casting a soft white light that shielded her from their attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Yvonne was injured, it wasn't serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight of the amulet's power only made Monica and Rock more determined to have it. It was as potent as the one Monica had found in the ancient wizard's tomb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rock, this amulet is far too valuable. I must have it," Monica insisted, her voice sharp with greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock barely acknowledged her, instead shouting at Yvonne, "Hand over the amulet. Surrender, or you'll die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire hall fell silent, all eyes now on the three of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica and Rock were fighting over the amulet, and Yvonne was the cause of their rivalry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne, a dark wizard, was proving to be formidable. Using her speed and the amulet's protection, she held her ground against two powerful white wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of the amulet struck fear in the hearts of the other wizards, but it also ignited a deep desire. They longed to possess such a relic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But fear of Monica and Rock kept them from joining the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, no matter how powerful the amulet was, Yvonne couldn't hold out forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica struck next, unleashing dark magic that filled the hall with thick black mist. It slammed into Yvonne's protective shield with a force that rattled her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yvonne, this is your last chance. Give me the amulet, or you'll suffer," Monica threatened, her voice cold and menacing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock quickly added, "Hand it over, and I'll keep you safe. I swear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne wasn't afraid. She smirked and replied, "My master has many of these amulets. If you want one, become his servant. Maybe he'll reward you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A murmur rippled through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that amulet from Alexander?" one wizard whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible," another disagreed. "There's no way Alexander has more like it. He probably gave her the only one, not realizing its value."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's it," a third said confidently. "He doesn't know what he has."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne chuckled at their narrow-mindedness. "You're all so limited, seeing only what's in front of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was exhausted, sweat dripping from her brow, but the amulet continued to shield her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock sneered. "You can't hide forever, Yvonne. I'll destroy that amulet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He slammed the Ancient Grimoire, and a massive black mist erupted. It coiled into a giant snake that slithered toward Yvonne, wrapping around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The snake squeezed, and Yvonne's protective shield began to crack under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock laughed darkly. "Surrender, Yvonne. In five minutes, your amulet will be shattered, and your bones will be crushed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The amulet's glow was flickering. It could barely hold up against the combined power of the two white wizards for much longer.</span></p><div class="pagination">
