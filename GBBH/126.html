  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's cheeks were flushed as she waited for Alexander's next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hands gently massaged her, gradually moving to her collarbone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the smooth and delicate skin, he couldn't control the desire burning inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the effect of the Force, Ava felt warm all over, as if she was back in the womb, incredibly comfortable and relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but let out a couple of soft hums, making Alexander even more tempted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your massage skills are impressive! I feel so much better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava couldn't help but praise him. Her stiff and aching neck felt completely relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Alexander's hands seemed to have a magical touch, and Ava didn't want him to stop, secretly hoping for more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's desire had already been sparked, especially after Ava's soft moans, which he couldn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, his hand moved down from her collarbone to her full, firm peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The touch was smooth and full, yet soft and elastic, too big to hold with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm! What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava struggled a little, then fell into Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soft, curvy body exuded an enticing fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hand roamed and caressed the beautiful spots, along with the Force's stimulation, making Ava feel utterly weak, only able to let out soft breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava turned around and took the initiative to embrace Alexander, kissing him passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were both eager to remove each other's clothes when suddenly, hurried footsteps echoed in the hallway, getting closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone's coming! I told you we shouldn't..." Ava jumped up in fright, hurriedly fixing her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless. Why did they always get interrupted at critical moments?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had just tidied up, her face still flushed, when the office door was knocked, accompanied by Max's anxious voice. "Ms. Blackburn, are you there? Something's happened!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's expression turned serious. "I'm here; come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max rushed in. When he saw Ava's flushed face and messy clothes, with Alexander glaring at him, he instantly realized they had been intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max couldn't help but smile wryly, hoping he hadn't offended Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, there's a major incident! There's been a mass poisoning at the company. Half the employees are affected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! Mass poisoning?" Ava grew anxious too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Saint Group headquarters had hundreds of employees. Half being poisoned was a severe crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava didn't hesitate and followed Max immediately, with Alexander quickly joining them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked seriously, "Max, what exactly happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max felt more pressure facing Alexander than Ava, considering Alexander's skills and his role as the developer of magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought carefully, then answered cautiously, "It seems something went wrong at the lunch gathering. We were celebrating becoming the magic powder distributor, so we had a buffet at the restaurant, and then everyone suddenly got sick, possibly food poisoning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander connected it to his daughter Ashley's poisoning incident, suspecting a link between the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that simple. Someone must have poisoned them to target the Saint Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's conclusion shocked both Ava and Max.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Poisoning? Could it be Sebastian? He's capable of such despicable acts." Ava was filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not Sebastian. He recently suffered a setback and is under my control, so he </span><span>wouldn't dare. It's definitely not him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander confidently ruled out Sebastian but didn't say directly it might be his second brother's doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his eldest brother Guzman was a ruthless leader, his second brother was a schemer who'd stop at nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a mass casualty event happened at the Saint Group, not only would they lose the magic powder distributorship, but the whole company might face investigation and closure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the chairman, he would be implicated, possibly facing jail time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, some might use safety issues as a reason to seize the magic powder rights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coupled with the compensation for hundreds of deaths, the financial burden would be astronomical, threatening the very existence of the Saint Group.</span></p><div class="pagination">
