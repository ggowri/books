He lowered his head and said, "Head Priest Hezekiah, these two are Risuneses caught red-handed stealing Verdant Crown Melons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasted no time accusing them, even embellishing the story with extra details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hezekiah frowned and pointed at Logan, who was huddled to the side. "You tell me what happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan glanced at Alexander. Seeing that he was sleeping soundly and seemed unharmed, he finally let out a sigh of relief. Then, he launched into an exaggerated retelling of the events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recounted everything in vivid detail. "We were watching a movie when we suddenly got burned and ended up here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of surprise flashed in Hezekiah's eyes, but he simply smiled. "So, you really aren't from around here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald narrowed his eyes slightly, feeling more confident. He leaned closer to Hezekiah and asked, "Head Priest Hezekiah, you saw through them from the start! Who knows what other crimes these Risuneses have committed? I plan to take them to Darwin Court tomorrow morning and have them properly punished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Turning them over to the authorities? A runaway Risunese faces the death penalty," Hezekiah murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pockmarked worker beside him bent forward with a fawning smile. "Head Priest Hezekiah, you truly know the law well! According to Hrodvik's laws, runaway Risuneses are indeed sentenced to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald shot the man a look of approval and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others quickly chimed in, nodding in agreement. "They deserve the death penalty..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander had been drifting between consciousness and unconsciousness. Before he blacked out, his back had exploded in pain. But just as he was losing himself to the darkness, he felt a sudden warmth bloom in his chest. A scorching current surged through his body, small but intense, as if the fire was coursing through his veins. It forced out the blood that had been clogging his chest, making him cough it up in one violent burst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the abyss of unconsciousness, he felt a gentle, multicolored glow wrapping around his chest, cool and soothing. It was like being bathed in a soft breeze, every pore of his body drinking in that strange rainbow light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain vanished. His body felt weightless, relaxed to the point where he almost didn't want to wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faint voices reached him. Then, he heard Logan's familiar tone. Slowly, he regained awareness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lifting his head, he saw Donald, the cruel friar, surrounded by a group of people, all gathered around an elderly friar in golden robes. They looked at him with a reverence that bordered on worship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old friar's eyes gleamed like twin stars, sharp and penetrating. The moment their gazes met, Alexander felt as if the man could see straight through him. A nervous chill ran down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slowly got to his feet. He reached out and patted Logan, who was still talking animatedly. "Logan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander! You're awake? Are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan spun around, giving him a once-over, then wiped the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled warmly. "I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hezekiah suddenly stepped forward, standing before them. He raised his right hand and gently rested it on their heads, murmuring a quiet incantation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan felt no urge to resist. Something about the old friar felt incredibly kind and reassuring. They simply stood still, letting him touch their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they heard a soft crack from the crowns of their heads, as if something had shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rush of cool energy flooded through them, washing over their entire bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shuddered involuntarily. A strange clarity filled their minds as if something had awakened inside them. Strength surged through their limbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why have you come here so late at night?" Hezekiah asked gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a steadying breath, then mimicked the old friar's posture, and thanked him in a respectful gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, we are not bad people. We were mistaken for thieves because of a language barrier. They beat us all the way here, and now our bodies are covered in bruises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he turned his back to them and lifted the hem of his short-sleeved shirt. Angry red welts crisscrossed his back. It was clear evidence of the beating he had endured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hezekiah listened carefully, then turned to Donald. His piercing gaze darkened with unmistakable menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lies! He's making it up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald panicked. He hadn't expected Hezekiah to perform a Spiritual Awakening on these two Risuneses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other workers hurried to back him up, their voices rising in protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father Hezekiah, we've been losing melons left and right! They were caught in the act!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They even attacked our people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his allies support him, Donald's eyes gleamed with malice. He turned to Hezekiah and said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Head Priest Hezekiah, just look at their strange clothes. People like that sneaking around a melon field in the dead of night? How could they possibly be innocent? They have to be runaway Risuneses slaves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Runaway Risuneses are supposed to be executed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But since you are merciful, I will plead with the judge to have them exiled instead."</span></p><div class="pagination">
