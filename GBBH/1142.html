  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You piece of crap! You want a fight? Bring it on!" Brock was beyond angry. He knew begging for mercy wouldn't help. If he was going to die, he'd at least take a few of them down with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really think you can kill us all? Come on, you bastard! If you </span><span>wanna</span><span> kill me, let's see who goes down first!" Brock spat, tightening his grip on the machete, his eyes burning with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not afraid to die?" Stephen said coldly, his gaze icy and full of menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am." Brock shot back, his teeth gritted. "But are you </span><span>gonna</span><span> let us live? You think you'll spare us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen smirked. "You've still got a chance to live..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, his blade flashed out, cutting through the air with a deadly whistle. Brock jumped back, barely managing to dodge the strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's the deal. Give me all your money, all your assets, and swear your loyalty to me. This woman? She's mine, too. Maybe then, I'll let you walk away." Stephen's voice dripped with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck you! You want to kill me and take my money and my woman? You're out of your damn mind! I'll fight you to the end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guys, kill him, and you'll each get a million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brock's offer immediately fired up his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brock, let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brock, we are not </span><span>gonna</span><span> let him walk all over us. Does he think we're pushovers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brock and his crew had been through their fair share of battles. They weren't rookies. They'd made their mark on </span><span>Louvian</span><span> by spilling blood and building a fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hell, a bunch of ants can still bring down an elephant. Let's hit him from all sides!" Brock ordered, and the five of them surrounded Stephen, machetes flashing in the light, gleaming with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen didn't flinch. He just smirked as if the whole thing was a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all dead." Brock's eyes were wide, his voice full of rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five men lunged in unison, slashing their blades in a deadly arc, closing in from every direction. The air seemed to crackle with the intensity of their attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all in now, fighting for their lives and luxury, willing to trade everything, including their own lives, to get out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joaquin and the others stood frozen, their hearts pounding. If any of them were in Brock's position, they'd be dead already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Merrett, be careful!" Joaquin shouted in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blades came crashing down in a deadly pattern, a web of death closing in on Stephen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hesitated for even a second, he was done. Even if he killed a few, he couldn't escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen's expression didn't change. He barely even moved. "Is this really all you've got? You're a bunch of amateurs..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in the blink of an eye, when their blades came down, he was gone. One second, he was there, and the next, it was like he never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed was inhuman, faster than anyone could track. All they saw was a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" A scream rang out as one of Brock's men suddenly found his right hand severed in a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hand and machete flew through the air and landed with a sickening thud. Blood sprayed everywhere, and the man staggered, clutching at the stump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, Stephen was already on him. A single clean swipe and his throat was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head flew off like a bowling ball, rolling away from the body, which crumpled to the ground, blood pouring from the neck like a fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen's movements were so fast, and they seemed almost supernatural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another scream echoed through the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A second headless body hit the floor with a sickening thud, its severed head rolling nearby, eyes wide open in frozen terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with the sounds of screams as four bodies collapsed to the ground, their heads rolling away, eyes open in their final moments, refusing to close even in death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The brutal carnage unfolded like a grotesque spectacle, but to Stephen, it was nothing more than a grim feast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deliberately spared Brock, standing over him with an air of superiority. The look in his eyes, cold and mocking, sent a wave of fury and terror through Brock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brock's hand shook uncontrollably as he gripped his knife, realizing with sickening clarity that he was completely outmatched. It was a slaughter, plain and simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never faced an opponent like this. His heart dropped into his stomach, and a deep, crushing despair settled over him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
