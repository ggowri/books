  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma had no other choice but to ask Alexander for help because, in her mind, Alexander was an omnipotent being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kylaville</span><span> was an international metropolis with a population of over 100 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dragon Gang, despite its significant influence, was one among many large and small organizations in the city. So was the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding a missing young woman here was almost impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let Vivian go back first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian didn't dare to resist, but before leaving, her eyes towards Haruko were full of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored it. This was what happened when he had too many women around. They would envy each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. Take me to your sister's room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma hurriedly led the way, and Alexander followed behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Haruko's round and plump buttocks twisting back and forth, Alexander couldn't help but spank her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma snorted softly, blushed, and snuggled into Alexander's arms, being held forward by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards following behind them lowered their heads quickly and didn't dare to look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their feelings were very complicated at the moment. After all, Norma was their unattainable dream lover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander then entered Hazel's room and used his vision to search carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, this thing is a bit weird!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found a crystal tag from under the quilt. It had a skull carved on it and the number "89" on the skull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Alexander was a bit worried and said with certainty, "This is a dog tag."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma asked in confusion, "What is a dog tag? Is it for dogs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander explained with a complicated expression, "This kind of dog tag is not for dogs, but for women. Your sister is playing a master-servant game with a man, and this is the dog tag that man gave her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... Master-servant game? What...are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haruko was wholly dumbfounded and couldn't believe that her sister was playing this kind of game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed the crystal tag and said word by word through gritted teeth, "I remember it! A branch of the Sakra Society likes to do this kind of thing, and they are targeting my sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those bastards like to torture and be tortured. They are all sadists. Some of them are willing, and some are forced...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The level of Hazel's dog tag is not high. She must have just joined them not long ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma was filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She accidentally knocked a glass ornament off the table, and it fell to the ground, breaking into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, you have to save my sister. Please save her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She must have been forced. She must have been forced by the Sakra Society. She is not a dog slave. Please save her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma had become incoherent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted Norma's shoulder, his expression complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I will definitely save her, but maybe she left voluntarily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! She wouldn't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma bit her lower lip, her eyes filled with anger. Whoever hurt Keiko must pay the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, someone came running in to report, "Ms. Walsh, we found clues about Ms. Hazel Walsh. She might be in the Night Devil Club!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma was thrilled and quickly prepared to set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander also got into her car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of cars and hundreds of people headed towards the Night Devil Club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Night Devil Club was not located in the city center but on a small commercial street in the suburbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was very remote, with few people in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several burly men were guarding the door of the club, and no one was allowed to enter without an invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After entering the club, a depressing atmosphere hit every comer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The space was decorated in a dark style, lacked windows, and the ventilation was outdated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it wasn't stuffy, the lighting was dim, and there was an eerie atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The darkness inside the club and the bright world outside were like the difference between hell and heaven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me another drink!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sexy young beauty, holding a wine glass, gestured to the bartender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore heavy makeup, completely hiding the childishness on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She possessed an unusually mature and voluptuous figure for her teens, exuding a charm beyond her years.</span></p><div class="pagination">
