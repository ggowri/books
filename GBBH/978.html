  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave clapped her hands in delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's definitely a diluted treasure worth a fortune!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Indeed, the ring's value is immeasurable, but even more priceless is Mr. Vance's true heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Lawson, you should accept the marriage proposal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Asher heard that everyone was supporting him, the smile on his face suddenly became even bigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace pushed the ring away expressionlessly and said coldly, "Sorry, I don't have feelings for you. I never liked you, so I can't agree to your proposal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Silence fell over the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher was stunned, then erupted in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, are you going to force Ms. Lawson to marry you? This is Loscity. You can't just wreak havoc here," Alexander interjected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fuming, Asher looked for someone to vent his frustration on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You shut your mouth, your disgraceful fool who gives cheap gifts. How dare you show off in front of me?" he spat at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander retorted, "That ring is not the Eros Ring. It's the Cursed Ring. Whoever wears it won't live long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gasps of shock rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're talking nonsense!" Asher shouted, furious. "Do you know what the Eros Ring means? If it weren't for Grace's birthday, you wouldn't even be allowed to see it. How dare you slander me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered, "If my ring isn't a treasure, then what's in that little box you gave me? Show everyone if you can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My gift?" Alexander replied calmly. "Are you sure you want to see it? Don't regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hahaha!" Asher laughed. "You're a clown. If your gift is better than my ring, I'll apologize. But if you lose, get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whispers spread through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think Mr. Hawthorne will lose. The Eros Ring is definitely a treasure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne made a mistake this time. Could it be that he wants to compete with Asher for Grace?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's certainly feasible. Grace is the granddaughter of Avalora's second most important figure. If Alexander secures her, it will elevate him significantly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was whispering to each other, and most of them were not optimistic about Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace, concerned for Alexander, pulled him back. "Forget it, don't compete with him. The gift you gave me is the best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words silenced the crowd, revealing her feelings for Alexander. Envious glances fell on him, wondering how he had captivated such a stunning beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher furiously yelled, "What? Are you too scared to compete and want to hide behind a woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander shook his head and approached Asher, lightly touching the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher blinked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you want?" he roared subconsciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, look at this ring again. Notice the change," Alexander said, pointing at the Cursed Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd gasped, their expressions shifting dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This! How is this possible?" Asher cried in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The once-dazzling diamond ring had turned black, lacking any luster and exuding a cold, deathly aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were two completely different rings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander used the Force to destroy the disguise of the Cursed Ring, revealing its true appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He explained, "This is a cursed ring created by an ancient sorcerer that drains the wearer's life force to sustain itself. I suspect it was dug up from an ancient tomb."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was immediately shocked after hearing Alexander's explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's face turned pale, and he took a breath of cold air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, he hadn't spent a billion dollars on the ring. He had indeed obtained it from an ancient tomb.</span></p><div class="pagination">
