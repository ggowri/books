  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall was a massive square room that stretched on forever&mdash;easily a hundred feet across and at least fifty feet high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luminous pearls were embedded in the pale yellow walls, casting a soft glow throughout the space. The floor was lined with pristine emerald, giving the whole place a seriously luxurious vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wide wooden staircase dominated the center of the hall. Next to it sat an ornate meditation couch made of golden wood, with a cushion placed on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged priest in robes sat there in meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had full, dignified features with distinctive eyebrows and closed eyes. Despite his solemn appearance, there was something graceful about him&mdash;like someone who could unravel the mysteries of the universe just by thinking about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Follow me," the kid in gray robes said to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked with him until they stood before the meditating man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kid bowed respectfully to the man. "This is Mr. Trevor Owein from the Hina Sect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly stepped forward and gave a polite bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor opened his eyes slightly to glance at Alexander before speaking in a measured tone, "Aldric, give him the library pass." Without another word, he returned to his meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldric smiled and pulled out a small booklet, handing it to Alexander. "The stairs are right over there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving Aldric a quick nod, Alexander took the pass and headed straight up to the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight took his breath away&mdash;the entire hall was lined with towering bookshelves made of precious wood. Every shelf was packed with books, and a handful of disciples browsed quietly between the aisles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face lit up as he eagerly stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, he stumbled back with a thud, rubbing his forehead. It felt like he'd just walked straight into an invisible wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weird," he muttered, flipping open the library pass to take a closer look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second floor of the Manual House contained the church's basic techniques. Any lay disciple could check them out, but it cost a thousand silver coins for two hours of reading time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third floor housed the church's seventy-two special skills. New lay disciples could study any one manual of their choice, again for a thousand silver coins per two-hour session.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander wanted to study additional techniques, he'd need to drop 10 thousand martial virtue points for the privilege, plus two thousand silver coins for each two-hour session.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fourth floor held the church's signature techniques&mdash;the real deal. Those would set him back a hundred thousand martial virtue points, with each two-hour study session costing a whopping 10 thousand silver coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fifth floor was totally off-limits unless he was an inner disciple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there was a big warning at the bottom: [Anyone caught teaching these techniques to outsiders without permission gets kicked out and has their martial core destroyed...]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a weight settle in his chest as he finished reading. The rules here were brutally practical. He either paid up or he didn't get to read, simple as that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind drifted to an ancient story he'd read. The story went something like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two angels had brought a saint to see their sacred texts. They turned to him and said, "So, you've come all the way from your country. What gifts did you bring us? Hand them over, and we'll let you have the scriptures."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The saint replied, "I didn't bring anything. The journey was too long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two angels burst out laughing, "Oh, that's rich! If we just gave away our teachings for free, future generations would starve!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, when word got out about them passing on a blank scripture, someone ratted them out to the divine authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the divine one just chuckled, "Calm down, everyone. I know exactly why those two asked him for payment. Look, these teachings aren't some casual handout&mdash;you can't just grab them for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember when those saints went down to that rich guy's place in Shravasti? They recited the scripture once. They guaranteed safety for his living relatives and salvation for his dead ones. All they got was three measures of golden grain. I actually thought they undersold it. What are their children supposed to live on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So when this guy shows up empty-handed? Of course, they gave him blank pages. This is the lesson, and honestly, it's perfect. Those stubborn, confused folks in your country? That's all they're ready for anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Alexander felt a tiny flutter in the golden energy near his heart. His mind suddenly cleared, like someone had wiped the fog from a window. His Spiritual Awakening kicked into overdrive, and everything made so much more sense. It was like puzzle pieces clicking into place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Man," he thought, "the angels weren't kidding about future generations starving if teachings were given away for free. When you're spreading wisdom in the world, you've got to deal with people who only believe in cold, hard cash. If every enlightened being just conjured up money whenever they needed it, the whole system would go off the rails!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How do we know these magical riches won't just turn into sticks and stones? Would that end up helping people or hurting them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The average saint didn't have any special powers or deep pockets. How were they supposed to spread the truth to the masses?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the same story for all the devoted followers trying to share their message. If they looked broke and desperate themselves, who would take their spiritual wisdom seriously in this materialistic world?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Money and truth weren't enemies&mdash;they could actually work together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let them learn from a blank book," the divine voice had said. "Those people in your country are too stubborn and lost in their own ignorance. This is the only way to get through to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more Alexander thought about it, the deeper it hit home. Most people were caught up in their own drama, carrying around mountains of emotional baggage. The divine teachings spelled everything out crystal clear, but hardly anyone bothered to really listen.</span></p><div class="pagination">
