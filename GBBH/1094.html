  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas felt a chill run through his body, his limbs trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until Alexander had disappeared from sight that he snapped back to reality, gnashing his teeth in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn him... How dare he threaten me! Just wait, I'll make sure you don't die a peaceful death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pulled out his phone and dialed a number, a malicious grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can't escape now, kid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander had just met Alvin and Maxine in the club's lobby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine immediately rushed toward him, her face lighting up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled faintly and patted her back reassuringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the sound of chaotic footsteps grew louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of at least thirty or forty men stormed into the lobby from all directions. At the front was a stocky middle-aged man with a buzz cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas had followed them, and when he saw his men had arrived, his mood lifted instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pointed at Alexander and barked, "Hector, grab him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hector, with a swift motion, pulled out a Desert Eagle, its dark barrel aimed directly at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas laughed maniacally. "You think you can escape, kid? Even if you could sprout wings and fly, you're not getting away today. You're in way over your head if you think you can fight me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kneel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did you hear me? Kneel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas screamed, and his voice was laced with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd just been beaten badly, and now that he felt he had the upper hand again, he was eager to exact his revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both Alvin and Maxine were paralyzed with fear. They knew that at this range&mdash;barely five meters&mdash;there was no way Alexander could dodge the bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sighing, Alexander shook his head in resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To think, this is how the so-called tough guys operate..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For ordinary people, a gun was an unbeatable weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even skilled martial artists couldn't compete with modern firearms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for Alexander, even when he had just unlocked the Ultimate Legacy, a handgun posed no real threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, as an advanced Warrior, standing just a few meters away from Hector and his gun, Alexander didn't feel any danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Alexander shake his head, Thomas grinned with cruel satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You still think you're tough? Well, try to be smart and keep that attitude. Let's see if you can survive this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pain from his previous injuries flared up as he spoke, causing Thomas to break into a cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hector shouted, "Kneel! Do you hear me? Kneel, or I'll break your legs right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go ahead, shoot me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said calmly, an ironic smile playing at his lips as he stepped toward Hector. "Aren't you afraid to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hector froze, instinctively taking a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't understand it&mdash;why wasn't this guy afraid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander continued his slow advance, maintaining that same cold, contemptuous smile. With each step, he drew closer to Hector.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fool! If you want to die, I'll grant your wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Hector's eyes flashed with rage, and he fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gunshot rang out, the bullet aiming for Alexander's thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Alexander's pace quickened, and the bullet whizzed past him, embedding into the marble floor with a loud crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hector fired again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Alexander sidestepped, the bullet grazing past him and missing by a hair's breadth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hector's face went pale as he fired three more shots in quick succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang, bang, bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three bullets formed a triangle, all aimed at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Hector's shock, all the bullets passed clean through Alexander's body, leaving deep craters in the floor beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh no!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hector cried out in disbelief, realizing that he had been shooting at a mere afterimage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander appeared next to him like a ghost, moving so fast Hector barely registered his movement. He grabbed Hector's right hand&mdash;the one holding the gun&mdash;and twisted it behind his back, pressing Hector's own gun to his chest. Without missing a beat, Alexander fired three shots in rapid succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang, bang, bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each shot tore through Hector's chest, creating a massive hole in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The group stood frozen in horror, watching as Hector's lifeless body crumpled to the ground, his eyes wide open in death, still in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire room fell silent. It took a moment before anyone could move, but when they did, the first person bolted, fleeing in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One by one, the others followed, their faces pale with fear, as if they'd just seen a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within seconds, the area around Thomas was empty, his men scattering like cockroaches. They all kept their distance, horrified, unwilling to be near him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas' face twisted in fear as he stammered, "Don't... Don't kill me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander scoffed, and his gaze was cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why would I kill you? I was just defending myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas let out a sigh of relief, realizing that Alexander wasn't one to kill in front of an audience, at least not yet.</span></p><div class="pagination">
