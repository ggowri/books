  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin shuddered violently, and immediately after, the heartbeat line on the monitor stabilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Alexander slapped Gavin's head again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The force surged into his head, slowly clearing the blood congestion in his brainstem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything unfolded under Alexander's All-seeing Eyes, without harming Gavin's brain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Alexander withdrew his hand, Gavin, who had been lying motionless, let out a faint groan, startlingly clear in the quiet room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! Dad, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale and Grace rushed to the bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others stood stunned, hardly believing their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially Matt and the other doctors, who had never seen anything so strange. They could only describe it as a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank God!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden cheered, his face lighting up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the Lawson family found out what had happened. They began murmuring excitedly, clapping their hands and celebrating like they'd risen from the depths of hell to heaven, spared from death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, how did you do that? Can you teach me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matt asked eagerly, his face filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander merely smiled slightly, clasped his hands behind his back, and answered calmly,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's not that I won't teach you. It's just that you wouldn't be able to learn it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matt was stunned, his face turning bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Howard's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been waiting for Alexander to make a fool of himself, but he never expected Alexander to actually bring Gavin back from the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander waved at Howard. "Come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Me? For what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard glared at Alexander suspiciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's expression didn't change. "I'm talking to you. Come over here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard pointed at Alexander's nose. "Who the hell do you think you are? You think you can boss me around? Believe me, I'll have someone kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's face darkened, and she was about to snap back, but before she could, Alexander moved in a flash, grabbing Howard by the collar and pulling him closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You were outside slandering me as a fraud. Now, in front of everyone, you need to apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard struggled, cursing furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, you want my apology? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Howard, you slandered me first. Not only are you refusing to apologize, but now you're insulting me again. Don't make me show my claws. Just because I'm not showing them doesn't mean I'm weak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold, dangerous glint flashed in Alexander's eyes. He kicked Howard's lower leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sharp sound of bones breaking echoed, and Howard screamed in pain, collapsing to his knees in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Howard wasn't Jaden's biological son, he had been adopted. Seeing someone break Howard's leg in public was too much for many to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd erupted in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bodyguards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to have children of his own, he had always treated Howard like a son. Seeing him hurt in front of him was unforgivable. He was determined to get justice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of bodyguards rushed in, surrounding Alexander like wolves ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale and Grace shouted in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jaden, what are you doing? Mr. Hawthorne is our family's benefactor. Without him, Sir Lawson would be gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale scolded her brother sharply while shooting a fierce glare at Howard, who was lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Howard, you slandered Mr. Hawthorne and insulted him publicly. Breaking one of your legs is already showing mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden froze, unable to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale turned to Alexander, bowing deeply in gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne, for helping us again. The Lawson family is truly grateful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace threw her arms around Alexander's, smiling brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, he's family! Of course he helped Grandpa. You don't need to thank him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words stunned everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace, the only heiress of the Lawson family, had always been blunt with men. But now, in front of everyone, she was openly affectionate with Alexander. It was clear: Alexander was going to be her future husband, his status far surpassing Howard's.</span></p><div class="pagination">
