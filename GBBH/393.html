  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Nonsense!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella snapped, unable to hold back her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Everyone, stop talking!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren quickly stepped in to calm the group chat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Mrs. Powell, we've always treated every child equally. Please refrain from making </span><span>such shameless comments. Having money doesn't make anyone superior here.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy explained quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Darren, I'm only trying to help the preschool. Unlike Ashley's dad, who didn't contribute a penny yet accused me of guilt-tripping! Isn't that just infuriating?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[If he has the guts, he should donate fifty thousand dollars too! If not, he should just stay out of this. I don't want to talk to him!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy kept provoking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could respond, Darren was already alarmed. Alexander was a major donor to the preschool, and no insult to him would be tolerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Mrs. Powell, be quiet! Mr. Hawthorne donated three million to build a private path and ten million to upgrade our facilities.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy froze, then immediately switched to flattery mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[He donated that much? Which Mr. Hawthorne is this? I can't believe we have such a generous parent at our preschool. Darren, could you introduce us? I'd love to meet him.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Hmph! Mr. Hawthorne has no interest in meeting you.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren chuckled coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy was growing increasingly anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Darren, stop teasing and tell me! I need to thank him properly.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other parents in the chat were also curious; anyone who could casually donate over ten million must be a big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella was also puzzled; when had the preschool gotten a wealthy parent? This wasn't exactly an elite school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Darren sent a message: [This Mr. Hawthorne is none other than Ashley's dad!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group chat fell silent, as if the air had frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy's face turned pale, then flushed in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, she'd been mocking Ashley's dad, only to find out he'd donated over ten million dollars, hundreds of times more than her fifty thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy protested: [Darren, are you tricking us? He was demanding money from me this morning. How could he afford that much?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren promptly sent a screenshot of the deposit in the chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirteen million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group chat went silent again, as parents on the other end stared in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy sat there, deflated, like a popped balloon. Her arrogance was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren chuckled. [Mrs. Powell, let's remember. There's always someone better out there. Rich or poor, we're all equal here.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Yes, I was wrong. My mistake. I'm sorry.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy begrudgingly offered an apology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just middle class. She couldn't afford to offend someone who could casually donate over ten million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander calmly sent a message: [Mrs. Powell, I'll forgive you for the child's sake this time. But if it happens again, I'll see you out of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His firm words left Mandy trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly sent Alexander a private apology, only for him to block her immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy felt restless, repeatedly apologizing in the group chat, her pride completely shattered. Only then did the donation controversy settle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella had been holding her phone, her expressions changing from anger to sarcasm to excitement. When Mandy finally apologized repeatedly in fear, Ella burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another teacher asked curiously, "Ella, what's so funny?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella put down her phone, her face slightly flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, it's nothing. We just have an interesting parent in our class."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teacher grinned knowingly. "Is it a handsome dad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? What are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella blushed, looking a little flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aha, I knew it. You've got a thing for him, don't you? Come on, spill. Do you want to ask him out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella rolled her eyes. "What are you thinking? That's impossible. He has a daughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teacher scoffed. "</span><span>So</span><span> what if he has a daughter? Maybe he doesn't have a wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella thought for a moment. "He was my childhood neighbor and saved me twice. So, I wouldn't say it's love. It's more of a special feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, he's definitely handsome...and rich!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
