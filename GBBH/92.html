  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt a tightening in his pants, a mix of embarrassment and desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He forced a smile and said, "Hold your horses; we've got bigger fish to fry. You don't need to worry about Billy; I'll handle him. Just sit tight and wait for the fallout."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty's heart raced at his words, and she nodded before quickly turning to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she walked away, her hips swayed enticingly, and Alexander couldn't help but feel a surge of heat rise within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't that he didn't want her; he just felt guilty about Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the last time with Betty was just a matter of detoxification.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pulled out his phone and called Augusta, assigning him the task of dealing with Billy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Augusta had been introduced to him by Billy, and it was a good opportunity to test the loyalty of Augusta and his crew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once he hung up, Augusta's face lit up with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin, sensing something was up, quickly asked, "Captain, what's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta grinned, saying, "We finally get a chance to thank the boss! That scumbag Billy has the audacity to betray the boss. Let's show him how to behave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sounds like a plan! I've got nothing better to do," Marvin replied, flashing a wicked grin that revealed his gleaming white teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Alexander's phone buzzed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Jane calling. He almost hit decline but noticed her message. She wanted to meet to discuss their daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Reluctantly, he agreed to meet her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half an hour later, he arrived at the agreed spot, where Jane was already waiting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had clearly put in some effort, dressed in a sleek black skirt, her makeup flawless, exuding an alluring scent with every gesture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, Sebastian has put a five-million-dollar bounty on your head. You need to be careful! I don't want anything to happen to Ashley's father. I hope you stay safe," Jane said, her tone unusually concerned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's shift in demeanor surprised him. After witnessing Alexander's strength multiple times, she genuinely regretted her past actions and was hoping to use Ashley as a bridge to reconnect with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm busy. What do you want? Spit it out; I don't have all day," Alexander replied curtly, his patience wearing thin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Old habits died hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Jane had turned a new leaf, Alexander's feelings for her had long since faded. Some things, once lost, could never be reclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To his surprise, Jane didn't lash out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead, she adopted a soft, almost pleading tone. "Alexander, I'm here to apologize. I was blind to everything before. It was my fault. I shouldn't have cheated, shouldn't have pushed you to divorce, and I definitely shouldn't have walked away from our daughter..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears streamed down her face as she continued, "I was wrong. Please forgive me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I really understand now; I'll change. Can't we just be a family again? Ashley needs both of us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She leaned into him, wrapping her arms around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she sobbed, Alexander felt a wave of conflicting emotions wash over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had anticipated this moment, knowing that once he embraced his identity as the Godfather's illegitimate son and obtained the Ultimate Legacy, Jane would eventually regret her choices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he hadn't expected it to come so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane, we can't go back to how things were. If you truly understand your mistakes, then respect my boundaries," Alexander said firmly, pushing her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stunned, Jane stood there, her once-beautiful face shifting between shades of red and white.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... I've apologized. Can't you just forgive me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed she couldn't grasp the reality of his rejection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had humbled herself, offered a heartfelt apology, and made a desperate plea for forgiveness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, an angry shout pierced the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander! I'll tell Ava everything!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A blue sports car screeched to a halt by the curb. Rebecca rolled down the window and furiously pointed at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! So you think you're so slick, going out with your ex-wife and hugging her in public? I'm definitely going to tell Ava and expose your hypocritical mask!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without waiting for Alexander to respond, Rebecca sped off, leaving him standing there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The confrontation left Alexander feeling anxious about Ava's possible reaction, darkening his mood considerably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just go. We're never getting back together. If you truly regret your actions, then at least ensure you're a good mother to our daughter. Make sure Ashley doesn't lack for maternal love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Alexander turned on his heel and walked away.</p><div class="pagination">
