  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over an hour later, Alexander finally carried Ava back to the big bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clung to him tightly, her cheeks flushed with shyness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he gently caressed her alluring figure, he reveled in the warmth of her affection and admiration, feeling an overwhelming sense of satisfaction and happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force that James had passed on to him had been absorbed a bit more; the idea that having sex with a woman could enhance his strength was simply marvelous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, fully mastering and absorbing James' Force was still a long way off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he felt a surge of excitement, Alexander</span><span> wanted it again</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, sensing the shift, quickly became alarmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! You're too powerful; I'm exhausted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I won't go overboard," he assured her, tightening his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With tears glistening in her eyes, Ava said, "Alexander, you can't ever abandon me. I wouldn't be able to live without you. As long as you love me wholeheartedly, I can overlook anything&mdash;even if it means sharing you with other women. I won't hold it against you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "You'd really be okay with me having other women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot him a playful glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh please, don't you men know what you're like? Just make sure you love me completely, and keep your dirty deeds away from my sight. If I find out, you'd better believe I'll make you pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, unsure if Ava was being serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing his silence, she sighed internally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, during their intimate moments, Ava had spotted red marks on his skin from </span><span>kisses and scratches on his back, which were clearly left by another woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ava chose not to address it. She could feel Alexander's love and protection for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their social circle, such things were all too common; a young, handsome, and capable man would naturally attract the attention of many beautiful women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he playfully kneaded her soft boobs, Alexander grinned. "I'm not as bad as you think. I promise I'll marry you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said I'd marry you? Don't get ahead of yourself," Ava retorted, though she was more than satisfied as she nestled into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was utterly exhausted and quickly slipped into sweet dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander lay wide awake, buzzing with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the gem now in his possession, it was time to start etching the magic matrix and prepare to forge the Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quietly slipped out of bed and made his way to the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the corner sat several large boxes containing hundreds of pounds of meteorite. Alexander estimated that if he could find another couple hundred pounds, he'd have enough to refine a substantial amount of meteoric iron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his desk lay a beautiful red gift box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opening it revealed not only the top-tier yellow gemstone but also several decent-quality yellow gemstones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they weren't of the highest grade, they were still first-class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled to himself. "Julia knows how to play her cards right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out Julia had been present when he secured the premium yellow gemstone and had promptly gifted him three additional good-quality yellow gemstones as a peace offering for her son, Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander recognized her attempts to curry favor, but he didn't mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier might be a pain in the ass, but he was capable of change, and Alexander wasn't one to hold grudges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To create a Lightsaber, the energy nexus is crucial. I need to carve an Energy Convergence Matrix on this premium yellow gemstone to harness the energy of the universe as a power source..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he meticulously recalled the methods and details for carving the Energy Convergence Matrix from the Ultimate Legacy, he felt the weight of the task ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't afford to be careless; this was his first attempt at etching a magic circle, and failure would mean destroying the precious yellow gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a top-tier gem wasn't something he could just pick up at any market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calming his racing heart, Alexander took a deep breath to steady himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up the carving knife he had prepared earlier and gently sliced his fingertip, allowing the blood to well up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the knife now coated in his blood, Alexander revolved the Force, focusing it on the blade. He then selected a decent-sized yellow gemstone for the experiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carving an Energy Convergence Matrix was no simple task. Alexander pondered the key elements as he delicately began to etch the patterns into the gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the first </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern emerged, his blood permeated the grooves, emitting a </span><span>faint red glow.</span></p><div class="pagination">
