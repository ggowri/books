  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bronze warrior stomped the ground and unleashed a wild tempest of strikes. Its massive arms moved like lightning, creating a thunderous barrage of golden fists that sealed off the entire corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, Alexander moved like liquid mercury. His body twisted in impossible ways as he wove through the barrage of punches, employing the serpentine movements of the ancient Vardaanian's yoga technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warrior's eyes showed a hint of concern. Suddenly, its punching speed exploded, filling the air with golden fists that cracked like breaking metal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the massive arms caught Alexander square in the chest. Blood sprayed from his mouth as the impact slammed him into the stone floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son of a bitch!" Alexander's mind raced. "This bronze bastard gets stronger the tougher I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As darkness started to cloud his vision, a sudden pulse of golden energy surged from his left chest. An intense wave of heat instantly suppressed his churning internal injuries, leaving his body feeling surprisingly refreshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with this crisis, Alexander's determination hardened into steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He twisted his arms around the bronze warrior's massive limb, using the momentum to spring up from the stone floor. In one fluid motion, he executed the Arhat Hook, unleashing a devastating series of kicks aimed at the warrior's head. Each kick came faster and more ferocious than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing what should have been certain doom, Alexander got an unexpected boost from his golden armor, unleashing a savage counterattack. The bronze warrior couldn't dodge in time and staggered backward from the kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander planted his feet, his stance rock-solid. In one fluid motion, he twisted his body, his spine coiling and uncoiling like a spring. The Force swirled around him like a tornado as he bent like a drawn bow. His fist transformed into a holy weapon, crackling with thunder as he aimed straight for the bronze warrior's waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Muscle-Tendon Classic&mdash;Vajra's Strike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hit connected perfectly with the bronze warrior's midsection. Alexander's technique was flawless&mdash;stick, pull, push and boom! The bronze warrior stumbled back again, swaying like a drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a battle cry that would make your hair stand on end. Golden energy coursed through his chest as the Force spiraled through his entire body. He moved like a snake in the forest, graceful yet deadly, soaring through the air to nail the bronze warrior right in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, those crystal eyes of the bronze warrior actually flickered with rage. It unleashed its Berserk Storm technique, both massive arms becoming a hurricane of strikes against Alexander's approach!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of their exchange echoed like machine gun fire as Alexander and the Bronze Thunder Warrior went blow for blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In those lightning-fast exchanges, Alexander got knocked back spitting blood again and again, but he kept charging forward like a madman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this trial, Alexander had already reached level-two warrior with his Force control. Now that he'd fully stepped into that power, combining all his techniques with his golden armor's boost, he had seemingly endless stamina and life force to draw upon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there like some immortal war god who refused to go down. With each exchange, he only got stronger, the golden energy flowing from his chest growing more intense by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force vortex, supercharged by that endless stream of warm energy, kept getting more and more powerful. His movements became a blur&mdash;faster spins, quicker reflexes. The bronze warrior's hits connected less and less, while Alexander's strikes found their mark more often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to blur...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a grunt as another hit sent him flying. He hit the ground face-first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he'd managed to make the bronze warrior stumble back a few steps too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was feeling the rush of the best fight of his life. He flipped back to his feet like a boss, ready to pounce forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came a sharp crack. Something snapped inside the bronze warrior's head. Those massive arms dropped lifelessly to its sides, and just like that&mdash;it was done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the bronze warrior powered down, Huxley shot Declan a look from deep within the outer courtyard. A smile played across his face as he spoke softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that's what I call natural talent. A true martial arts prodigy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan chanted a quick prayer before speaking, "Ben, go replace the bronze warrior right away. And bring whoever's being tested right now to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What made the bronze warrior as tough as a level-three warrior wasn't just its diamond-hard metal body. The real secret was it had been blessed with sacred energy, giving it a spark of consciousness. That's why only Level Three warriors stood a chance against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it wasn't for the golden energy protecting his chest, Alexander would've been knocked flat on his back ages ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to that mystical armor, though, he had access to what felt like an endless well of strength and stamina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, he couldn't project the Force outward as protective energy, but that golden power boost had pushed him past level-two warrior. That was the only reason he'd managed to go toe-to-toe with the bronze warrior for so long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had turned into a brutal slugfest, draining every last drop of sacred energy from the bronze statue until it finally stopped moving altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan and Huxley, who were running the trials, kept their eyes glued to the bronze warrior. Usually, the statue's power could last for days of testing without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But today, less than two hours in and it was completely drained. Huxley had no clue about the mysterious golden energy on Alexander's chest. As far as he could tell, they had a once-in-a-generation prodigy on their hands&mdash;someone with absolutely insane physical abilities.</span></p><div class="pagination">
