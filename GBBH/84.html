  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whether it was for the Godfather position or due to Guzman's repeated attempts to eliminate him by sending assassins, Alexander couldn't shake off the need to wipe out these threats completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You help me take down Guzman, and I'll fix your son," Alexander said coolly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian paused for a moment, then burst into laughter. "You've got to be kidding me! You think you can take the Godfather's throne? You're not even fit to carry Guzman's shoes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize was taken aback, shocked to learn that Alexander was one of the heirs to the Godfather title.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a flick of his wrist, Sebastian tossed a heavy baton at Alexander's feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Break your own hands. Treat my son. Otherwise, I can't guarantee your family's safety."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Alexander obediently pick up the baton, Sebastian smirked, reveling in the fact that he had intimidated Alexander into submission.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander handed the baton to Charlize. "Here, you take this. Those dozen guys are all yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize gripped the baton tightly, excitement lighting up her face. "Don't worry, boss! I've got this. They won't get within a foot of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander wore a knowing smile, not bothering to elaborate further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four skilled fighters behind Sebastian were no slouches; they were just as formidable as Charlize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you trying to play me for a fool? Hiding behind a woman? Get him! Break his hands first!" Sebastian roared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His henchmen surged forward, like a pack of wolves closing in on their prey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize met them head-on, her smaller frame surprisingly agile and powerful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She moved like a sleek panther among sheep, the baton slicing through the air as she jabbed, swung, and thrust, landing solid hits on their faces, throats, and knees&mdash;vulnerable spots that sent them crashing to the ground. Amidst the chorus of pained cries, Sebastian's men fell one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize took a couple of hits herself, but she cleverly used her hips and thighs to absorb the blows, shifting her weight to deflect the force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though the impacts stung, they didn't hinder her fighting spirit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If anything, the pain fueled her ferocity as she continued to teach her opponents a brutal lesson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, the four skilled fighters behind Sebastian could no longer hold back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The buzz-cut man was the first to leap into action, lunging straight at Charlize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Charlize swung her baton, he didn't flinch; instead, he braced himself with his elbow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The impact felt like hitting a solid oak, and Charlize's instincts kicked in, raising her guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, the other three fighters closed in, their eyes gleaming with malice as they focused on Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, you need to get out of here! I'll hold them off!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize's expression turned serious. She estimated her strength was on par with the buzz-cut guy, but facing four opponents was a different story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even knowing it was a losing battle, she was determined to protect Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander had been holding back, wanting to see how Charlize would handle herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, knowing someone's facade didn't mean knowing their heart. He was pleased with her loyalty, confident that Augusta and the others wouldn't let him down either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The buzz-cut man sneered, saying, "You think you can take us on alone? You're asking for trouble!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He charged forward, throwing a vicious punch at Charlize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the other three darted around her, heading straight for Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize's heart raced as she realized she was pinned down by the buzz-cut. She shouted, "Boss, run! Get out of here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the next moment, a shocking scene unfolded before everyone's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander kicked the first thug charging at him&mdash;a hefty guy&mdash;sending him flying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, with a swift punch, he struck the leaner one in the gut. The lean guy crumpled to the ground, clutching his stomach and curling up like a shrimp, gasping for air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The last skilled fighter gritted his teeth and charged straight at Alexander. In a flash, Alexander ducked low and swept his leg, sending the man crashing to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man with the shaved head tried to break away from Charlize and launch a surprise attack from behind. But Alexander was quicker; he spun around and delivered a swift, precise slap that snapped the man's arm with a sickening crack. With a pained scream, the man was hurled through the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To a true Warrior like Alexander, these so-called experts were no more challenging than toddlers in a kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In no time, Sebastian's elite fighters and proud warriors were all sprawled on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's composure was so flawless that not a strand of his hair was out of place, leaving Charlize in stunned amazement.</p><div class="pagination">
