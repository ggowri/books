  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> roared, "Your father was just an ordinary thug like me back then. Without the financial and human support from the group, would the Lauren family be where it is today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris spat on </span><span>Hoson</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Lauren family has made a lot of contributions to the Brilliant Group, and any favors have been repaid long ago. We have our dignity, and we will never be slaves of the group again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, everything the Lauren family has is earned by our hard work. It has nothing to do with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't regard us as your slaves. You can now join the Lauren family or get out of </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have three minutes to make your choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris pointed at Alexander angrily, and the atmosphere grew tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was furious, but she said nothing because Alexander didn't speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, not taking Kris seriously at all, pulled a cigarette from the cigarette box calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> immediately took out his lighter, but Alexander waved his hand to refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something magical happened. When Alexander put the cigarette in his mouth, it lit up automatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a slow puff and then exhaled a big smoke ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a circle, and then a puff of smoke formed an arrow and passed through the middle of the circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smoke ring stunt was performed in one go and captured everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris sneered contemptuously, "Is it fun? Don't think I will let you off because you put on airs. Once the three minutes are up, I'll show you what fun is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, Alexander still smoked his cigarette at ease, gazing at Kris provocatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris gestured to his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surround them. Don't let them run away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men, ferocious and murderous, rushed forward aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> clenched his fists, his eyes bloodshot, ready to kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany and Rosalia both tried hard to control their anger. Kris was too arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said slowly while smoking, "Don't get mad at such trash. There are still 30 seconds left. I'd like to see what he can do to me when time is up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with his ridicule, Kris became even angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you are so awesome? Let me tell you, this is </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, not the territory of the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Lauren family has formed an alliance with the Morris family. All our wealth and </span><span>territory have been earned by us with our lives. Don't even try to snatch a penny!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode forward, planted his foot on a chair, and glared at Alexander imperiously.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The muscular men in black stood behind him, looking intimidating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all elite members of the Lauren family, including several masters of underground boxing, so Kris was very confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head and muttered to himself, "How greedy! They clearly made their fortune with the help of the group, but they believe they deserve everything..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris slapped the table hard, and several glasses fell to the floor and shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who did you say was greedy? Do you dare to repeat it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained unfazed, but the calmer he was, the more terrifying his pent-up rage grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said you were greedy. Apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at </span><span>Kris,</span><span> his tone extremely icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm dying of laughter. He actually wants me to apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris laughed out loud, as if he had heard the funniest joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A muscular man in black mocked with great disdain, "How dare you ask Mr. Lauren to apologize? We far outnumber you. You must be crazy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a lunatic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who gave you the courage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He dares to put on airs in front of us. Let's destroy him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris' men sneered at Alexander one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even deliberately took out their machetes and weighed them in their hands to frighten him, ready to attack him at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not going to apologize, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed the red cigarette butt in his hand against Kris' face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris' shrill howl startled the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He covered his burning cheek and glared at Alexander, who looked calm.</span></p><div class="pagination">
