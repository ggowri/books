  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't listen to them, Alexander! This shooting challenge is clearly a trap!" Brittany tried to hold him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her a warm smile, touched by her concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael caught that intimate exchange between Alexander and Brittany, and jealousy flared in his chest. "Come on, Alexander, are you man enough to take on our boss or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth, Gael!" Ilona snapped, fixing him with a deadly glare. "Haven't you embarrassed yourself enough already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael shrank back instantly, not daring to say another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I'll take you on," Alexander agreed casually. "That way, you can't claim I was afraid to compete with a woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! This guy's really </span><span>gonna</span><span> try to outshoot our boss? Talk about delusional!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't wait to see him admit defeat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael's group was absolutely convinced of their victory. In their minds, there was no way Alexander stood a chance against Ilona. After all, she was a level-four firearm power metahuman&mdash;one of the top shooters in the entire squad team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Going up against Ilona in a shooting match was like bringing a knife to a gunfight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand dismissively. "Ladies first, Ilona."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona didn't hesitate. She strode over to one of the shooting stations and picked up the pistol, a cold smile playing on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wake up, Alexander. We're in a new era now. People like us, with our special abilities&mdash;we're the future of humanity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She started polishing the gun with deliberate slowness. "No matter how good you are, you're still just an ordinary person. You can't compete with us. There's no way you'll beat me at shooting, so get ready to apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her an icy look and ignored her bragging. He walked over to another empty station and picked up his weapon. It was a new model with an extended magazine that held over twenty rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's the deal, Alexander," Ilona called out, her voice dripping with confidence. "We'll shoot at the </span><span>200 meters</span><span> targets. Empty our magazines completely. Highest score wins. Fair enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't your typical target practice. The range would mix civilian and hostile targets, flashing them randomly like hostages hidden among terrorists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hit a civilian target and they were instantly disqualified. Each hostile target was worth 10 points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just start shooting," Alexander said with a bored expression. "Lady first. Let's skip the talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh!" Ilona felt her blood pressure rising at Alexander's attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't worried, though&mdash;as a level-four metahuman with some serious political backing, she had no problem challenging Alexander right in front of Quentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona was used to people falling all over themselves to impress her. Having someone like Alexander just brush her off was new, and she didn't like it one bit. It was time to teach this guy a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll go first." She smirked. "Don't come crying to me later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona didn't even bother looking at the target before raising her gun and firing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten points!" the range officer called out. The score flashed up on the LCD screen beside them, keeping track of the totals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The targets kept coming, each one designed to push human reflexes to their limits. They were all different. Some were humanoid shapes that overlapped each other, others popped up without warning, and a few showed just tiny bits of the target peeking out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At </span><span>200 meters</span><span> out, most people would barely see a dot, let alone make out the target details. If one had bad eyesight, they wouldn't even know it was there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Quentin and Brittany looked dead serious. Most of these targets seemed practically impossible to hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ilona made it look like child's play. With just a casual pull of the trigger, her bullets curved through the air like they had a mind of their own, knocking down target after target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone else would've lost points by now, but her shots packed some serious punch. Each bullet didn't just take down the targets&mdash;they blasted straight through four feet of reinforced concrete behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone watched with their jaws on the floor as Ilona put on what could only be described as a masterclass in shooting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The targets got trickier the further out they went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were decked out with heavy armor plating that regular bullets couldn't even scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others were hooked up to machines that made them bob and weave like a boxing pro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shooters had to be quick on the trigger. These targets wouldn't stick around for long before they disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ilona was in a league of her own. No matter what they threw at her&mdash;armored targets, ones that moved faster than a jackrabbit, she just kept nailing them one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when they pulled out the super tough setups with multiple targets stacked together, she had all the angles figured out. She could thread her shots to take down two or three targets at once or curve her bullets to hit exactly the target she wanted.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
