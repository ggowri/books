I want to take a look around first. I heard those films were all shot in this building."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander glanced around, curiosity evident on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Norma... I feel like I've heard that name somewhere... Oh, right! She's the leader of the Dragon Gang, isn't she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's whole body shook with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Dragon Gang often appeared in TV news and online stories, and someone had even made a documentary about Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was a top figure in the Walsh family, the head of the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could this be my chance to make my wish come true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's face flushed red with excitement as a deep sense of satisfaction washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop! Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the entrance, Alexander was blocked by a group of fierce-looking security guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked intimidating, their expressions far from welcoming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander asked calmly, "Can't I just go in for a look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The guards burst into mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, here for the actor job? This isn't the way; go around to the other side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One guard pointed the way with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In these parts, men applying for acting roles often faced ridicule and scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin was about to lash out but was stopped by Alexander's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He paid no attention to the guards' attitude and turned to head toward the back of the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boss, why didn't you let me deal with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quiet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander cut him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you know besides fighting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forgive me, Boss. I was wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The normally hot-tempered Marvin lowered his head obediently, admitting his mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith, now even more terrified, stayed silent and followed Alexander obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his cousin's submissive demeanor made him fear Alexander even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The small plaza behind the building was chaotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A large group of men was crowded in line, jostling each other like it was a busy market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were men of all ages&mdash;gray-haired old men, fresh-faced teenagers, and mostly middle-aged men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were at least four or five hundred of them&mdash;tall, short, heavy, thin&mdash;a wide array of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter their age or appearance, they all shared one thing, not a single one had an honest gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some of them could even be described as sleazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their demeanor was sleazy, suggesting they had seen too many questionable films and had skewed minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you shoving? What gives you the right to cut in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop yelling! I was here first, so I'm ahead of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why argue? There are too many people today. The chances of passing the audition are slim. If I can even get a background role, I'll be happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh, I'm getting old. Can you give me a break?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The plaza was a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman in business attire held a megaphone and shouted, "Quiet! Anyone who cuts in line or talks loudly will be kicked out and banned from applying ever again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dozens of security guards stood behind her, maintaining order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After shouting, the woman pulled out a black baton, twirled it, and walked through the crowd, striking anyone who displeased her, making them yelp in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glared at the sleazy men, annoyed. They were of such poor quality that it was impossible to find decent actors&mdash;just trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Alexander approached with Marvin and Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quite the crowd, huh? Packed in like sardines."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was only there to watch the commotion and use the opportunity to discreetly insert Keith into the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nearby, a job notice was posted clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dragon Gang hiring actors! High pay. Requirements as follows..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After reading it, Alexander commanded Keith, "Get in line and join the Dragon Group as my informant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith froze, his face turning red before going pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been here before but failed to pass the first round and was immediately eliminated.</span></p><div class="pagination">
