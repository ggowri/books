  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora couldn't help but start shaking her hips, turning her head to beg, "Please hurry up and come inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled, grabbing a handful of her wet pussy. Then he stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This action left Zora bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you going to do?" Zora asked suspiciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked down at her from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Zora, actually, I have no grudge against you or the Dragon Gang, but your greed has brought this upon you. Look at your current degraded state, haha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered, his contemptuous words and expression instantly shattering Zora's spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out that everything Alexander had done was just to humiliate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two bodyguards who were sprawled on the floor were slowly moving towards the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were very careful, thinking that Alexander didn't notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they got close to the door, the two suddenly jumped up and rushed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't chase after them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, two short, miserable screams came from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora realized that Alexander had arranged for people outside, and the two men were already caught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you want from me?" Zora stammered, much more subdued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "I originally wanted to send you to hell, but I've changed my mind. Since the Dragon Gang and the Sakura Society are not on good terms, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, it would be best if the Dragon Gang joins the Ultimate Alliance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's smile was very gentle, but in Zora's eyes, this was simply the smile of a devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Alexander in disbelief and asked, "You want to annex our Dragon Gang? Are you crazy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smirked, "Hmph. Whether I'm crazy or not, you'll find out soon enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He reached out his hand, pinching Zora's ample chest and injecting a thread of Force into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Throughout the process, Zora didn't dare to move. She didn't understand what he was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said coldly, "From now on, you must obey my commands. If you dare to resist, I guarantee you'll wish you were dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was very much hoping that Alexander would come to have sex with her. As long as Alexander took off his pants, she would open her mouth, swallow Alexander's vulnerable part, and then bite it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No man could withstand such an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, Alexander had just purely humiliated her and had no intention of sleeping with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to pick up the gun not far away and shoot at Alexander again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But thinking of Alexander's skills, she gave up that thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at her with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the villa fell into eerie silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora suddenly felt as if she was being assaulted by countless ants biting and needles piercing her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pain was so intense that she felt like her body was about to be torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What did you do to me? Please spare me," Zora started begging for mercy, unable to bear the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please..." Zora lay naked on the ground, hugging Alexander's feet, begging in extreme pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander kicked her away without any mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He liked beautiful women, and Zora's appearance and body were not bad, but in Alexander's eyes, she was just a piece of trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora was in so much pain that she rolled on the ground and then curled up into a ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her chilling screams were even more terrifying than those in a horror movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander seemed not to see it at all. He took a cigarette from the pack, lit it, and enjoyed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please! I'll do whatever you want. I'm willing to betray the Dragon Gang. Please," Zora begged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She surrendered, just wanting to be free from this terrible pain.</span></p><div class="pagination">
