  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith said awkwardly, "Boss, I'm really sorry! My... my physical condition isn't great. When I came for the interview before, I was eliminated right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander shot him a sharp glare. "Then why were you making a scene in the street, claiming you'd make the top ten actresses bow down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's face turned red, and he didn't dare to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh! I don't think I've seen this handsome guy before. He looks impressive," a fierce woman remarked, eyes lighting up as she spotted Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The formidable woman's eyes sparkled when she saw Alexander, and she jogged over to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her full chest bounced with each step, and the older men watching didn't blink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello, pleased to meet you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman even bowed politely to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at her coldly. "Go ahead, what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men gasped. This was Shirley from the Dragon Gang, in charge of hiring male stars, known for her fierce temper and direct attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one expected Shirley to greet someone first, only for the guy to remain stone-faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley had a ruthless reputation, and countless men had suffered under her baton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh, this pretty boy is doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow, showing attitude to Shirley while applying here? He's definitely getting beaten up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many were eager to see Alexander make a fool of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley's expression shifted several times, but she held back her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She forced a smile and said politely, "Handsome, on behalf of the Dragon Gang, I welcome a man like you. If you meet the physical requirements, you will become a top star!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come, come. This way, please. You don't have to wait in line with the others. Follow me to the front."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley gestured for Alexander to follow her into the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene fell silent. The men waiting in line, anticipating Alexander's downfall, were shocked by what unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley's clear favoritism for him and talk of making him a star felt outrageously unfair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone couldn't help but step forward and demand, "Ms. Shirley, why do we all have to wait in line while he doesn't? Isn't the Dragon Gang known for fairness? Is he someone you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley swung her baton, striking him across the face, making him cry out as he clutched his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She followed up with several more strikes to his head and arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The unlucky man's face was bloodied and bruised, and he groaned in pain, sprawled on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley sneered as she looked around at the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do any of you think you can compare with this gentleman? Look at your sorry selves and then at how handsome and poised he is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're the trash on the ground, then he's the star in the sky! With his looks and charisma, he could be the next superstar of the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You ugly fools make me sick just looking at you. Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley spat on the ground in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men's expressions darkened, too afraid to say anything more. They glared at Alexander with envy and jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but chuckle. Shirley had mistaken him for an applicant, but he was curious to see what she would do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, please follow me," Shirley said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley flashed a brief smile at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had frustrated her earlier, but now she felt she had released that tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she could discover a new superstar for the organization, she'd earn a substantial bonus and a promotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander walked into a corridor with Marvin and Keith beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He planned to discreetly position Keith as an insider within the Dragon Gang before heading to meet Shirley Walsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander whispered, "Keith, you said you didn't meet the physical requirements? What do they test? Running? Sit-ups?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith stammered, "W-well... the first test is about checking the size and length... If it doesn't meet the standard, then it's considered failing the physical requirement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt extremely embarrassed&mdash;no man wanted to admit he was lacking in that department. It was enough to cause insecurity and leave a psychological scar.</span></p><div class="pagination">
