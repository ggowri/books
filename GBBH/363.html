  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's specially selected bodyguards, though strong and skilled fighters, now stood frozen like statues, completely unresponsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hidden in the shadows, Alexander silently approached the mysterious Henry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them, including Henry, noticed that someone else was nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bryant, you are simply captivating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry gave a sly, seductive smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His smile was intensely alluring, holding a strange appeal for Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Cloe felt as though she had never met a man so charming, so handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a quiet scoff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through his eyes, he saw a wisp of dark energy flash across Henry's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was clearly influenced by this dark energy and unconsciously moved closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander suspected, Henry knew corpse-driving sorcery and had other tricks up his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dark energy was powerful, capable of hypnotizing and influencing people's minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Rogers, I think you're quite wonderful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Cloe felt something was off but couldn't quite pinpoint what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry chuckled and said, "Ms. Bryant, I'd like you to stay for dinner. How about a nice chat together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out to wrap his arm around her waist, his intentions crystal clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, something crossed Cloe's mind, and she frowned, stepping back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry's hand landed on empty air, and his expression soured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bryant, are you really going to refuse me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe clutched her forehead, her mind conflicted. One voice urged her to agree, while another reminded her that she belonged to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry chuckled darkly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax, Ms. Bryant. It's just dinner and some conversation, that's all. I'll personally see you home afterward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated further, frowning as she struggled with what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a cold glint flashed across Henry's face as he waved his hand toward Cloe's bodyguards, sending streaks of dark energy into them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards stumbled slightly, then silently turned and walked </span><span>away,</span><span> their movements stiff like poorly oiled robots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Henry dealt with the bodyguards, Alexander felt a chill run down his spine. He could sense the terrifying nature of this dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy must use this dark energy to control corpses; if it could manipulate the dead, it could certainly control the living.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Henry had sent Cloe's bodyguards away and taken control of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took Cloe by the hand and, smiling, led her toward a back room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, his expression cold, followed them, a quiet intent to kill rising within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Treasure Island was his critical base, even his hidden stronghold, and he couldn't allow a corpse-witch like this to remain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following them, he quietly released a stream of the Force, directing it at Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe shuddered and immediately snapped back to her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She yanked her hand from Henry's grip and demanded angrily, "What did you do to me? Are you asking for trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry froze, shocked that his seemingly unstoppable sorcery had failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His handsome face took on a greedy expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You snapped out of it on your own? That's unusual... Do you have some kind of protective charm on you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe tried to turn and run, but Henry slammed her against the wall, pinning her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He revealed his true face, viciously saying, "Ms. Bryant, if I don't help you, the Brilliant Group will lose control of Treasure Island soon, and the Red Umbrella Group will swallow it whole."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling against him, Cloe demanded, "Is it you causing the disappearances at the trading center? The Red Umbrella Group wants you to take us down, don't they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry grinned wickedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Red Umbrella Group offered a billion dollars. I couldn't say no. And long before Guzman arrived on Treasure Island, my family had lived here for centuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> Treasure Island belongs to me, and I'm going to bring down the Brilliant Group and the Red Umbrella Group, too. You're all going to hell!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
