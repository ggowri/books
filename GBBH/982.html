  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, that pill you're using to replenish life force is decent, but you're applying it incorrectly. Mr. Gavin Lawson's injury hasn't healed&mdash;it's actually gotten worse," Alexander stated bluntly, his tone calm but firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words sent a ripple of shock through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bah!" Asher spat, his face contorting with rage. "Alexander, stop spouting nonsense! Everyone here can see that Mr. Gavin Lawson himself said he's fine. Do you take us for fools?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, hand over the formula for your magic powder and leave Loscity, or I swear I'll make you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murderous intent radiated from Asher as he stared Alexander down, his posture coiled and ready for a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The murmurs from the crowd grew louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isn't Mr. Gavin Lawson already healed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher's treatments are usually reliable. Alexander might be bluffing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander's finally met his match&mdash;no one dared to cross him in Loscity, but Asher might just take him down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Encouraged by the crowd's support, Asher straightened his back, his confidence soaring. "Alexander," he taunted loudly, "are you really forcing me to act?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His smug demeanor screamed triumph, as though the entire world bent to his will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just then, Gavin's body gave a violent tremor. He slumped heavily into his chair, his face twisted in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood began trickling from his nostrils and mouth, a horrifying sight that silenced the room in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad! What's happening?!" Ave shouted, rushing to his father's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You were fine just a moment ago!" Gale added, his voice laced with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They turned to Asher, their faces pale with fear and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, didn't you say my grandfather was cured? What's going on?!" Gale demanded, his voice sharp and accusatory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tension in the room skyrocketed. Gavin's personal bodyguards, who had remained quiet until now, stepped forward, their faces dark and filled with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher," one growled, his voice low and threatening, "did you mess up the treatment? If Mr. Gavin Lawson dies because of you, I swear we'll make you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguards closed in, their loyalty to Gavin evident in their deadly glares. It didn't matter who Asher was&mdash;if Gavin's life was lost, their vengeance would know no bounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Calm down!" Asher said, suppressing his growing fear. "Let me examine him again&mdash;there might be another issue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher knelt beside Gavin, his hands trembling slightly as he conducted a quick diagnosis. But as he examined Gavin, his face turned ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This... this doesn't make sense. His injuries shouldn't have worsened. How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cold sweat trickled down his temple. He was at a complete loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I used the finest medicine, combined with advanced techniques," Asher muttered under his breath. "It shouldn't have failed. Why... why is this happening now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Enough excuses!" Grace snapped, her tone ice-cold. "What's happening to my grandfather, Asher? Speak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Asher remained silent, unable to explain the inexplicable. He was already imagining the consequences of failing Gavin: the loss of his reputation, the scorn of the public, and the inevitable backlash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could muster a response, Gavin coughed violently, blood spurting from his mouth before he slumped over, unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Panic broke out in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quick! Call an ambulance!" someone yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Mr. Gavin Lawson dies here, it'll spark a diplomatic nightmare!" another whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amid the chaos, Grace turned and rushed toward Alexander. Her eyes brimmed with desperation as she clasped his arm tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander," she pleaded, her voice trembling, "please&mdash;save my grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight stunned everyone. Grace, always proud and reserved, was now openly begging Alexander for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's face twisted in fury, his jealousy palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, momentarily caught off guard, hesitated before gently patting Grace's back. "Don't worry," he said, his voice steady and reassuring. "I can save Mr. Gavin Lawson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His calm confidence sent murmurs rippling through the crowd once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Does he really think he can do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gavin's condition looks terrible... Can Alexander actually heal him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher, unable to contain his disdain, sneered loudly. "You sound so confident, Alexander. If you fail, everyone here will know you're a fraud."</span></p><div class="pagination">
