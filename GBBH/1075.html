This feels so good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty was sitting on his lap, her tight skirt already discarded. With her long legs parted, she rocked her hips back and forth in a slow, sensual rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't seen each other for some time, and it took only moments for Betty to cum. She was enjoying this happy sex time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still wore a thong, though its thin straps had been pushed aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>could fuck her</span><span> easily, his hands grasping this hot beauty's butt, enjoying the soft, supple feel of her smooth skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was simply enjoying the moment, letting Betty control this sex game. He felt so good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I love you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty cupped Alexander's face with her hands, her eyes gently closed as she softly kissed his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned back in his chair, completely relaxed, while Betty's naked upper body leaned forward slightly. Her long, straight hair cascaded down, shrouding both their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he inhaled the fragrance of her hair, he greedily kissed and bit her big boobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the two were lost in their passion, the phone on the desk began to buzz.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty didn't want to answer it, but Alexander, grinning mischievously, picked it up for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty knew exactly what Alexander meant. He wanted to see her swallow back any sound, afraid to make a noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no choice but to stop moving and answer the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander wasn't about to go easy on her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took the initiative, kissing and touching her body. His legs began to bounce, turning Betty into a daring rider as waves of pleasure surged over her like a relentless tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's lips parted, and she was on the verge of letting out a cry. Panicked, she quickly ended the call and then clasped Alexander's head tightly, pressing his face firmly against her boobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled mischievously, his hands locking around her waist as he began fucking her harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The passion hit Betty like a storm, leaving her body tingling and weak. All she could do was let out soft, helpless whimpers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't say a word, simply accelerating his movements while fervently sucking on her sweet tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could tell how much time had passed when the two finally clung to each other </span><span>tightly, their bodies trembling in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of rest, Alexander gave Betty's hip a playful pat and grinned. "Babe, I just got back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, and you got me to fuck you first, </span><span>haha</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty responded with a seductive smile, snuggling into Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'll always be your woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed herself tightly against Alexander's chest, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat, her happiness and contentment beyond words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Alexander returned home, nearly two hours had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first floor of the villa was brightly lit, glowing with warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently pushed open the door and immediately spotted Ava in the kitchen. She was cooking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Ava was fully focused, her stunning face adorned with a gentle smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her figure was captivating, sexy shape, a slender waist that could be held in one hand, and perfectly rounded hips that added to her allure. Her delicate hands were busy slicing ingredients and preparing a meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew Ava was undoubtedly preparing to welcome him home. A surge of excitement rose in his chest, and for a moment, he felt the warmth of having a true home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled softly to himself. Having a woman like Ava by his side was truly the greatest fortune in life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're back? Hungry? Take a break. Dinner will be ready soon," Ava said, her face lighting up with a joyful smile as she saw Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she was busy, she didn't rush over to hug him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked over to give her a deep kiss before heading to the living room. He turned on the TV, propped his feet up on the coffee table. He relaxed on the sofa, enjoying the TV show happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Ava came out from the kitchen, carrying several dishes with a cheerful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dinner's ready! Come to eat," she called Alexander gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smells amazing! Your cooking skill keeps getting better," Alexander praised sincerely. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's culinary skills had improved to the point where she could easily become a professional chef.</span></p><div class="pagination">
