  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was his imagination or something else, Alexander found Ava even more </span><span>attractive </span><span>than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He admired her, touched her, and found it impossible to describe th</span><span>is amazing</span><span> feeling in words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava noticed Alexander was a bit dazed and saw him staring intently at her breast</span><span>s</span><span>. Feeling both proud and shy, she arched her </span><span>boobs</span><span> a little higher and asked sweetly, "Darling, do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm, I like it a lot... so beautiful..." Alexander grinned mischievously before leaning down to bite </span><span>her nice boobs </span><span>gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava let out a soft </span><span>moan</span><span> and said, "These clothes were all picked out by my mom. You should thank her properly. She even bought a few for herself..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single sentence made Alexander's desire erupt like a volcano, completely uncontrollable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm, don't worry. Right now, all I want is you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hands grabbed hold of her breasts, too full to be contained in one hand. His fingers sank into the soft flesh. It felt utterly amazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava let out a soft </span><span>moan</span><span>, her voice trembling. "I'm so happy</span><span>&hellip; </span><span>I want to give you my all!</span><span> I&rsquo;m yours!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said no more. </span><span>Satisfying her</span><span> was the only wise</span><span> option</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He positioned Ava with her hands braced against the edge of the bathtub, her round hips tilted upward, and moved closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the bathroom was filled with enticing moans...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early the next morning, Alexander arrived at the headquarters of the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Alexander was alone, without Rosalia or Charlize accompanying him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few hours later, the two arrived at the eastern outskirts of </span><span>Newbrook</span><span>, where a sizable company with tight security stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Silver Shield Security, where my dad works! They must be holding him somewhere, but I don't know where." Maxine's voice was filled with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander parked the car in the lot across the street, intending to go in and ask around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me! Release my husband and daughter right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, don't push your luck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Stay</span><span> away from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could reach the company entrance, he saw a middle-aged man in a Silver Shield Security uniform, along with several </span><span>guys</span><span>, surrounding and harassing a middle-aged woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's my mom!" Maxine cried out in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Alexander quickened his pace toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's mother, Emma, looked </span><span>very beautiful and charming. T</span><span>hough she must have been forty, </span><span>people might still think she was just at the age of 30</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma had a graceful, curvaceous figure with long legs, and her eyes held a captivating allure. Obviously, she was a rich lady who was accustomed to luxur</span><span>ies</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom! Mom, I'm here!" Maxine called out excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart? You... you weren't captured?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma glanced in Alexander's direction and immediately spotted her daughter, her face lighting up with surprise and joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her gaze fell on Alexander standing beside her daughter</span><span>. That was </span><span>a handsome young man with refined features, smiling warmly at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma froze for a moment, then quickly grabbed Maxine's hand, asking eagerly, "</span><span>Sweetie</span><span>, is... is this your boyfriend? Did he rescue you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine blushed, hesitating to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man rushed forward and grabbed Emma, growling, "You and your daughter aren't going anywhere, Emma! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You're coming with me to security. We need to have a little chat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sinister grin and predatory gaze made his intentions clear as he stared at Emma's </span><span>big boobs</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lanny, if you lay a finger on my daughter, I'll fight you</span><span> to death</span><span>!" Emma screamed</span><span> and slapped Lanny hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lanny </span><span>nearly fell to the ground because of Emma&rsquo;s</span><span> slap, clutching his stinging cheek as his anger intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've already </span><span>kidnapped </span><span>my husband</span><span>! And you even try to molest me? You monster!</span><span>" Emma shouted. "I will never give in. You just want to steal my husband's </span><span>unique </span><span>technology for free, right? </span><span>Dream on you</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lanny let out an angry snort, </span><span>as this woman&rsquo;s</span><span> humiliation </span><span>to him really pissed him off</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, your husband is </span><span>over!</span><span> He'll have to hand over the technology sooner or later. You and your daughter are </span><span>so beautiful</span><span>. Why not </span><span>stay </span><span>with m</span><span>e</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In your dreams!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's foot shot forward, catching Lanny square in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lanny, caught off guard by Emma and Maxine's ferocity, crumpled to the ground, clutching his stomach in agony. He doubled over, his body contorted in pain.</span></p><div class="pagination">
