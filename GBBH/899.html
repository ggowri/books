Because my ability has reached a certain level, the Ultimate Legacy allows me to fall into a dream and understand the history of the Warriors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a long breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a little uneasy, as he was the last Warrior and didn't want any orc civilizations to exist in the universe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those orcs who possessed terrifying power and were fearless of death were definitely a disaster for mankind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled bitterly and shook his head. The Warriors were almost extinct, and the orcs must be the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he cared about most now was to figure out the conspiracy of the Sakra Society. The monster called living dead always weighed on his heart like a heavy stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what Alexander didn't know was that the Walsh family was in chaos, including Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walsh, we have searched everywhere, but still can't find Ms. Hazel Walsh. What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of subordinates knelt in front of Norma and cautiously reported the progress of their search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel Walsh was Norma's half-sister, and for the first time in her life, she did not come back the entire night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Hazel was only eighteen years old and had just entered </span><span>Kylaville</span><span> University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, even an ordinary family would be highly anxious, let alone she was the second daughter of the Walsh family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew if this wealthy lady was kidnapped by some criminals, or was cheated, or had a car accident or something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can't find Hazel, then it'll be a disgrace to the Dragon Gang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, we must find her even if we have to search all over </span><span>Kylaville</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Walsh family were talking about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone asked angrily, "Is it someone from the Sakra Society kidnapping her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the Sakra Society would dare to kidnap the young lady of the Walsh family, not to mention that the two sides were in an unfriendly and hostile state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, all of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma, who had been silent all this time, shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall fell silent, and dozens of people looked at the new head with different </span><span>expressions and complicated eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a sarcastic voice rang out from among the senior executives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well! You can't even protect your family. You have no ability at all. You got to the top by colluding with outsiders. Do you really think you are the head of the family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone immediately echoed, "Eamonn is right. Not everyone can be the head of the Walsh family. How can you convince others if you can't even protect your sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a group of people started chattering and speaking in sarcastic tones, not giving Norma any face at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma frowned and did not refute it immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn Walsh was Sean's younger brother and had considerable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the last conflict between Norma and Sean, to stabilize the family and not cause panic among family members, Norma did not kill all the members of Sean's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma became the head of the family with the support of Alexander, but she did not kill them all. The remaining force of Sean's was still strong, so Norma's foundation was ultimately unstable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once something happened, these idiots would jump out to make trouble.</span></p><div class="pagination">
