  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily frowned and said, "Forget it, we don't need to contact Cameron. He's definitely not going to show up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head with a slight smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine. One day, they'll realize what they missed. When that happens, I'll be curious to see how regretful they look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dialed Cameron's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello? Who's calling at this time? I'm busy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Cameron, it's Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander? What do you want? Need a favor? I don't have time for that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Cameron, the day after tomorrow is my mom's memorial. I was hoping..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Alexander out, the man on the other end scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I heard you divorced Jane. Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such an idiot! Without the Fairfax family, do you think you'd even have enough to eat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really that dumb? Are you so broke that you're trying to use your mom's memorial to get money from me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, let me make this clear. I don't owe you anything. Don't expect a single penny from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Alexander snapped, "Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cameron, on the other end, screamed back, "Fuck you! You dare yell at me? What does your mom's memorial have to do with me? I'm not going. Your whole </span><span>family's</span><span> useless. Don't ever call me again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call abruptly ended, the hang-up tone ringing in the quiet room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily sighed deeply, her brow furrowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander just chuckled lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just as I thought. From now on, if anything happens to them, it's not my problem. I'll make sure they regret it forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up the phone again and started dialing another relative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After calling every relative he could think of, only Maya agreed to come to the memorial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was kind-hearted but lived far from </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, so they weren't close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hung up the phone with a satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just like you said, Aunt Lily, it's only Aunt Maya who agreed to come. At least it wasn't a total disaster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, thinking Alexander was upset, took his hand and comforted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to feel bad. Maya and I will take care of your mom's grave, and we'll protect it well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart warmed at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for his father's side of the family, he didn't know any of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a relieved sigh. "From now on, aside from you and Aunt Maya, I don't care about anyone else's business. I'm done with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying goodbye to Lily, Alexander returned to the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was at work, and Ashley was at kindergarten. The huge, quiet house made him feel a bit lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he entered the bedroom, he was surprised to find Rosalia and Charlize sitting on the bed, their heads close as they whispered to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia looked up and blushed when she saw him. "Ms. Blackburn told us to stay home and keep you company..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled softly, feeling that Ava truly understood him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had clearly seen that, while Rosalia and Charlize were talking closely, Rosalia's hand had been resting on Charlize's curvy hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both women were blushing, which made him curious. Were they talking about something embarrassing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or maybe these two were bisexual?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, dismissing the thought. He didn't mind at all if women liked other women. It didn't affect him. But he knew most men wouldn't be so open about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Rosalia and Charlize were looking at him expectantly, clearly excited. It had been a while since they'd spent time together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize, with a sultry smile, said, "Mr. Hawthorne, let us take good care of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned, his mood instantly lifting as he admired the two stunning women's seductive figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize began to undress, their bodies with that perfect hourglass shape that could make any man weak in the knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped closer, a mischievous grin on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what were you two talking about while I was gone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia flushed, too embarrassed to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize gave him a knowing look and purred, "We were just planning how to make you feel amazing."</span></p><div class="pagination">
