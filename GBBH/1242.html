  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightsabers flashed through the air as mutant beasts fell one after another, their bodies scattered in pieces across the blood-soaked ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph. Beasts will always be beasts. They'll never surpass humans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a cold sneer. Gripping his saber with both hands, he channeled the Force into the blade and swept it in a wide arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crescent-shaped beam of light tore through the horde of mutants, sending a spray of blood into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alexander took point at the front, bearing the brunt of the assault, William and Logan struggled to keep up from their positions behind him on either side. The sheer number of mutant beasts was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet not a single beast could get within six feet of Alexander&mdash;any that tried were instantly reduced to pieces by his Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed forward relentlessly, not only holding back most of the mutant beasts but also carving a bloody path for William and Logan to follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander closed in on the two mutant apes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They pounced at him simultaneously from both sides, leaping through the air with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mutant monkeys had barely left the ground when Alexander's Lightsabers flashed through the air. A brilliant arc of light sliced through the first monkey, splitting it in two as blood sprayed from the wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one fluid motion, Alexander spun the Lightsabers back, completing a perfect circle that separated another monkey's head from its shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive head rolled across the ground, its dinner plate-sized eyes still glaring with hate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, several mutant wolves lunged forward, launching themselves at William and Logan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William let out a cold laugh as he raised his assault rifle with his left hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The level-four enhanced bullets packed a serious punch, instantly shredding through one wolf's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another wolf charged at William, its massive jaws stretched wide enough to swallow him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William knew he couldn't dodge in time. He had no choice but to brace himself for the hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander appeared like lightning, yanking William aside just as the wolf's fangs snapped shut on empty air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wolf wasn't done yet. The moment its paws hit the ground, it launched itself skyward again, bearing down on William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brilliant flash of steel cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive wolf froze in place, its face twisted in a snarl. It stood paralyzed, as if under a spell, unable to move an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A line of blood appeared across its body and then split open. The wolf's corpse fell to the ground in two clean pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan charged in to face another mutant wolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wielded two machetes, spinning them swiftly. The blades flashed as he split the wolf's head in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third mutant wolf tried to turn tail and run. Logan sprinted after it, his blades becoming a blur of savage strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He severed the wolf's back legs, bringing it down. Before the creature could snap at him, Logan's blade found its mark, cleanly removing the beast's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blink of an eye, the trio led by Alexander had racked up a staggering body count of several hundred mutant beasts. Alexander himself had taken down the majority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been particularly effective against the mutant monkeys, having eliminated half of their pack of fifteen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This group of mutant beasts had broken off from the main horde, numbering over ten thousand strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Augusta and Marvin's teams had already torn through thousands with their heavy firepower. Now, with Alexander taking out half of the mutant monkeys who'd been leading the pack, many of the remaining beasts were left without commanders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three to four thousand mutant beasts fell into chaos and scattered under the intense barrage of gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had once been a sea of over ten thousand beasts had been reduced by two-thirds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander's primary target, the mutant monkey alpha, remained protected in the center of the remaining beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This creature was clearly smarter than the rest, and now that it felt threatened, it was commanding its followers to shield it while slowly retreating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to make a run for it, huh? You clever bastard," Alexander sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered pursuing the monkey alpha to finish it off, but he could see William and Logan were already gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense battle had pushed them to their limits, and the monkey alpha still had three to four thousand mutant beasts protecting it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's thought, Alexander decided against a full pursuit. His people's safety came first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, they'd accomplished their main objective&mdash;the beast tide was rapidly withdrawing from the church area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within minutes, the small church that had been completely surrounded was now clear of any mutant beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All that remained were broken corpses and the ground stained red with beast blood.</span></p><div class="pagination">
