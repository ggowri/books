  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned. "So, how's my cooking? Are you ready to take back what you said and apologize?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles immediately bowed deeply, genuinely amazed. "You're the real deal</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>a true master chef. This spaghetti is absolutely perfect. It's insanely good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was at a loss for words to describe how he felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eh, I guess I really don't know anything..." Dulles sighed deeply, completely humbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Dulles had admitted defeat, Alexander decided it wasn't worth pursuing the matter further and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, wait! What's your secret? Could you teach me how to make spaghetti like this? I'll pay whatever you want. Just name your price!" Dulles begged desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored him. The spaghetti was only this amazing because he'd used the Force. Even if he taught Dulles, the guy couldn't replicate it without the Force abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, Mr. Hawthorne!" Dulles called after him. "I'll do anything, literally anything! Whatever you want, just name it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way!" Alexander snapped, and his voice was icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, he wasn't going after Dulles anymore, but that didn't mean he had to like what </span><span>Dulles had done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Dulles could get another word in, William's hand flew out, landing a solid slap across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles stumbled and hit the ground, clutching his stinging cheek, too stunned to process what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and his crew didn't even spare him a second glance as they walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn..." Dulles muttered, slumping to the ground in defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending William and Logan home, Alexander took Cloe for a drive around the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they cruised down a tree-lined road, his expression suddenly darkened, and his eyes narrowed at something in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up ahead, hidden among the trees, stood a cluster of construction trailers. It was probably where the workers stayed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this hour, with everyone at work, the area was dead quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well. Looks like some unwelcome guests found their way onto Treasure Island," Alexander said with a cold smile, and his eyes glinted dangerously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Alexander knew trouble was brewing, he didn't slow down. Instead, he pressed the gas, speeding straight toward it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they approached the trailers, several cars burst out from hiding. They split into two groups, blocking the road ahead and behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," Alexander said calmly, "I've got you covered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's anxiety melted away as soon as she saw Alexander's confident smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander calmly stepped out of the car, taking Cloe's hand as she followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In seconds, they were surrounded. More than twenty guys jumped out from the cars parked ahead and behind them, closing in like a pack of wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well. Look who's got balls of steel, walking right into our trap without breaking a sweat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy in charge, a thug with a nasty scar across his face, flashed a menacing grin at Alexander. His whole vibe screamed trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sizing Alexander up, he sneered, "I have to admit that I'm a bit confused here. You definitely spotted our setup when you slowed down back there. So, what's the deal? Why walk straight into it? And bringing a lady along? That's either next-level confidence or straight-up stupid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes were pure ice, dripping with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please. If I hadn't shown up, you'd have scattered like rats. Treasure Island's got a few hundred thousand people now. Good luck trying to track you down after that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, and his voice hardened. "So, why don't you cut the crap and tell me who you're working for? Was it Yinson who sent you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha... That's hilarious!" Rico, the scar face, burst out laughing like he'd just heard the joke of the century.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really are something else. Walking right into our trap thinking you're some kind of invincible badass? What an idiot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rico shot Alexander a dismissive look, sizing him up like a predator eyeing its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, we're going to kill you and take control of Treasure Island!" Rico's eyes </span><span>glinted with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you can take over Treasure Island?" Cloe scoffed, looking at them like they were dirt under her shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes lit up with understanding. "So, that's what this is about. You are pirates who've set their sights on my island, huh? You've got some nerve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nerve?" Cloe added with a sneer. "More like a death wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rico's face contorted with rage as he saw how Alexander and Cloe weren't taking them seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and waved his hand. "Do it clean. Break their limbs and tie them up. But keep them alive. We'll use them as bait to ambush the others on the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we've got full control of Treasure Island, then they can die slowly and painfully."</span></p><div class="pagination">
