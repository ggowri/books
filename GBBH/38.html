  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph's right hand throbbed with excruciating pain, and he struggled to catch his breath under Alexander's crushing weight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked up at Alexander with terror in his eyes. He knew this guy wasn't joking around; he was truly capable of murder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"All... all of you... get out... now... "</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph struggled to command his underlings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's foot pressed down harder, making it increasingly difficult for Joseph to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Cripples' men retreated, leaving without a trace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander slowly lifted his right foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph gasped for air, his body drenched in sweat from the ordeal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After catching his breath, he defiantly threatened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You dare cripple my hand? Are you trying to start a war between the Saint Group and The Cripples?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander looked at him with contempt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The fact that you're still breathing is the greatest mercy I'll show you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph was struck speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get on your knees and apologize, then get lost!" Alexander barked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You! Don't push your luck!" Joseph sputtered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander grabbed him by the throat and hoisted him into the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You gonna submit? You gonna kneel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph's face turned even darker from lack of oxygen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyeballs began to bulge as he desperately clawed at Alexander's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... I submit. I'll kneel..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Faced with the threat of death, Joseph finally caved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander flung him aside, his burly frame crumpling to the ground like a sack of trash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Trembling, he got on his knees and stammered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... I apologize. I'm sorry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander waved him off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph scurried away with his lackeys, not even daring to look back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did everyone else snap out of their shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I gotta say, Mr. Hawthorne's got some serious moves. No wonder Ms. Blackburn's taken a shine to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't forget, Joseph trained under Mason, the boxing champ. Mason's known for being overprotective. Think he might step in himself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Big deal! He's just another meathead who knows how to throw a punch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, if the Saint Group's guys hadn't been packing heat, Joseph's crew would've turned that punk into Swiss cheese by now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd buzzed with chatter. Some praised Alexander's skills, others fretted about Mason's potential retaliation, but most still looked down their noses at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In their eyes, no matter how skilled he was, Alexander wasn't part of their elite circle. At best, he was just a capable bodyguard or hired muscle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Ava was utterly astonished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She never imagined Alexander possessed not only miraculous medical skills but also such impressive fighting abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet this guy had endured five whole years of bullying from the Fairfax family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed he was hiding something. She'd have to dig deeper and get to the bottom of this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava mulled over these thoughts, her curiosity piqued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite Godfather's matchmaking intentions, Ava remained reluctant to marry someone she hardly knew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy gushed, tears welling in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you so much, Mr. Hawthorne! From now on, if you tell me to jump, I'll ask how high!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was quite pleased with his attitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come see me tomorrow. I have some business for you to take care of."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, of course! I'll be there bright and early!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy nodded vigorously, like a woodpecker on caffeine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The entire confrontation was captured on camera, with Anne watching intently from the security room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She promptly sent the video to Godfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The silver-haired old man watched the footage, musing to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's definitely my flesh and blood, my good son. To think he managed to lay low in the Fairfax family for five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought he was done for, but he's proven to be quite capable. He's no less impressive than his older brothers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Overcome with emotion, the old man began coughing violently, specks of blood visible in his phlegm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The medical staff, ever-vigilant, rushed to his side...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava cautiously inquired, "If you're so capable, how come you let the Fairfax family push you around before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander scratched his head sheepishly. "Well... I believe in killing them with kindness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava burst into laughter, unable to contain herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shot Alexander a withering glare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't wanna spill, fine. But don't feed me a bunch of bull. You can't keep secrets forever, you know. I'll find out sooner or later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander just chuckled, neither confirming nor denying anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all that drama with the Cripples, the ball was winding down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone started saying their goodbyes to Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar limped over, leaning on his cane, and spoke with a complicated expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, I misjudged you. While you're not quite on par with my grandson, you've got skills of your own, I'll give you that."</p><div class="pagination">
