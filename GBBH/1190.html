  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" As Alexander thrust his cock into Cloe's pussy, she felt as if her body was being </span><span>penetrated. Cloe's brow was furrowed, and her teeth were clenched. She was on the verge of tears as she felt as if her soul was about to fly out of her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two bodies passionately entwined together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander and Cloe returned to the Brilliant Tower, it was already two hours later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William and Logan rushed over with their report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, we caught over a dozen pirates who tried to escape. They won't dare cause trouble again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept his eyes fixed on the small grove across the hillside. "Rico and his men were just pawns. Nobody tries to take Treasure Island without serious backing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa! You're like a mind reader, Alexander. One of the pirates actually confessed they'd been bankrolled by some big shot recently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan let out an impressed whistle, then shot a subtle glance at the grove. Something deadly was lurking there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep in the trees, a few guys in camo gear were having a hushed conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Alexander, huh? Looks pretty average to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever. Just calculate the wind speed and position. Once you're locked in, use the highest-grade armor-piercing rounds. We need to send this guy straight to hell with one shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are Mr. White's orders. We can't screw this up. If we fail, we can kiss that bounty goodbye</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>and that'll be the least of our problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four hitmen split into pairs. Two manned the latest-model sniper rifles and two spotted for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, all four of them had that hungry look in their eyes. Taking out Alexander meant a sweet hundred-million-dollar payday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their leader was a woman in a black mask with eyes that were filled with murder intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Black Widow, top ten on the Dark Web's global hitman rankings. Her body count was triple digits, easy. Her hands were soaked in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the biggest shots</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>politicians or CEOs</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>couldn't dodge her bullets once she had them in her sights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had </span><span>like</span><span> a dozen countries gunning for her, but good luck catching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One time, an entire special forces unit had her team surrounded. But she carved right through them and bounced like it was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was how Black Widow's reputation skyrocketed, eventually landing her a spot among the top ten of the world's deadliest assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But nobody knew that Black Widow was actually a high-ranking veteran of Sakra Society. She was their ace in the hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This four-person hit squad was a force to be reckoned with. Black Widow led the pack, followed by Red Eye as her second, Venom Wolf as third, and Hyena bringing up the rear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If even Mr. White couldn't handle this guy, imagine what it'll mean when we take him down," Black Widow told her team. "We'll get the bounty and rank right below Mr. White himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each member was a lethal force in their own right. Besides Black Widow, the other three could easily rank within the top thirty assassins worldwide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was what made this squad absolutely devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, they came loaded with armor-piercing rounds</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>the heaviest stuff they could get. In their minds, Alexander was as good as dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those pirates got wiped out just like I figured they would," Red Eye said with a cocky grin. "But hey, works for us. Alexander has got to be running on fumes by now. The more worn out he is, the better our chances of putting him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Red Eye didn't know was that taking down Rico and his crew had been about as challenging for Alexander as having breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making out with Cloe, Alexander was definitely at his peak condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We still need to stay sharp. I've studied Alexander. He always finds a way to turn things around when backed into a corner. We can't let our guard down until he's dead," Black Widow warned in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worry too much, Black Widow! He won't be pulling any comebacks with us. I've lost count of how many experts have died by our hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander's just some punk kid. How tough could he really be? Mr. White probably just screwed up," Hyena mocked Yinson. Black Widow was the only one he respected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait? What was that? I swear Alexander just glanced in our direction twice. For real</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>I think he might have spotted us," Venom Wolf said in shock, still peering through his high-powered binoculars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you not get enough sleep last night or something, Venom Wolf? We're half a mile away and hidden in the forest. There's no way he could see us," Red Eye sneered.</span></p><div class="pagination">
