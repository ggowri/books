  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a useless guy who can only rely on women! You can't even dodge this kind of attack!" Owen sneered, watching as his Thunder Explosion engulfed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The look of disdain on his face was unmistakable. He imagined Osborne, charred and defeated, lying helplessly on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic!" Owen scoffed, and the crowd echoed his disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Osborne is the top candidate for the heir; he can't possibly be this weak! He can't even dodge Owen's attack, let alone defend himself? No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowns spread across the faces of the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne wasn't as strong as Owen, he had previously defeated four Yalynch Godsons in public. There had to be something off about this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned toward Osborne as the crackling lightning began to fade, slowly revealing his figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps erupted from the crowd as they stared in disbelief at Osborne, their faces painted with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there, completely unscathed, surrounded by the remnants of Owen's Thunder Explosion. The lightning crackled around him, but it had no effect whatsoever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had taken Owen's full-force attack with nothing but his bare body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a single scorch mark marred his skin, as if Owen's assault had been nothing more than a gentle breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Vincent, who had just lost to Emma, stood there wide-eyed, his heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might have looked down on Owen, but there was no way he could have brushed off a Thunder Explosion like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with full defense, he would have sustained some injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, standing tall and unharmed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was equally stunned, staring at Osborne, who calmly extinguished the remaining sparks of electricity with a casual clap. Fear flickered in Owen's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remarked, a cold smile creeping onto his face, "Owen, it seems you haven't improved at all since our last encounter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad for you, I'm not the same person I used to be! Do you have any stronger moves up your sleeve? If so, now's your chance to show them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's face darkened, and he struggled to find his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged nonchalantly. "Looks like you don't. Well then, let's wrap this up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne tightened his fist and launched a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an incredibly ordinary strike, devoid of any advanced martial art techniques&mdash;just pure, raw power. To a true master, it might even seem laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Owen, that punch was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force surged toward him, growing larger by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He poured every ounce of strength he had into a defense, his cheeks reddening from the effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's fist crashed into Owen's defenses, shattering them instantly. It slammed into Owen's crossed arms, forcing them apart before landing squarely on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was like being hit by a freight train. Owen felt his ribs crack and his insides jolt violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood erupted from his mouth as he was sent flying backward, crashing into the training ground wall with a deafening thud, creating a massive dent before finally coming to a stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence enveloped the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stood in stunned silence, their eyes glued to Osborne, unable to find their voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had indeed claimed he would defeat Owen in one move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had delivered on that promise! Osborne wasn't just boasting or playing mind games; he had absolute confidence in his ability to take Owen down with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling to lift his head, Owen tried to rise, his pride not allowing him to accept defeat so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his body betrayed him; his limbs were numb and weak. After a few unsteady steps, he collapsed again, coughing up more blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair filled his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said flatly, "Owen, you've lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we return to Newport City, you'll spend half a month in the dungeon. As one of the most talented of the younger generation in the Augustine family, your skills no longer match your arrogance. Your overconfidence has clouded your future. Reflect on that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the crowd fell silent again, their eyes fixed on the battered Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists and gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, fine! I admit defeat, and I admit it fully! But this won't be the end! I'll go to the dungeon, and I'll come back stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll challenge you again when I return!" Owen declared before his head lolled to the side, but he lost consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, not taking Owen's words to heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "The gap between us will only widen. Does he want to challenge me again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In dream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next time we meet, Owen might not even have the courage to face me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, an aged voice cut through the murmur of the crowd. "What's all this commotion about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sound of the voice, the crowd's expressions shifted to one of respect as they quickly turned their gaze toward the source.</span></p><div class="pagination">
