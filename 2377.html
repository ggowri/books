  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara achieved a top ten ranking in the state duel, bringing honor to Fantasia Isle. As a reward, Fantasia Isle opened the sect's treasury, allowing Clara to freely choose a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy also made it into the top ten in the state duel, and Azure Haven Academy rewarded her with a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Osborne, he not only claimed a dominant victory in the state duel but also brought unparalleled honor to Mystic Sirius Sect, attracting countless talents and making the sect stronger than ever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Mystic Sirius Sect did not give him any reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not to mention opening the sect's treasury for him to choose a Sacred Artifact, they didn't even bring it up, let alone reward him with a quasi-Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, Osborne didn&rsquo;t feel dissatisfied about this. After all, winning the state </span><span>duel</span><span> championship benefited him the most. Besides, he currently doesn&rsquo;t lack Sacred Artifacts, and ordinary Sacred Artifacts have long lost their appeal to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when compared to Clara and Leroy's situations, Osborne realized the unreliability of Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he quickly adjusted his mindset.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, both of you have already mastered two types of Sacred Artifacts?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara went on, "Although we each have two Sacred Artifacts, we are still weak in zone duel. I hear that there are some very rare talents emerging this time, and their strength is quite amazing. At our level, we are fortunate enough to be able to participate in zone duel, thanks to your help. It's almost impossible to go any further."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy also agreed, "We are well aware of our abilities. The zone duel is more about participation for us. But Osborne, you're different. You're the champion of Zephyr State, so you must aim for a good ranking."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and nodded. "I'll do my best."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Clara and Leroy carefully briefed Osborne on the warriors from other states. This information was hard-earned, gathered through great effort by their sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne showed no interest in it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The warriors they mentioned were indeed extraordinary, possibly even stronger than Agatha and Horace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were Osborne from two months ago, he might have felt pressured facing these people, carefully listened to their introductions, and prepared in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now he doesn't care at all who his opponents are in the zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he understands he shouldn't underestimate his opponents, with his current strength, it's truly hard for anyone below Empyrean Sacredness to catch his interest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, are you even listening seriously?" Clara asked, looking at him in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne snapped back to reality and replied with a smile, "I'm listening! Thank you for the information. With this, I can better determine my next steps. If I achieve good results in the zone duel, part of the credit will go to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two exchanged a glance, looking slightly helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could sense Osborne's perfunctory attitude and indifference, leaving them wondering, "The top warriors from various states we just mentioned, any one of them could pose a threat to Osborne. Why does he seem so unconcerned?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it, just tell me the rules of the zone duel," Osborne changed the subject.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To him, the rules mattered far more than the opponents. With his current strength, the only factor that could stop him from winning the zone duel was the rules.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for any opponent being stronger than him, Osborne simply didn't believe such a person existed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy slowly began, "The rules of the zone duel are actually similar to the state duel; it's a Treasure Hunt!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The entire Eastern Zone 3 includes a total of one hundred states, with each state sending ten participants, making a total of one thousand people in the zone duel! At that time, everyone will enter a mysterious location for the treasure hunt. The specific treasures to be found have not yet been announced. Ultimately, within the set time, the more treasures one finds, the higher their ranking will be."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, during the competition, stealing from each other is allowed! However, this time, no teaming up is permitted, and there won't be a points leaderboard."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After the zone </span><span>duel</span><span> ends, whoever submits the most treasures will be the champion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but raise an eyebrow slightly after hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Treasure hunt? Can such rules really select the strongest contestant? I think luck plays a big part. Plus, those with special abilities who can find treasures more easily clearly have a huge advantage!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such competition rules are quite advantageous for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he has Satan's Eye. When it comes to treasure-hunting ability, he doesn't think he would lose to anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he still found these rules a bit strange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to such rules, the ten selected might not truly be the strongest. For example, an ordinary person, as long as they also have Satan's Eye or similar abilities, combined with enough luck, and their treasures aren't taken by others, could very likely make it into the top ten for the zone duel, or even win the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In comparison, the luck factor in the zone duel is higher than in the state duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy smiled faintly and asked back, "Osborne, why do you assume the purpose of the zone duel is to select the ten strongest people? Maybe the goal of the zone duel is to pick the ten best treasure hunters."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked in confusion, "What do you mean? The zone duel isn't selecting the strongest but the best at treasure hunting?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy nodded. "Exactly! The purpose of this zone duel is to select the ten best treasure hunters! Of course, if you're strong enough, even with poor treasure-hunting skills, you can still advance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, if they can't find treasures, they can always snatch them from others. As long as they're strong enough, they'll find a way to advance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But the true purpose of the zone duel is to select those who are not only strong and capable of surviving in harsh and dangerous environments but also possess excellent treasure-hunting skills."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for why this is..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly lowered her voice and whispered, "I heard that those chosen to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel will be sent by the Glorious Divine Kingdom to explore a highly mysterious place. It holds many treasures, but only those below Empyrean Sacredness can enter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked completely surprised upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly remembered what Angela had said to him before. "Osborne, Ms. Alba told me that the Glorious Divine Kingdom places great importance on this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. After the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, they might make a big move. If you can enter the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, it will be a rare opportunity. You must seize this chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Could the opportunity Ms. Olsen mentioned be referring to exploring that mysterious treasure land?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sense of anticipation suddenly rose in Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This time, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel isn't selecting the strongest individuals but those with the best treasure-hunting abilities. Could it be preparation for the future?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as I can stand out in the zone duel, will the Glorious Divine Kingdom arrange for me to explore some treasure land?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be that place?" Osborne's face changed drastically, and he said in disbelief, "Has Father finally decided to explore that place?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
