  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since it was confirmed that Osborne's Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were with Lionel, Osborne had become worthless in their eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't even be bothered to make a move against Osborne anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, when Osborne quietly left, no one cared, and everyone frantically chased after Lionel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Lionel thought Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge had safely fallen into his Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, all he wanted was to escape from here as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he had no idea that Osborne had already found a hidden safe spot and couldn't help but cast a mocking glance at Lionel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "When Lionel discovers the truth, he might be so angry that he'll cough up blood, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not only did he fail to take my Kingdom Duel Badge, but he also lost the Void Sword, was relentlessly hunted by a group of Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection and Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors, and even got seriously injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I almost feel sorry for him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne spoke, he raised his palm, and a Kingdom Duel Badge appeared in his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number on this Badge clearly displayed over 46 billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's right, this is Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the one Lionel put into the Dimensional Bag wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t real at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was already on guard; he knew Lionel had a scheme and naturally wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t sincerely make a deal with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Kingdom Duel Badge he threw out was real. After all, with his abilities, he couldn't forge one yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Lionel was about to grab Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge, Osborne's Satan's Eye unleashed a powerful ocular energy, instantly enveloping the Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He cleverly swapped his own Badge with another Kingdom Duel Badge he had obtained from someone else. The Kingdom Duel Badge that truly belonged to Osborne had already been quietly retrieved into the Satan Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Kingdom Duel Badge Lionel collected had no Kingdom Duel Scorepoints on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lionel, you want to deceive me? Then I'll pretend to go along with your deal and make you pay a heavy price!" Osborne said with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could imagine, when Lionel barely escaped and eagerly took out the Kingdom Duel Badge from the Dimensional Bag, expecting to see over 46 billion Scorepoints, but found nothing. At that moment, Lionel's expression would surely be priceless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Lionel told others the truth, no one would believe him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone would only think that Lionel kept Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge for himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, everyone's hostility would be directed at Lionel, and they would no longer trouble Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perfect!" Osborne was extremely satisfied with his plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did he successfully toy with Lionel and seize Lionel's Supreme Sacred Artifact, the Void Sword, but he also shifted the trouble onto Lionel, allowing himself to escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, it's time to focus on my own matters! There's still half a year until the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. But within this half year, it's unlikely for my strength to make any significant breakthroughs. At most, after absorbing the Magma Devourer's Marrow Crystal, my body can advance to the advanced Sacredness Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for other aspects, there's basically no room for improvement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just in time to use this period to search for my parents. They were sold as slaves to the Stellar Exploration Organization, Frenetic Storm Warband. Within this half year, I must find the Frenetic Storm Warband and rescue my parents!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne began to move away from the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This path leading to the depths of the universe is still full of dangers for Osborne at this moment. Since no one is chasing him now, it's best for him to stay away from them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign leads to the depths of the universe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe one day, I will also walk this path, venturing deeper into the universe to seek greater power and a higher cultivation level. But for now, in this Stellar Region of the Racial Convergence Planet, I still have too much to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I must find my parents in this life, pay respects to my mother from the past life, clear her name, and avenge her. Also, all the beatings, humiliation, and torment I suffered in my past life&mdash;I will take revenge for all of it. No one can stop me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter who you are now or how powerful you</span><span>'</span><span>ve become, I will find you. Just wait!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A</span><span> cold light flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial said, "Don't forget there's one more thing to do! I mentioned before that I can sense there</span><span>'</span><span>s still an offshoot of the World Tree on the Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Help me destroy it and let me absorb its Tree Heart energy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Don't worry, I haven't forgotten. Once we're strong enough, I'll help you collect the Tree Heart energy from other World Tree offshoots!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was satisfied with this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly changed his appearance, suppressing his aura and power as much as possible, preparing to find a place to return to Racial Convergence Planet to investigate clues about the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, Osborne suddenly felt Satan's Eye start to throb violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a danger warning!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was shocked. His Satan's Eye hadn't issued a danger warning in a long time, but every time it did, it meant danger was imminent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne barely hesitated, quickly took out the Warfare Shield, activated its defensive function, and used the dense Warfare Mist to protect himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he retreated as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, an incredibly terrifying force suddenly descended, instantly striking where he had just stood, completely obliterating it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne retreated in advance; otherwise, such a terrifying force would have torn his body apart instantly. Even though he avoided the center of the attack, the aftermath alone shattered all the surrounding Warfare Mist, and Osborne's body was violently flung away. He clearly heard the sound of his bones breaking and his organs rupturing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cold sweat poured down Osborne's forehead. Ignoring the intense pain, he quickly looked in one direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There, an old man suddenly appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man's eyes were filled with icy killing intent, staring at Osborne as if looking at a dead man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne recognized the old man's identity, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the old man, seeing that he hadn't immediately killed Osborne, showed a hint of surprise on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved his hand, and Osborne instantly felt a thick energy enveloping him, as if a cage had trapped him inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly tried, but found he couldn't leave through interdimensional travel, and his face immediately turned extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm doomed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the old man sneered and said, "Not bad! You actually sensed and dodged my sneak attack in advance. It seems the secrets you carry are far more than I imagined. Unfortunately, you made a fatal mistake, and today will be your end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand over your Kingdom Duel Badge obediently! Surrender all the treasures and secrets you have! Oh, and the Ice Scepter doesn't belong to you. You can return it to me as well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, I can let you die a little easier!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the old man finished speaking, Osborne's expression changed drastically. "Are you from Skyearth Dominion?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man no longer hid it and calmly replied, "That's right! I am the deputy leader of Skyearth Dominion, Aaron Wagner. Brenda is my disciple. The Ice Scepter was a gift from me to her. I thought she would win the championship, but she was suppressed by you and didn't even make it to the top three. What a useless fool."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Still, no matter how useless Brenda is, she is my disciple. You took her Ice Scepter, so you must die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Aaron unleashed overwhelming killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Now, hand it over immediately, and then you can die!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
