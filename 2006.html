  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After God of Light finished speaking, everyone turned to look at Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's expression remained calm as she nodded. "I hope to stop this war, but I know I can't. The only thing I can do is reduce the number of deaths in this conflict and help Celestara regain its order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To me, all races are equal. The Mystic Feather Clan... is just another race enslaved by the Paramount Supreme Clan. When I was born, the Mystic Feather Clan was already under their rule. If I'd been born earlier, I would've fought like the Human Community is doing now to reject slavery!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So now, I will stand with the Human Community! Not just to help them avoid enslavement by Lord Malevolence and the Paramount Supreme Clan, but to defeat them both and liberate all the enslaved races!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Including the Mystic Feather Clan...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this process, the deaths of some from the Mystic Feather Clan will be worth it&mdash;even if I'm the one who has to kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished, Hannah bit her lip, her gaze resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clap, clap, clap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light couldn't help but applaud, her eyes filled with admiration as she looked at Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're remarkable! I've heard that in the East Zone, the Mystic Feather Clan is the only race that has never targeted or looked down on the Human Community. They even go out of their way to help humans! Even among the Dark Deity Legion, their numbers are the smallest, as they refuse to harm humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They only joined the battlefield because of the orders from the Paramount Supreme Clan and Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what happens to Celestara in the future, I promise you that the Mystic Feather Clan will always be friends of the Human Community. Even if they are encountered on the battlefield, unless it's absolutely necessary, I'll make sure they are spared whenever possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After God of Light spoke, Hannah looked at her with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light didn't dwell on the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Osborne and said, "Even if you manage to win the Ascension One Supernal Deity King tournament, it's only three matches. Winning three would already be a huge morale boost for the Human Alliance, but it's still far from the five or six victories you promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to know&mdash;what's your plan to win more? From what I see, all of you are only at the Ascension One Supernal Deity King Level. There aren't any Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings among you, let alone Ascension Three or Four."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's true, we're all only Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings. But as far as I know, the rules allow us to compete in the Ascension Two tournament, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, God of Light froze in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're saying... you want to compete in the Ascension Two tournament?" she asked, shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she furrowed her brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be honest, I don't think this is a good idea. Even though I know you all have the ability to challenge levels above your own and your strength is comparable to Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings, you might even have a good chance of winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the tournament isn't a one-on-one fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ascension Two tournament involves one hundred Supernal Deity Kings on each side. Even if you qualify, it's unlikely you'll be able to turn the tide of the battle. And worse, it could put you in serious danger...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want you to take that kind of risk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head calmly. "I think you misunderstood, God of Light. We're not just planning to enter the Ascension Two tournament. We're entering the Ascension Three and Ascension Four tournaments as well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we're more than 90% confident we can win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light shot to her feet, frowning. "Osborne, as much as I hate to say this, I think you're being overly confident! Even if you are a prodigy&mdash;able to challenge Ascension Two Kings while still at Ascension One&mdash;that kind of talent is already once-in-a-century!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you could manage to fight against Ascension Three Kings, you'd be on par with the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community. I have no doubt your future achievements would surpass mine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Ascension Four...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible! Reaching Ascension Four requires passing the second trial of the Ascension Stairway, along with an enormous energy feedback that significantly boosts their strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The gap between Ascension Three and Ascension Four is enormous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No Ascension One Supernal Deity King could ever compare to an Ascension Four King. It has nothing to do with talent&mdash;no amount of talent can bridge that gap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if you enter the Ascension Four tournament, it's as good as a death sentence. Forget changing the outcome of the war&mdash;you'll have no chance of winning and will only end up dead on the battlefield."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light's face was deeply serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she wasn't accusing Osborne of arrogance or overconfidence&mdash;she was genuinely trying to dissuade him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "You're right, God of Light. Normally, an Ascension One Supernal Deity King would never stand a chance against an Ascension Four King&mdash;the gap is just too wide. Even I don't have absolute confidence...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what if the situation isn't normal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light froze. "Not normal? What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "It's too complicated to explain. God of Light, why don't you bring out a few Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings to spar with us? Once the sparring is over, you'll understand what I mean."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light stared at Osborne, her mouth slightly open in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "No amount of explanation can compare to a single real fight, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light's expression shifted unpredictably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she gritted her teeth and said, "Fine! Since you're so insistent, I'll grant your request. This will let you experience the power of Ascension Four Kings firsthand&mdash;and hopefully put an end to this reckless idea of yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, God of Light clapped her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, eight figures entered the grand hall, bowing respectfully to God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, you summoned us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light nodded and gestured toward Osborne. "These are the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community, the most outstanding rising stars among humans. They would like to spar with you, so please offer them some guidance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight immediately nodded in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, they turned their attention to Osborne and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sized them up as well. They were all Radiant Guardians, each one an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, radiating an overwhelming presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, these eight participated in the Ascension Four tournament two days ago... and they all lost. They didn't even come close to winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't even handle them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light didn't finish her sentence, but the meaning was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne couldn't even beat these eight, then he had no business competing in the Ascension Four tournament&mdash;it simply wasn't realistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne simply smiled and nodded. "Don't worry. If we can't handle them, I'll accept it and give up on the Ascension Four tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's begin!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
