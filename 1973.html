  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was the one sent crashing back, propelled by the colossal force of the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flew nearly 60 miles before managing to steady himself, yet he emerged unharmed, his expression composed as he stared at Bram from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level Nine lightning elemental essence combined with the Bloodwrought Bow to create a lightning arrow... It has power, sure, but it doesn't quite match that of an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King. I suppose my level is still a bit too low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But my Infinite Sacred Body is strong enough that even an Ascension Four attack shouldn't easily break through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can hold my ground for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark of determination flickered in his eyes as he sized up Bram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Bram, although in a favorable position, wore a grim look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already used about eighty percent of his strength, and he had expected to at least leave Osborne severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Bram had merely sent him flying without causing any real damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a bitter pill to swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Hudson family is hiding a monster like him! Icy Nine had me go after one of the Seven Young Deity Kings from the Human Community&mdash;Theodore&mdash;thinking he would be the threat. Little did they know, this guy is far more terrifying than Theodore! He has to be dealt with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A more intense murderous intent flared in Bram's eyes. "You've got some good strength, but that won't save you! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram shouted as he unleashed his full power once more, unleashing a volley of icy arrows that showered down on Osborne like a torrential rain. Each arrow carried with it a terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed, "You think you can kill me? You're not even close!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne counterattacked, channeling thunderous energy into his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunderous arrows shot forth, striking down Bram's icy projectiles one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his lightning arrows were getting knocked aside, Bram would never manage to land a hit on him&mdash;not even a scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram's scowl deepened. "Damn it! If it weren't for Jethro's self-destruction injuring me and weakening my state, I wouldn't be struggling against some brat like you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll have to pull out my trump card!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Ascendance Technique: Absolute Zero!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A resonant hum filled the air as Bram unleashed his Divine Ascendance Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the shift immediately; it was as though everything in hundreds of miles had ground to a halt. An overwhelming wave of chilling power blanketed him, freezing even the lightning arrows he had just shot into mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thick layers of ice quickly formed around the Bloodwrought Bow, trapping it in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold winds howled around Osborne, biting at his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his Infinite Sacred Body, he could feel the frigid grip of Bram's Divine Ascendance Technique seep in, drawing blood and leaving crimson trails across his flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furrowing his brow, Osborne thought, "So this is the true combat power of an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King? Looks like I'll need to unleash my real tricks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined exhale, he summoned a powerful force from within him, shattering the layers of ice encasing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got your Divine Ascendance Technique, but I've got mine! Multi-thunder Chainstorm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swing of his hand, a deluge of lightning erupted, enveloping Bram in a tempest of electric fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vicious lightning snakes descended from the sky, aimed directly at Bram's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram merely sneered, refusing to back down. Instead, he summoned his divine power to create a protective barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The electric serpents struck his divine shield, causing ripples of energy to pulse outward, yet they failed to pierce through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As more bolts of lightning fell like hellish rain, they all collided harmlessly against Bram's defenses, unable to inflict any harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram couldn't help but sneer, saying, "Nice attack, but it's not going to cut it! Your strength seems to be a notch above Jethro's, but let's be real... You're barely at the level of an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King. I, on the other hand, am an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't stand a chance! You might as well join Jethro in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot back with a cold smile, "Is that so? Well, let's see how you handle this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Ascendance Technique: Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous roar, countless Shadow Drakes erupted from Osborne, surging toward Bram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silent roars of the drakes sent a shiver down Bram's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dark power?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram realized the gravity of the situation and quickly raised his divine power for defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Shadow Drakes crashed into his barrier, unleashing a violent explosion that sent Bram hurtling backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer could he afford to take Osborne's attacks head-on; he dodged swiftly, evading the onslaught. The Shadow Drakes were powerful but notoriously slow, a weakness Bram was quick to exploit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he didn't let his guard down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more Shadow Drakes charged at him, while he was still trapped in the Multi-thunder Chainstorm, unable to escape. With each passing moment, the number of drakes increased, and he knew it was only a matter of time before he couldn't evade them any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Not only do you wield Thunder Power, but you've got dark power too! And it looks like your dark power is even stronger than your Thunder Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you have both Thunder and dark power like 'Theodore', the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?" Bram demanded, his voice laced with incredulity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged off the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll find out once you're dead. Until then, I'm not spilling any secrets!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram's anger boiled over. "You're asking for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can take me down like this? Dream on! Let's see if you can kill me before I finish you off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram's Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Absolute Zero&mdash;continued to unleash its devastating power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his control, the intensity grew, and the howling cold winds became sharper than blades. Blood began to seep from Osborne's wounds, staining his body crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the untrained eye, it looked like Osborne was in dire straits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But only he knew that his Infinite Sacred Body was absorbing most of the icy onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injuries he sustained were merely superficial, hardly worth using the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two warriors exchanged blows, neither able to gain the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally understood why the Eighth World Tree offshoot had been locked in a stalemate with the Creation Herald for three hundred years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When two evenly matched opponents faced off, it was incredibly difficult to determine a victor. The battle often devolved into a war of attrition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was exactly where he and Bram found themselves&mdash;locked in a contest of endurance, each testing the other's limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, it appeared that Osborne was in a precarious position, having sustained injuries, while Bram, though disheveled, seemed completely unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the reality was quite the opposite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew in his heart that he had already won!</span></p><div class="pagination">
