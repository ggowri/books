  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the Wooden Golem's eyes flashed with a fierce </span><span>glint,</span><span> it zeroed in on Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Bryce didn't feel any immediate threat and stood his ground, cool as a cucumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Golem's energy signature started to change and finally settled at Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox quickly said, "The Wooden Golem scans its opponent's energy signature to figure out their cultivation level, and then it automatically adjusts its own power to match. Since Bryce is a Supernal Deity King at Ascension Three, the Golem will only use power equivalent to that stage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So as long as Bryce can beat the Golem, he'll pass the practical assessment. After that, he'll become an inner disciple of Peak Seven, and no one will dare to object."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement. "This Golem does seem to have a pretty potent energy signature."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox frowned, feeling the gravity of the situation. "Yeah, and there's something fishy about this Wooden Golem. Its power seems way stronger than normal. But it was made by Ms. Olsen, and it was indeed at Ascension Three...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrance better not pull any stunts!" Maddox threw a look in Terrance's and his gang's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance just sneered, his calmness oozing self-assurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he met Maddox's gaze, he let out a disdainful scoff. Maddox huffed and looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this show on the road!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Wooden Golem sprang to life, Bryce waved his hand casually, still looking as laid-back as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening noise, the Golem charged at Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, it moved a bit clumsily, but in no time, it was as swift and nimble as a real living being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Wooden Golem was right in front of Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its huge fist gathered power as it swung towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here it goes! Here it goes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd around them went wild with excitement. "How long do you think he can stay in the fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! I bet he'll last a minute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A minute? You're really overestimating him. This Golem was personally made by Ms. Olsen. Word has it that it's insanely powerful. If we had to take this practical exam again, most of us would have a hard time against these Golems!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I give him thirty seconds, max!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty seconds? That's being kind. He's just a hick from some small life-bearing planet. He thinks he's something special, but when it comes to facing a Wooden Golem made by Ms. Olsen, lasting thirty seconds would be a major achievement!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I doubt he'll even survive one punch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid all the noisy chatter, Bryce remained cool as a cucumber. As he felt the Golem's attack and sized up its power, he couldn't help but be taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Golem is really something!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it this fast? It's incredibly powerful, even stronger than some of the prodigies from the Paramount Supreme Clan. Those prodigies wouldn't stand a chance against these Wooden Golems at the same cultivation level. They'd be knocked out in an instant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Interesting, but it's no challenge! You think this Wooden Golem can stop me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Fat chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in his head, Bryce launched his counter-attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of dodging or backing off, he balled his fist and threw a thunderous punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful wave of energy burst out, shattering the Golem's attack and sending it flying back with a huge force. It crashed into the edge of the arena. Its eyes flickered weakly as it crumpled to the ground, barely able to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deathly hush fell over the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a moment ago, the spectators had been all fired up, arguing about how long Bryce could hold out against the Golem. Now, everyone's eyes were wide open, in disbelief at what they'd just seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce had sent a Wooden Golem of the same cultivation level flying with a single punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How's that even possible? How can a Wooden Golem be this useless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was charged, and the crowd exploded into a chaotic hubbub.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People were raising their voices as they argued about what had just transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did the Wooden Golem break down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wouldn't put it past it! Those Golems haven't been used in forever. Maybe there really is something wrong with it. How else could that guy knock it out with one punch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously, who could pull that off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Definitely not me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be a glitch with the Golem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, Terrance and his gang exchanged nervous looks. When Bryce sent the Wooden Golem flying with a single punch, they all jumped to their feet, their faces showing utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance whirled around to </span><span>Jamaal,</span><span> his voice sharp. "What's going on? Did you pick a defective Golem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamaal looked totally confused. "Terrance, it's not my fault! Your teacher personally gave this Golem to me. He tested it himself. There's no way it's broken!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance's face clouded over, with barely-contained rage boiling inside him. "Then how the hell did it get taken out with one punch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This was supposed to be the toughest batch of Wooden Golems! Even you and I would have a hard time beating it at the same level. If there's nothing wrong with it, how could that kid knock it down with one strike?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamaal was at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead sure the Wooden Golem was working fine, which made him come to one realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't the Golem that was the issue; it was Bryce's insane strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamaal shook his head, not wanting to believe the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "Maybe it was just a lucky shot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go check it out right away! Next time, there won't be a screw-up like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Jamaal rushed onto the arena, eager to take a look at the Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Bryce just shrugged. "Is this really all the Peak Seven practical assessment has in store? This Golem's not impressive at all. What a letdown..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Terrance, a sneering grin spreading across his face. "So, does that mean I've passed the practical assessment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance's face turned as gloomy as a brewing storm, with a glare full of pure hatred burning in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You think some low-level Ascension Three punk can take me on? Just you wait! I'll find the right time to make you regret this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Passed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much Terrance wished he could deny it, Bryce had beaten the Wooden Golem of the same cultivation level. He had no more excuses to give Bryce a hard time and had to announce the result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Terrance shot a look at Osborne and the others standing nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! That was just a stroke of luck. The rest of you will have a much harder time getting through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamaal came back and confirmed that there was nothing wrong with the Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next one!" Terrance said icily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me give it a go! I'm the weakest!" Diana piped up with a smile and walked towards the arena, letting the Wooden Golem scan her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the Golem lunged forward. It carried a force much like before, but this time it was even swifter and more powerful, like a wildfire spreading faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Diana stayed as cool as a cucumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gentle yellow glow wrapped around her. It was the essence of the earth elemental, oozing strength. It made her small frame look like a colossal golden-lit warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Golem struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana didn't flinch or fight back. It was as if she wanted to feel the Golem's power for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a thunderous thud, the Golem hit Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yellow energy around her just gave a soft flicker, barely moving, and then steadied itself again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great hit!" Diana said with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in a sudden burst of power, the yellow force flared up and sent the Golem flying backward. It smashed into the edge of the stage and didn't get up right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stood there, a clear winner!</span></p><div class="pagination">
