  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face grew stern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Class A martial master and a dozen Class A- martial artists&mdash;such a force could decimate an ordinary ancient family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they had one goal&mdash;to kill Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after dispatching four Class A- masters with a single punch, Osborne remained vigilant. But fear was absent; instead, a fierce battle lust filled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Defeat you all, and I'll uncover who in Dampston is in league with the Aberrants. So, let battle commence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body shook violently as a blood-red martial art aura enveloped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he exchanged blows with Victor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor, a Class A martial master for over two decades, was far stronger than Brad. Yet, after just one punch against Osborne, he was sent flying, spewing blood, his martial art aura wavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, as he was hurled away, the dozen Class A- masters attacked, momentarily halting Osborne and preventing a follow-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Class A- powerhouses assaulted Osborne with a flurry of techniques. Though they couldn't penetrate his martial art aura, they managed to create ripples, effectively constraining his offense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onslaught trapped Osborne like a bog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Victor charged back in. His martial art aura blazed anew, unleashing an even mightier force as he struck Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne staggered and was knocked back several steps. A section of his martial art aura shattered, and the immense impact inflicted a minor injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spiral Force again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne touched his chest, his body channeling energy to heal swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Spiral Force is stronger than Brad's. But you're far from Isa's level. As for my mastery of Spiral Force, it's on par with his!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne launched another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He withstood the onslaught of a dozen Class A- masters and launched another punch at Victor, clashing with his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor was sent flying once more, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, his expression one of utter shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this contest of strength, he was utterly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it not been for the support of the other Class A- martial artists, constantly pressuring Osborne and preventing him from focusing solely on Victor, the latter might have been severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear rose in Victor's heart. His will to fight was dissipating rapidly, replaced by the thought of retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the support of a dozen Class A- martial artists, Victor was no match for him, able only to momentarily hold him off, with no hope of defeating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Osborne had cultivated both martial arts and metahuman powers, mastering the elusive space elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in defeat, Osborne could tear open a dimensional rift and escape instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't handle this man! He must be a high-ranking member of the Draco Group. If I stay and continue to fight, I'm the one who will end up dead! I'm from the Paltrow family. I'm only here to assist the Aberrants' operation. I don't need to risk my life! Since I'm no match for him, I'll retreat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having made up his mind, Victor suddenly turned to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His action caused the faces of the dozen Class A- masters, who were still trying to coordinate their attacks on Osborne, to pale in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, he's running!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he escapes, we won't stand a chance against this man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's run too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, the Class A- martial artists also fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne sneered, "Only now do you think of escape? It's too late! Since you've shown yourselves, you all stay here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he no longer concealed his true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shape-shifting to Vampire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying power erupted within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hair began to grow wildly, swiftly turning into a head of flowing blood-red locks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne struck with a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, several fleeing Class A- martial artists were struck into the sea by Osborne, spitting out blood, severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could react, Osborne's blood-red hair instantly coiled around them, piercing their bodies and rendering them unable to exert their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror and despair filled their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne showed no mercy, casually tearing open a dimensional rift and stepping through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, he appeared behind a few others who were fleeing in a different direction, delivering another crushing punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Already gravely injured, they could not withstand Osborne's overwhelming force. The reason they weren't killed was that Osborne did not wish to kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's blood-red hair coiled around them as well, suppressing their powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tore open dimensional rifts continuously, moving as if teleporting to chase down the fleeing Class A- fighters, injuring them one by one and binding them with his hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood in the air, his red hair like vines stretching hundreds of feet, drifting in the void, with the tips binding a dozen severely injured Class A- fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight was both awe-inspiring and horrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor, who had fled to a distance, couldn't help but look back. The sight turned his face pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! Run for your life!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
