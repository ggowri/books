  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a confident grin plastered across his face, Guy reveled in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For him, deciding to ambush Osborne was merely a tactic to ensure a swift and uncomplicated resolution, not a reflection of any doubt regarding his ability to overpower Osborne in a direct confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his eyes, Osborne was just a newly minted Celestial Deity. Despite the fact that Osborne had toyed with the likes of Fabian, the Deity Overlord, and had taken down peak Celestial Deities like Kerwin, Guy dismissed him as a trivial threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This will be a walk in the park," he thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the powerful divine power shield he had set up, Guy felt invincible; even he would struggle to break through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne has nowhere to run! In this cramped mine, he can't utilize his speed. What kind of tricks can he pull now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's confidence swelled as he crushed the key to the divine power shield in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! With the key destroyed, not even I can deactivate this shield. We're stuck here until its energy runs out&mdash;at least half an hour! So don't even think about getting the key from me and making a getaway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne regarded him with a bemused expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guy, have you ever heard the saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's disdainful smile widened. "Pride comes before a fall!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You actually destroyed the key to the divine power shield? Aren't you worried that when you want to escape, you'll be trapped by it? You might just regret that decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, Guy was taken aback; then he burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! Osborne, you're a riot! But why would I need to run?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think a freshly minted Celestial Deity like you could force me to flee? Even if you're a prodigy of the Upper Race, you're no match for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The only one who will be running is you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a sneer, he continued, "So, how do you want to die? If you hand over what you took from the ancient god's treasury, I might make it quick and painless. Otherwise, I'll take my time torturing you until you wish for death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he approached Osborne, the overwhelming presence of a Deity Overlord bore down on him like a mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, Osborne seemed unfazed, still wearing that calm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guy, you're overestimating yourself! I wouldn't have stayed if I didn't have a plan. You think I'm just bluffing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's confidence wavered for a moment, but he quickly regained his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You might know someone's hiding, but you never guessed it was me! You're just pretending to be composed! Your misplaced confidence is going to be your downfall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head, a knowing look in his eyes. "No, it's your arrogance that's going to seal your fate! Had you not destroyed the key to the divine power shield, you might've had a sliver of hope to escape. But now? You've got nothing! So, let's get this party started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne unleashed his divine power, enveloping himself in a radiant aura. The intensity of his energy was surprisingly on par with Guy's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's expression hardened, his confidence faltering for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced up at Osborne. Noting the five flickering Divine Flames above his head, Guy let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Humph! Your talent is impressive indeed! It's no wonder Laird, a man so proud, wanted to recruit you. Too bad you don't recognize the opportunity you've been given! You've just recently broken through to Celestial Deity and possess such power. There are so few super talents like you in the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Or perhaps you've stumbled upon some great fortune from the ancient god's treasury?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's face lit up with excitement as he spoke, the prospect of stealing Osborne's potential thrilling him to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once I kill you, all your fortunes will be mine! So, you might as well prepare for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Guy unleashed his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The divine power of the Deity Overlord surged with ferocity, crashing down like a raging tide or molten lava into the narrow confines of the mine, barreling toward Osborne with relentless force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This kind of attack would be enough to overwhelm ninety-nine percent of peak Celestial Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But sadly for Guy, he was up against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without skipping a beat, Osborne retaliated. "Judgment Thunder Drake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crackling bolts of lightning erupted, coalescing into a massive thunder dragon that surged down the mine to meet Guy's onslaught head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The powerful thunder dragon roared as it clashed with Guy's energy, resulting in a cataclysmic explosion in the center of the tunnel. The shockwave radiated outward like a horde of high-explosive bombs going off, shattering both attacks and creating a colossal wave of force that swept toward Osborne and Guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire mine trembled with the impact, yet both Osborne and Guy stood their ground, unmoving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, shock washed over Guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? You actually blocked my attack? How is that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can't be a Celestial Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you... a Deity Overlord?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
