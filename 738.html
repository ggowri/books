  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Emma insist on staying, James appeared a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't say much. He chose not to expose Emma's true intentions, as he didn't want anyone to know about the nature of their relationship just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, James could only leave with the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Dalton also left with the unconscious Owen. Before departing, he shot Osborne a cold glance and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I hope that during your Honor Quest Ceremony, you can be as formidable as you were when you defeated Owen! Don't let your ceremony become the Augustine family's disgrace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Dalton. No matter how weak I am, I won't be defeated in a single move like Owen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he deliberately glanced at Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Osborne mock Owen, Dalton's face immediately darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted but didn't say more, quickly leaving with a huff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb shook his head and sighed as he watched Dalton and Owen's figures fade away. "Osborne, don't take it to heart. Dalton and Owen aren't bad at heart; they're just overly competitive, but their strength doesn't match their ambition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied calmly, "I'm not angry, Caleb. But when someone mocks me, I have to strike back a little, don't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb patted Osborne on the shoulder and decided not to dwell on the topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your plan now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, thinking about his next steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His immediate plan was to take Anastasia to Godfather's medical research institute. The institute now belonged to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne intended to have Anastasia receive treatment there and then take over the nine training bases, incorporating all the trainees into the Blood Demon Organization to strengthen its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, he needed to focus on enhancing his own strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month might seem like a long time, but it would pass in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to make every second count to improve his abilities, aiming to at least reach Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that even Class AAA might not be enough to achieve a perfect performance in the Honor Quest Ceremony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt immense pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caleb, I plan to return to Newport City's Augustine family estate to concentrate on my training and improve my skills," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb nodded. "You're only at Class AA right now, and you just broke through not long ago. You do need to work on enhancing your abilities. However, pure training may not be the most effective way to grow stronger; experiencing more battles is key."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, seeming hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caleb, do you have something to say? Please, speak freely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb gave a wry smile. "Osborne, would you be interested in attending someone else's Honor Quest Ceremony? Even if you don't participate in any challenges, just being there to observe could be beneficial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, your Honor Quest Ceremony is only a month away. You don't know much about the ceremony yet. If you could attend one yourself, you might gain a deeper understanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caleb, is there another Honor Quest Ceremony happening soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb nodded. "Yes, in recent years, there have been fewer Honor Quest Ceremonies, but there are still at least seven or eight each year. In seven days, the Williamson family of Tethynia will hold an Honor Quest Ceremony for their heir, Cuthbert Williamson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Williamson family is Tethynia's Divine Family and the royal family there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their status in Tethynia is even higher than our family's status in Rosmandi. It's said that when Cuthbert was born, there was a celestial phenomenon. The earth split open, and a divine artifact emerged, merging into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He broke through to Class AAA at the age of 28. Now he's 36 and has nearly reached the peak of Class AAA, ready to break into Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why the Williamson family is hosting this Honor Quest Ceremony for him&mdash;hoping that intense battles will give him the insight he needs to find a breakthrough to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Williamson family has sent invitations to all the major powers worldwide. The world's top young warriors will be attending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tethynia is one of the strongholds of the Aberrants, so initially, we didn't plan to send anyone. Given our enmity with the Aberrants, it's too dangerous for our people to go to Tethynia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Caleb hesitated again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I believe that, with your Honor Quest Ceremony only a month away, attending this one could be more beneficial to you than just training alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Caleb spoke, Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tethynia? The Williamson family? The stronghold of the Aberrants? An Honor Quest Ceremony in seven days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caleb, I want to go to Tethynia and attend the Williamson family's Honor Quest Ceremony! As long as I disguise myself and assume a different identity, there shouldn't be much danger, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew you'd want to go. Leave it to me. I'll help you prepare a new identity!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
