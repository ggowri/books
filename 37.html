  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not long after, Osborne finally safely returned to Isa&rsquo;s Institute of Human Research.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Throughout the journey, Osborne had a vague sense that something was amiss as if he was being watched, yet he encountered no incidents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It wasn&rsquo;t until he returned here that he felt relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Maybe I was mistaken,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne quickly found Isa and handed over the two longevity herbs to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Well done, two longevity herbs,&rdquo; Isa said. &ldquo;These are enough to extend Anastasia&rsquo;s life for a year. To completely cure her, you&rsquo;ll have to diligently complete the heir&rsquo;s tests and elevate your permissions.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With the task of prolonging Anastasia&rsquo;s life accomplished, he now needed to figure out how to tackle the second part of the current test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This second test required him to get close to Clarissa and stay by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Up to this point, Osborne was still clueless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Go rest for now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here with Anastasia.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa nodded and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Approaching his sister, Osborne gently smoothed her disheveled hair and whispered tenderly, &ldquo;I will cure you. No matter the cost, I will ensure you live like a normal girl. And, I found a relative, my grandfather, a significant figure. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&lsquo;Once you&rsquo;re better, perhaps I&rsquo;ll become a big shot, too. Then, I&rsquo;ll take you out for the best food and drinks. How does that sound?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He smiled down at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No more hardships for us. I will become the new Godfather, and I&rsquo;ll make you my happiest sister. I promise, Anastasia&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After his gentle words, Osborne finally settled back in a corner, beginning his practice of The Breath of Celestial, a technique to enhance physical attributes rapidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the night grew deeper and the surroundings fell into silence, Osborne suddenly jolted, his Satan&rsquo;s Eye sensing danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This ability had saved him numerous times in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a grave expression, Osborne stood up, his gaze fixed on the door of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, a knock echoed outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Glancing at the time, Osborne realized it was 5 a.m.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Who would be knocking at this hour?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he asked softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A middle-aged woman&rsquo;s voice replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne recognized it as the cleaning lady&rsquo;s voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Cleaning so early?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne furrowed his brow, hesitant to immediately open the door due to a lingering sense of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Drawing the Draco Model H mini-handgun from its holster, he cautiously approached the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Outside the ward, Milo smirked coldly, his eyes fixated on the peephole.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A strange purple light emitted from his eyes, appearing eerie and terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Come on</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">c</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ome on</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> Milo thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once you bring your eyes close or meet mine through the door, you&rsquo;ll be under my control.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Then, you&rsquo;ll be my sacrificial lamb.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Come quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Milo waited silently, surrounded by extreme quietness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet, as seconds passed, Osborne&rsquo;s footsteps remained halted behind the door. He neither opened it nor peered through the peephole.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unable to contain his impatience, Milo furrowed his brow tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a moment of contemplation, he placed his palm on the door handle and twisted it gently, causing the alloy handle to distort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, the door lock was broken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Milo swiftly pushed open the door, only to be greeted by a dark barrel of a gun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A faint gunshot echoed as the Draco Model H mini-handgun fired, its specialized bullets ten times smaller than normal, hurtling towards Milo&rsquo;s eye at a terrifying speed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; Osborne snarled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing the knocking, Osborne instinctively thought to check outside through the peephole. But then he remembered that his Satan&rsquo;s Eye had ascended to level two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the second level, his Satan&rsquo;s Eye could see through things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne then activated his Satan&rsquo;s Eye, easily finding out what was going on outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he witnessed a mysterious man with eerie eyes pressed against the peephole, a chill ran down his spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though unaware of Milo&rsquo;s motives, Osborne dared not be careless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He remained silent, aiming the gun at Milo&rsquo;s eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rather than shooting immediately, he waited for Milo to open the door, seizing the moment of a sudden change in perspective to fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Draco Model H mini-handgun, renowned for having the world&rsquo;s fastest bullet speed, unleashed a projectile too swift for Milo to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, the bullet struck Milo&rsquo;s eerie right eye, causing a gush of blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; A piercing scream erupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Osborne&rsquo;s expression did not relax; instead, it turned grave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The reason being that Milo, despite being shot in the eye, was not dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Astonishingly, the bullet was lodged firmly in his peculiar eyeball.</p><div class="pagination">
