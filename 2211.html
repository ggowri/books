  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Racial Convergence Planet?!" Isa exchanged worried glances with her companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After vanquishing Lord Malevolence, they had become the undisputed rulers of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life there was comfortable and secure, a far cry from the uncertainties of Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never set foot on Racial Convergence Planet, but they were well aware of its reputation. It was the largest, most prosperous life planet in the entire star system, a veritable sanctuary for cultivators.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Racial Convergence Planet, powerhouses were everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a place like Racial Convergence Planet, it was almost laughable to think that one could drop just a single brick and take out a bunch of Supernal Deity Kings, not to mention potentially flattening an Empyrean Sacredness warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer number of strong beings there was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they ruled </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet with an iron fist, their status would be far less impressive on Racial Convergence Planet. In the more remote areas, they might still carve out a kingdom, perhaps even establish a faction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like Lord Malevolence had done before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence had once founded the Malevolence Empire on Racial Convergence Planet, but his empire had been among the weakest and was swiftly crushed by the surrounding powers, forcing him to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That had all happened in the far reaches of the planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the central areas of Racial Convergence Planet, any major faction could effortlessly annihilate </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet. Take the Mystic Sirius Sect as an illustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders and leaders there were all Empyrean Sacredness-level warriors, but even they were just an ordinary faction in the big picture, outshone by numerous other groups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa and the others were reluctant about Osborne's plan to head to Racial Convergence Planet so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when they saw the resolve on his face, they decided not to air their worries. He had made his decision, and all they could do was stand by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days later, the Empire of the Sun was officially founded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took the throne as king, and the news spread like wildfire. Everyone whole-heartedly accepted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was the one who had defeated Lord Malevolence single-handedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumors that Osborne was the reincarnation of the God of Night had also swept across </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, squashing any opposition. Even those who might have been against him kept quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the grand coronation ceremony, Osborne summoned the elite members of the Human Community and the various races that had been under Lord Malevolence's rule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stood in front of them, they all shouted in unison, "Your Majesty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him stood Isa, Clarissa, Emma, Anita, Austin, Anastasia, Zoe, Jethro, and Sebastian&mdash;his trusted allies and family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no intention of handling the day-to-day operations of the Empire of the Sun. That was what his loyal companions were for. They were the ones who would ensure the empire ran like a well-oiled machine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the coronation ceremony concluded, Osborne felt a wave of exhaustion wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just physical fatigue; it was a deep, soul-wearying exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he planned to step back from leadership for a while and enter a period of seclusion. He needed to consolidate the immense power he had gained recently and integrate the techniques from his past life into his current abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he retreated, Osborne issued two important directives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, he ordered a comprehensive search for his parents&mdash;Theodore and Vivienne. No matter what it took, even if it meant turning </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet upside down, they had to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second, he mandated a thorough investigation into the factions under Lord Malevolence that had previously slaughtered and enslaved members of the Human Community. There would be no mercy; those responsible would be punished, and if necessary, executed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne entered the Hope Haven, ready to begin his seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation level stood at Ascension Four Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had achieved mid-Level Ten in his primary elemental essences&mdash;space, dark, and lightning&mdash;and was on the verge of reaching the pinnacle of Level Ten, the limit beneath Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, Osborne had successfully fused his dark and space elemental essences ahead of schedule, granting him Sacred Power. This newfound power was the key to his ability to challenge and ultimately defeat Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye was the foundation of Osborne's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now at Sacredness Level, its incredible vision and X-ray vision continued to be invaluable assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Satan's Eye bestowed upon him the time power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's time manipulation abilities had surpassed even Ophelia's, although he rarely utilized them to their full extent. Most of the time, he simply accelerated time to give himself more opportunities to train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he had set the time around him to a hundred times faster than normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could have cranked up the time acceleration even more, but he had learned the hard way in his past life that going too fast could backfire spectacularly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing the limits beyond a hundredfold would mess with the fundamental laws of the universe, turning cultivation into a frustrating exercise in futility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred times the speed was just right&mdash;a sweet spot that balanced efficiency and safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, that was more than sufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye was another game-changer in his cultivation journey. It continuously absorbed and broke down the energy from Sacred Crystals, providing a steady stream of support as Osborne worked to level up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Satan's Eye was absolutely essential for Osborne's advancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there were the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and the Orb of Reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were Sacred Artifacts, but one was in pretty rough shape, which limited its effectiveness, while the other didn't offer any offensive or defensive capabilities, making it less than helpful for Osborne's cultivation level advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the flip side, the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, although just a quasi-Sacred Artifact, had massive potential. With a stash of a thousand Azure Ores at his disposal, Osborne was convinced that integrating them into the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow could elevate it to a true Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could pull that off, even the most basic Sacred Artifact would give a serious boost to his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, the wisdom he had gained from his previous life as a dedicated cultivator&mdash;someone who had devoted himself entirely to training&mdash;had armed him with valuable insights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it didn't directly increase his strength, it certainly filled in the blanks in his understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a solid grasp of his current abilities, Osborne set about outlining his next objectives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first order of business is to break through to the next cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Four is just too weak! It might fly on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet, but on Racial Convergence Planet, I'd be a laughingstock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up, I need to integrate more power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The potency of my Sacred Power relies on how many different energies I can blend together. I'm bound to run into Empyrean Sacredness warriors over there&mdash;potential foes I can't afford to underestimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I go up against Empyrean Sacredness, most of my tricks won't stand a chance! I've got to </span><span>amp</span><span> up my Sacred Power if I want to hold my own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alright then, it's time to get serious and dive into my training!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that newfound resolve, Osborne fully committed to his seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he shut himself away, he collected the majority of the Element Gold Crystals </span><span>and Sacred Crystals he had snagged from the Dark Earth Continent. Handing them over to Isa and the others, he made sure they were distributed wisely to help boost their own strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was worth mentioning that Osborne had already resurrected the members of both the Blood Demon and the Hudson family, and a portion of the Element Gold Crystals and Sacred Crystals he had collected belonged to them as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had also restored the freedom of the Blood Demon members, meaning they were no longer his Blood Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only seven remained under his command&mdash;Maddox and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time flowed swiftly by, aided by the power of Satan's Eye and the hundredfold acceleration, Osborne's cultivation level began to rise rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was advancing through Ascension Five and continuing on to Ascension Six.</span></p><div class="pagination">
