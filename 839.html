  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face was grim.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An S-class deity, or Lesser God, was no small threat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To become a true god with unimaginable power, one would need to advance far beyond this level.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, being only at Class AAA, was no match for a standard S-class, let alone a full-fledged deity. Yet, the God of Star was asking him to take on a real god.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as he thought about Yulissa and Kendra, who were at the mercy of Dark Deity and were on the verge of having their life essence drained, Osborne's resolve hardened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was no time to look for help.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took a deep breath and asked, "Sir, how powerful is Dark Deity? Do I stand a chance against him?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">God of Star's expression showed doubt.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since he's just woken up, he hasn't regained his full strength. After our battle, he's severely injured. Right now, his power is less than one ten-thousandth of his peak."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt a bit of relief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But God of Star's next words dashed his hopes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even so, his current strength is roughly on par with an ordinary Lesser God."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face turned serious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even at less than one ten-thousandth of his full power, Dark Deity was still as strong as a regular S-class.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The gap between him and a deity was staggering.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He recalled how he had struggled against Marvin, a standard S-class, and barely survived with Isa's help.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even with his enhanced abilities and powerful techniques, Osborne wasn't sure he could handle a typical S-class deity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he had no choice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't let Dark Deity harm Yulissa and Kendra.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just killing a god, right?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"An ordinary S-class deity is at his weakest. Isa would handle him with ease!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I can't defeat such a deity, I'll never stand a chance against Isa in the upcoming Honor Quest Ceremony!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have to do this!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where is he?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face burned with determination. Whether it was to save Yulissa and Kendra or to stop an evil deity from regaining strength and threatening the world's peace, he knew he had to act.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">God of Star's face lit up with excitement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's awake now, but he hasn't broken free from my seal. If you keep going straight, you'll reach an open space where I've been holding him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm too injured to help any further, so you're on your own."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes lit up with an idea.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir, maybe I can use the Light of Redemption to heal your injuries!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Light of Redemption?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">God of Star's expression turned contemplative. It was clear that Osborne's ability to wield this power came from him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That won't help," God of Star said, shaking his head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"While the Light of Redemption is powerful and can heal wounds, restore energy, and remove negative effects, it won't work on the kind of injuries I've sustained.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My wounds are from Dark Deity's divine power. Your current strength isn't enough to heal injuries caused by such power. Unless you reach the level of a Lesser God, your Light of Redemption won't make a difference."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was taken aback.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had never dealt with such severe injuries before and found it odd that the God of Star seemed to know so much about his power without having seen it firsthand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Osborne could ask more, God of Star continued.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't waste your energy on me. Use it to fight Dark Deity instead! Evil deities are called that not just because they want to enslave the world but because their very nature is opposed to holy light.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your light power will weaken his form. Otherwise, I wouldn't have let you face him with your current strength."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded, his resolve firm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Understood. I'll handle it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll save my friends and take down Dark Deity!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Head out now!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">God of Star nodded. "Make sure you come back alive! When you return, I can teach you more about using light elemental and even help you strengthen your Light Realm!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And if you find yourself struggling, don't hesitate to call your girlfriend for help."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stiffened at the mention of his girlfriend but quickly regained his composure.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He nodded, said nothing more, and proceeded into the depths.</p><div class="pagination">
