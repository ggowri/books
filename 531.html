  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry said, glaring at Osborne, "That's right. We don't like that you're picking on women. We're here to teach you a lesson! If you're still a man, then accept the challenge."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John added, "Don't worry about us ganging up on you. You can choose any one of us as your opponent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Though I'd advise you to pick me. I'm the weaker of the two, and if you don't choose me, you won't stand a chance at winning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they finished their taunts, Osborne couldn't help but chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He remained calm and replied, "We're all part of the Augustine family's branch bloodlines. Must we fight? Such conflicts could damage the relations between our branches."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry sneered, saying, "Enough talk. We're fighting today, no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just give us a straight answer&mdash;will you accept the challenge or not? If you refuse, we'll take action right here, and there'll be no consequences for us.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Make your decision quickly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both men stared at Osborne with fierce looks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sighing, Osborne thought, "Since my arrival in Newport City, I've hoped for a low profile and to assess the situation first. Instead, I'm immediately confronted and challenged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A fight was inevitable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that's the case, let's get on with it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was also curious to see what the other branch bloodline heirs of the Augustine family were truly capable of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that thought, Osborne's expression hardened. "So you want a challenge, huh? Fine by me! But I don't do things without a stake. If we're going to fight, let's make it interesting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry and John exchanged glances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you proposing?" Henry asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled, "If I'm not mistaken, the Augustine family's main bloodline provides valuable resources to the branch bloodlines every year, correct?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two men's expressions hardened slightly, but they nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's right. Thanks to the resources from the main bloodline, our branch bloodlines have been able to grow rapidly and remain strong. The Dampston branch bloodline, which is currently the ninth branch, will also receive resources in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The amount of resources depends entirely on your rank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The higher your rank, the more resources you get. At minimum, they're worth tens of billions, and they're items you can't even buy with money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He grinned and said, "Alright, let's wager those precious resources from the Augustine family's main bloodline. If I lose, I'll apologize to Evelynn and give each of your branch families a ten percent share of the resources. If you lose, you'll each give the Dampston branch ten percent of your resources."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He challenged them with a defiant look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both men frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Losing ten percent of those valuable resources was no small deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though it might not seem like a huge percentage, it would still sting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, they both nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry said coldly, "Fine by us. If we lose, each of our branch families will give ten percent of our resources to the Dampston branch. And if you lose, you'll give ten percent of the resources to each of our branch families."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Great, it's settled then! Lead the way to Challenge Peak."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry and John turned with smirks, heading out of the Ninth Estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne followed them, maintaining his calm demeanor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Nathan and Queenie, along with the others, exchanged worried glances. Gritting their teeth, they quickly fell in step behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, their group arrived at Challenge Peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Challenge Peak was a unique mountain, resembling a massive meteor that had crashed into the planet, composed entirely of an exceptionally hard rock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This rock was found nowhere else on this planet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mountain itself was hollow, with a dozen or so chambers of varying sizes inside. Each chamber was a fighting arena. Even a Class A power master, using their full strength, would struggle to make a dent in the mountain, let alone leave a mark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever a dispute arose among members of the Augustine family, they would settle it on Challenge Peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Likewise, any other factions challenging the Augustine family would do so on this very peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Essentially, Challenge Peak served as the arena for all such confrontations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how fierce the battle was, there was no worry about damaging the structure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne and his group soon arrived at the base of Challenge Peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was hard to believe that it was a single, solid piece of rock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even more astonishing were the numerous chambers inside, each one converted into a numbered arena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The arenas closer to the beginning of the numbering were larger, with the largest, Arena Number One, stretching over a radius of around one mile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry and John led Osborne and the others to Arena Number Nine, which had a radius of about three hundred yards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry said coldly, pointing, "Head over to the viewing stands over there. There are special devices that will protect you from the fallout of the battle."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, turning his icy gaze to Osborne, he said, "Now, you can choose your opponent. Do you want to face him first, or would you prefer to take me on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne merely smiled, his expression calm and composed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need for that. I think it would be more interesting if you both fought me together."</p><div class="pagination">
