  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin watched in heartache as Crimson plunged the dagger into her own heart, the act of a brutal farewell that ignited a rage within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw his head back and roared at the sky, a sound filled with pure sorrow and wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!! Osborne, I swear I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's cries were raw and desperate, tears streaming down his face as he cast one final, pained glance at Crimson's lifeless body before gently laying her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer burdened by Crimson's weight, Sin's power surged, fueled by a burning desire for vengeance. He attacked Osborne with a fury that left everyone around him trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked as he realized he could no longer counter Sin's onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous crack, Osborne was sent flying by Sin's assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin surged forward, intent on finishing Osborne once and for all. But that wasn't going to happen; five hundred Blood Demon members attacked him like a tidal wave, aimed at halting his advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Sin skidded to a halt, icy determination gleaming in his eyes as he stared down Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, just you wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You killed my daughter, murdered my wife. I swear to the heavens above, I will take your life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better be ready! I'll be back, and when I return, the entire </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization will rise against you, hunting down everyone you care about!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mark my words!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's voice rang with crazy fury. Just before the Blood Demon members launched another wave of attacks, he dashed away, disappearing into the dense jungle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After him!" Osborne's face went pale, and without hesitation, he rallied his Blood Demon members to pursue Sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was a powder keg about to explode. Osborne knew that his hatred could not be soothed, and the only way to ensure their safety was to eliminate Sin for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he made his move, Osborne staggered, his expression changed as he coughed up blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His wounds were far too severe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was watch helplessly as Sin vanished into the woods, slipping beyond his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin had escaped!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of grave concern wash over him. Sin's parting words nagged at </span><span>him; the next time, the stakes would be even higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne pressed down his concern soon, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But next time you come after me. I'll probably be a Class S by then! Who knows if it'll be you killing me or me killing you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare come back, and I'll be waiting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll send you to hell to reunite with your family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this, Osborne commanded the Lambert family to quickly clear the battlefield. They had suffered big losses today&mdash;over three hundred Lambert family members lay dead at Sin's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their numbers dwindling, they were now down to just six hundred survivors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lambert family stood there with sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were down but not out. Miraculously, six hundreds of them had survived, fingers still clutching at life's edge. Sin and Crimson were too formidable forces, and without Osborne's timely protection, they'd have been wiped off the map, no question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, the Lambert family got to work, tidying up the battlefield. They buried their kin&mdash;right there where they fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne collected the scattered blood energy left in the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get back to the Augustine Estate!" Osborne said, rising despite his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he hadn't fully healed, he was determined to push through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Lambert family's convoy set off, overhead, dozens of helicopters buzzed protectively, carrying five hundred Blood Demon members ensuring their safety along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the next six hours, nothing happened to the journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they arrived at the Augustine Estate, Wesson was waiting at Mount Nine, having prepared a safe haven for the weary Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted from the day's horrors, they quickly fell into a slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't rest just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly issued orders. "Mr. Wesson Augustine, tell everyone to stay alert! The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization is likely to strike back soon, and we need to be vigilant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Members of Blood Demon and Draco Armed Services Branch, disperse and fortify our defenses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine Estate was vast, covered in high-end technology designed to prevent ordinary </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins from breaking in. However, those top-level Class S assassins posed a significant challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, with the defenses provided by Blood Demon and Draco Armed Services Branch, even the most elite of Class S assassins might hesitate to infiltrate, knowing they might not leave alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having set up the defenses, Osborne returned to Mount Celestial Reach to check on his grandfather, Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian lay unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His injuries were bad, rendering any medical intervention useless. His vitality waned with each passing moment, and the question of whether he could survive remained uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew somber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, just hold on a little longer! I'll break through to Class S soon, and then I can save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that whispered promise, Osborne left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black cat suddenly appeared, scampering up to perch on Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Shadow." Osborne chuckled, stroking the cat's silky fur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go check on Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hopefully, she's awake by now. If so, I can make my breakthrough to Class S immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne prepared to head to the dungeon with Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just then, his phone buzzed. Upon answering, Osborne paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, something happened to your sister Anastasia!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
