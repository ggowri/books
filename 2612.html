  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Satan's Eye, like a precise scanning device, quickly conducted a detailed analysis of each Supreme Sacred Artifact around, grasping their conditions and characteristics one by one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was also quickly analyzing which Supreme Sacred Artifact could bring him the greatest enhancement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>First, offensive Sacred Artifacts were not necessary for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two offensive Sacred Artifacts he currently used most often, Bloodwrought Bow and Warfare Scythe, though classified as Superior and vastly inferior to Supreme, were the weapons he was most familiar with and could wield to their fullest potential.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if a stronger Supreme Sacred Artifact was placed before him, Osborne would never replace them easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Bloodwrought Bow had long fused with his body, becoming an inseparable part of him. Only when using the Bloodwrought Bow could Osborne unleash the full power of the Solar Sacred Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This seamless synergy was something no Supreme Sacred Artifact could replace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the Warfare Scythe, it had fused with the fangs of the Primordial Creature Necrosnake, granting it an extremely abnormal trait: ultimate sharpness and durability.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it might not directly enhance Osborne's power, its unique sharpness was unmatched by any other Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Osborne's Warfare Blade Technique was self-created based on the traits of the Warfare Scythe. With the Bloodwrought Bow for ranged attacks and the Warfare Scythe for close combat, his need for offensive Sacred Artifacts was nearly nonexistent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, if the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were too abundant to spend and there were no better options, Osborne might consider selecting an offensive Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the current situation, that&rsquo;s clearly impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next is the Defensive Sacred Artifact. Osborne is not lacking in this area either. His Warfare Shield, though only at the Superior level and not top-tier in defense, is a product nurtured by the Warfare Ancient Tree, embodying much of its essence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Shield can even unleash Warfare Mist, with limitless potential.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as the Warfare Ancient Tree exists, the Warfare Shield can fully evolve into a Legendary Sacred Artifact in the future, or even a Supreme Sacred Artifact or Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, Osborne also possesses several other powerful defensive Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, the Invictus Seal compensated to him by Aaron, a Supreme Sacred Artifact capable of releasing the Invictus Field to trap enemies. Even a powerhouse at Adriana's level would find it difficult to break this field from within.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There's also the Star Token recently gifted to him by Adriana, which not only provides protection during a fatal attack but also teleports him to a safe place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Plus, the relic he just received from Michelle, the token engraved with her name, is also an extremely powerful defensive Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even her other relic, the ring, can unleash defense to protect Osborne at critical moments.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Defensive Sacred Artifacts are already sufficient.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with a few more, they wouldn't significantly enhance his combat power, as he rarely relies on these defensive items in actual battles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When true danger strikes, what he needs more is not stronger defense, but faster retreat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, Osborne quickly ruled out all offensive and defensive Supreme Sacred Artifacts around him and turned his attention to other possible options.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he needs is a supportive Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne locked onto his first target. It was an extremely peculiar Sacred Artifact, shaped like a tombstone!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tombstone was dark and worn, massive in size. Its surface was engraved with several glossy black characters: Domain Suppression Stele!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Domain Suppression Stele exuded an extremely powerful aura, making it one of the strongest among all the surrounding Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when Osborne saw its exchange price, he couldn't help but freeze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Five billion Scorepoints!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only five billion Scorepoints were needed to exchange for this Domain Suppression Stele. This price was almost the lowest among Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only those incomplete Supreme Sacred Artifacts would be cheaper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It has such a powerful Sacred Artifact aura, yet its exchange price is only five billion? Other Supreme Sacred Artifacts of the same strength require at least twenty billion or even more! How interesting!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne approached the Domain Suppression Stele and began to carefully sense its effects. In fact, he didn&rsquo;t need to test it himself because its functions were clearly marked on the back of the stele. "After activating the Domain Suppression Stele, it can suppress all energy flows nearby. No existence is allowed to use any power other than physical strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After reading these descriptions, Osborne's eyes lit up instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Suppress all nearby energy flows? Rely only on physical strength? Unable to use other abilities?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder the price of this Sacred Artifact is so low. For most people, such an effect is utterly useless. Especially in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the Royal Family is Human. Humans are naturally physically weak, whether compared to the powerful Beast Clan or other races like the Bug Clan or Spirit Clan, their physical strength is at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the Domain Suppression Stele is activated, only melee combat is possible within a certain range. For Humans, this is practically tying their own hands and feet, limiting their strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pondered for a moment, a smile appearing at the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he realized that this Domain Suppression Stele was practically tailor-made for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His current physical strength has nearly reached Flash's level. Among beings of the same cultivation level, his physical strength is absolutely top-notch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even those Silicon-based Lifeforms, if at the same cultivation level as him, would find it hard to claim superiority over his physical strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I must get this Domain Suppression Stele!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I encounter a tough warrior, I can activate the Domain Suppression Stele, forcing them into hand-to-hand combat with me, deciding the outcome through physical strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And my physical strength, even when facing warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection or even Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, is not inferior, perhaps even stronger!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The effect of this Domain Suppression Stele suited him perfectly, offering a brand-new strategy when facing warriors far beyond his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne no longer hesitated and immediately placed the Kingdom Duel Badge on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the deduction of five billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, he successfully obtained the Domain Suppression Stele.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He put it away and continued searching for other targets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were down to 34 billion, but time was running out. Osborne had to speed up, or these points would go to waste.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he found a second target.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a massive Sacred Artifact, arguably the largest item in the entire Royal Treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a mountain!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's right, a mountain! This massive mountain radiated a strong Sacred Artifact aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its exchange price was as high as 30 billion!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among all Supreme Sacred Artifacts, the exchange price of this mountain-shaped Sacred Artifact definitely ranks in the top ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its name is quite unique, Sacred Turtle Mountain!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire mountain's shape resembles a giant Sacred Turtle lying on the ground!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne excitedly said, "It's you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
