  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the strength of a Class B+ metahuman? It is at least ten times stronger than Apollo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he had killed Apollo, it had been extremely dangerous. He had only barely managed to do it, and now faced with Derek, who was ten times stronger, he had no confidence at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he could not just sit and wait for death without any certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to kill me? It would not be that easy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was extremely grateful at this moment. He had just absorbed Apollo's wind elemental essence, which had greatly improved his control over the wind elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he felt the terrifying attacks from Derek, he drew upon the wind elemental essence to weaken the tornado's force and enveloped himself with a red Devil's Light to enhance his defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Derek was too strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was still not even at Class B, and there was a whole major difference in their levels. His defense could not hold up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne growled, his eyes flashing with a fierce light. The only solution he could think of was to fuse the lightning and wind elemental essences into a level two or even level three Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only this way might he have a chance to survive in front of Derek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the process of fusing element essences was risky. If interrupted, Osborne could be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such an intense battle, one slip could lead to disaster or even death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had no other choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Derek, you have forced my hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured and prepared to take the risk of fusion. Even if it meant death, it was better than doing nothing and being killed by Derek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a clear, cold snort suddenly sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bullying the weak, what skill is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A giant energy fist suddenly appeared in the void, shaking violently as if the sky itself were about to split out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fist smashed into the tornadoes, causing them to collapse instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fist then struck Derek directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's face turned pale with shock as he spewed out a mouthful of blood. His body was thrown high into the air as if hit by a train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barely managed to stabilize himself in the void, his face filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which senior was involved?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek looked around but could not find the attacker. He was filled with dread and fear, unable to focus on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the viewing platform, everyone was equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew who had made the attack, and the powerful punch had frightened Derek so much that he dared not continue fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be a Class A master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion also had a serious expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Osborne was overjoyed, for he recognized the voice&mdash;it was Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could not help but gasp in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Isa was strong, or he would not have called her to hold the fort. But he never expected her to be this unbelievably powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek was a Class B+ metahuman, just a step away from becoming a Class A master. To have such a powerful figure injured by a single punch from Isa was astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Isa, what level is she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could she be a Class A martial master?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how old is she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed younger than me, and a martial master so young was hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of monster is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was in utter shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Old fool, get lost! You have broken the rules of this match. If you dare to attack again, I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's voice rang out again, though it was disguised to sound like a middle-aged woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's face grew even darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled slightly as he glared at Osborne with hatred. Osborne had killed his son, and he could not avenge him, which filled him with immense rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the head of the ancient Chevalier family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, It is fine! Today I will spare you for the sake of the senior, but once we are out of this canyon, I will kill him to avenge my son! No one will save him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You brat, just wait! I will tear you apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Derek quickly used a tornado to lift Apollo's corpse and flew back to the observation platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The viewing platform was now quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was intimidated by the sudden appearance of the powerful figure. They looked at Derek with solemnity, not mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Clarissa breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The match is over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna murmured, "I do not know if this result is good or bad for the Radcliffe family. In any case, Apollo is dead and the Chevalier family would not let it go. Skyefall will be in turmoil."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Apollo's death, the battle in the canyon had lost all suspense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few members of the Viper Squad, seeing Apollo dead, went berserk and fought desperately. But with Osborne's intervention, they were soon all killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All thirty members of the Chevalier Security, including Apollo, died in battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Skyefall Security had only a few injuries and no deaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security, a complete victory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Derek, your Chevalier family has lost. Now it is time to fulfill the bet! One billion dollars, what will you use to pay?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
