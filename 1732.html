  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich looked down at Raoul with a sneer, entirely dismissive of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready to strike,</span><span> </span><span>intent on taking Raoul down alongside Maxime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a figure shot down from the Supreme Malevolence Airship, swiftly positioning himself beside Aldrich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Alfred!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich frowned, irritation crossing his features. "Alfred, what are you doing down here? You should have stayed on the Supreme Malevolence Airship. You haven't achieved Deity King status yet, and this battlefield is chaotic</span><span>, </span><span>too dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a genius of the Bowman family and one of our heirs. I can't afford to lose you here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred merely smiled softly in response, "Uncle Aldrich, don't worry about me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of everyone here, the only one I really need to watch out for is Maxime, and he's already injured. The Mystic Feather Clan's remaining Deity Kings pose no real threat to me now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watching this fight has made me a bit restless; I'm not just a genius who shuts </span><span>himself away to break through levels. I also have plenty of battlefield experience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his gaze toward Raoul, a proud grin stretching across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, old man, you think you can save the Mystic Feather Clan? I'll tell you what: I'll give you a chance. If one of you can defeat me in a one-on-one fight, I'll let you and your people go. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he raised his voice, calling out, "Everyone, halt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, fighters from the Bowman family, Demonic Dragon Clan, and Soaring Lion Clan began to retreat, encircling the Mystic Feather Clan on the floating mountain without launching another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred's eyes gleamed with challenge as he addressed the members of the Mystic Feather Clan, "Listen up, you miserable traitors! I'm offering you a chance at survival! If any one of you can defeat me in single combat, I will spare your lives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you can't, well, it's curtains for all of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a confident sweep of his gaze across the audience, he added, "I'm only at the peak of Deity Overlord, just a Quasi-Deity King! Yet, here you are, with 11 Deity Kings among you! You're not going to shy away from a challenge, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excited murmurs rippled through the gathered crowd, including the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock was evident on their faces, but beneath the surface, a spark of hope flickered to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was there a chance for survival, after all? If just one among them could defeat Alfred, they might live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate glances turned toward their remaining Deity King warriors. They were praying one of them would step up to defeat Alfred and secure their chance for survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers couldn't help but stir in reaction to the unfolding drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Alfred from the Bowman family! He's a prodigy and one of three heirs! I can't believe he's so confident!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though Maxime is out of commission, the Mystic Feather Clan still has 10 Deity King warriors left! Sure, they're battered and worn from battle, but Deity Kings are formidable! Raoul is no slouch compared to Maxime, either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does Alfred really think he can take on all of them? What kind of confidence is this? He's still just a Quasi-Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If a Quasi-Deity King can truly beat a Deity King, then he must be the cream of the crop among geniuses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could Alfred really be that strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd remained skeptical. To them, the divide between a Deity King and a peak Deity Overlord felt insurmountable</span><span>, </span><span>like a chasm too wide to bridge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Alfred was the prodigious talent from the Bowman family, the odds of him defeating a Deity King seemed almost impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, surprisingly, neither Aldrich nor the members of the Bowman family voiced any objections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a grin, Aldrich remarked, "Alfred, your confidence is really growing! This is great; if you're itching for a fight, I won't rush to finish them off. Go ahead and spar </span><span>with them first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred nodded, turning his attention to the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? Are you afraid? Let me make this crystal clear: if any one of you can defeat me in a one-on-one fight, I will spare the Mystic Feather Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you don't have the guts, I'll have no choice but to wipe you all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes darkened with lethal intent, making his threat even more palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, one of the Deity King warriors from the Mystic Feather Clan could no longer hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take you on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfred, are you really sure that if one of us defeats you, you'll let everyone in the Mystic Feather Clan go? You're a prodigy of the Paramount Supreme Clan</span><span>. S</span><span>urely you wouldn't renege on your word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sarcastic smile crossed Alfred's face. "Of course not! There are too many witnesses here. My word is solid, and everyone can hold me accountable! In fact, you're welcome to bring a partner...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just make sure your partner doesn't exceed mid-stage Deity King. If you can beat me with them, I'll let the entire </span><span>Mystic Feather Clan walk</span><span> free!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deity King from the Mystic Feather Clan lit up at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'll accept your challenge! You're telling me a peak Deity Overlord like you can really take down a Deity King? I don't believe it!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
