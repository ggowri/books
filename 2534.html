  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Dalia spotted Osborne, his Satan's Eye began throbbing wildly, warning him of imminent danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He unleashed his spatial power without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment his body vanished, hundreds of tentacles struck fiercely, but he had already flashed to a distance, continuing to use Satan's Eye's ocular energy to collect corpses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people were already dead. Osborne didn't want to waste these corpses. They were nourishment for the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Almost there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne muttered softly, "I've collected the corpses and Dimensional Bags of warriors at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, and Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection levels! The remaining ones at mid and primary levels are just too many, I have to give up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dalia has her eyes on me. Even though I have spatial power, I can't dodge all her attacks. One mistake, and it's over!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So now, I need to leave the Phantomagic Realm first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Phantomagic Realm was so fragile it was on the verge of collapse, but there was still a little time before it completely disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With just this bit of time, Dalia could still kill everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out the Bloodwrought Bow at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Heaven Arrow!" he shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A dazzling arrow appeared on the Bloodwrought Bow, his most powerful attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a "whoosh," the Heaven Arrow shot out, striking the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The already collapsing space was completely pierced by this arrow, letting starlight from the outside pour in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately after, with a loud bang, the entire Phantomagic Realm completely shattered. Everyone felt their vision blur. They all saw the nearby Inferno Planet and the situation outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surviving thousands were stunned at first, then their faces lit up with excitement and joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Phantomagic Realm has shattered!" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're saved!" another person shouted excitedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Run quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People instantly scattered in all directions, fleeing for their lives. Osborne also rushed toward Inferno Planet without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're so damned!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia's furious voice came from behind Osborne. Ignoring the others fleeing, she chased after Osborne relentlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her cultivation level had already reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, making her speed terrifying. Even though Osborne kept using interdimensional travel, the distance between them was still rapidly closing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia's hundreds of terrifying tentacles lunged at Osborne wildly. Those tentacles, filled with deadly intent and immense power, sent chills through Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could even feel the breath of death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Satan's Eye throbbed wildly. Osborne felt he had no time to use spatial power to evade Dalia's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt a chill all over and shouted loudly in the direction of Inferno Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana! Help!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Save me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he finished shouting, Osborne felt Dalia's terrifying tentacles already behind him. It seemed they could pierce through his body in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the critical moment, Osborne clenched his teeth, and a Sacred Artifact appeared in his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a fist-sized seal with intricate patterns. This seal, called the Invictus Seal, was a Supreme Sacred Artifact, considered a support-type Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Invictus Seal was compensation from Brenda's master, Aaron, an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior. It could unleash immense power, sealing an entire area, famously known as the Invictus Field!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, the Invictus Seal contained the power infused by Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne prepared to activate the Invictus Field to protect himself!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was his final line of defense and his strongest one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hope it can block Dalia's attack, or I'm done for!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought of this and got ready to act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just then, he suddenly felt his vision blur. Then, a tall and perfect figure stood in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana finally appeared!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed at this moment, but suddenly saw Dalia's hundreds of tentacles rapidly stabbing toward Adriana's chest. His face instantly changed drastically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hurriedly shouted, "Ms. Alba, be careful! This monster's tentacles are deadly. They can easily pierce through defenses. Once touched by them, you'll lose the ability to resist!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, Adriana smiled faintly. "Oh? That powerful? Then I must give it a try."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana actually stood still, not moving at all, letting those hundreds of tentacles stab toward her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne froze. He looked at Adriana in astonishment. The moment those hundreds of tentacles stabbed at Adriana, they actually stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did they fail to pierce Adriana's body, but they also began to collapse and disintegrate, retreating quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Doesn't seem as strong as you claimed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled faintly and continued, "But! Didn't you say the demonic cultivator behind this only reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection? Yet this person has reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good thing I came, or an ordinary person wouldn't be able to handle her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was speechless upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had witnessed how terrifying those tentacles were, yet Adriana effortlessly neutralized the attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without even seeing Adriana defend, the tentacles were completely ineffective, and most of them collapsed and disintegrated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this what a true warrior is?" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was deeply shocked, feeling his breath quicken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia's expression was extremely grave at this moment. She stared at Adriana, a hint of wariness in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you?" Dalia asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana gave a faint smile. "Who I am doesn't matter! What matters is... I'm here to deal with you, demonic cultivator! Unfortunately, I acted too late. Tens of thousands of cultivators from various clans entered the Phantomagic Realm, but only a few thousand made it out alive. The rest were all killed by you, weren't they?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia's face darkened further upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So what if I killed them? They were just my food! Merely nourishment for me to break through my cultivation level! I advise you to mind your own business and get lost immediately! You want to deal with me? I don't think you have what it takes!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Dalia finished speaking, she looked at Osborne. At this moment, her eyes were filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You damned thief, give me back my Bewitching Lantern! Otherwise, no one in this world can save you! That woman's cultivation level may have reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, but even she can't save you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying killing intent weighed so heavily on Osborne that he could barely breathe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit nervous. He looked at Adriana, somewhat worried if she could handle it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled and said, "You dare threaten my person right in front of me? How arrogant! What makes you think I can't save him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By killing you, no one can threaten him anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana walked step by step toward Dalia. Her movements seemed casual, yet her speed was at its peak. She appeared near Dalia almost as if teleporting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia's expression changed drastically, and she immediately prepared to act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Adriana reached out, and a massive hand formed by Sacred Power instantly appeared, grabbing Dalia's throat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With just this bit of strength? You dare act so arrogantly?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's face was full of disdain. "You've killed so many people, truly despicable. A demonic cultivator like you should just disappear forever!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana's Sacred Power hand clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud bang, Dalia's body exploded instantly...</span></p><div class="pagination">
