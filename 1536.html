  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment Osborne broke through to Transcendent Deity, he entered a state of profound transformation. His body and soul began to undergo a metamorphosis, causing his Eclipsing Mantra to falter just when he needed it most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the massive energy surge from his breakthrough erupted outward, rippling through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne quickly regained his composure and activated his concealment technique once more, masking the energy fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, the brief spike in energy wouldn't attract any attention, especially since he was deep within an abandoned mining cave, a place that bore the marks of having been untouched for ages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the energy concealed, Osborne settled back into the sensation of his newfound power, completely oblivious to the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea that the momentary leak of energy had been captured by the special token on Tobey, a genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey stared at the token on his chest, his expression shifting from excitement to confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The energy wave just vanished?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His curiosity piqued, he turned to Myron and asked, "Did you guys from the Royston family have a Deity Overlord-level warrior lurking around here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron and Sara exchanged puzzled glances and shook their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Mr. Tobey Bowman. None of our Deity Overlord warriors are nearby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sly smile crept across Tobey's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that's interesting! Could it be another Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>? Or maybe a warrior from another faction sneaking around in your mining area? Either way, someone just caught my attention. Let's go check it out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tobey strode forward with purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tobey Bowman, wait!" Myron's voice rose in alarm. "We shouldn't rush in! If it's a Deity Overlord-level presence, the three of us might not stand a chance. We could be walking into a trap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey shrugged off their concerns, confidence radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's there to fear? With my current strength, even if I run into a Deity Overlord warrior, I can hold my own for a while. If things get dicey, I can always make a run for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, I've got the Supreme Malevolence Airship on my side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even a peak Deity Overlord or a Deity King would have a tough time taking me down. I can just retreat into the airship and counterattack with its main and secondary cannons! If it gets really hairy, I can use interdimensional travel to escape. No Deity King is going to catch me! So, let's not worry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tobey pressed on toward the source of the energy fluctuation, his face devoid of fear, brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron and Sara exchanged glances, realizing that Tobey's status as a genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan meant he had resources and power far beyond their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Supreme Malevolence Airship backing him, they felt reassured and quickly followed suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Tobey pointed ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where does that lead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron hurried to explain, "Mr. Tobey Bowman, that's an abandoned mining cave. The Essence Crystals around here were all mined out long ago, which is why it's been sealed off. No one has come here in ages."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey took a moment to examine the cave's surroundings closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It really does look untouched. But I definitely sensed that powerful energy wave coming from deep within this cave! What on earth could be hiding down there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I'm even more curious! Let's find out what's lurking in the depths!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a response, Tobey stepped into the dark mouth of the abandoned mine, his heart racing with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they moved deeper into the abandoned mine, Tobey and his companions suppressed their divine power, treading lightly as if afraid to disturb the mysterious presence that lay within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this heightened state of focus, Osborne remained blissfully unaware of their approach, completely absorbed in his breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After navigating through the dimly lit tunnels for some time, the trio finally reached the spot where Osborne was undergoing his transformation. They spotted him from a distance, sitting cross-legged in a meditative posture, eyes closed as he pushed through the barriers of his current realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey froze, a mix of awe and disbelief washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened as he clearly perceived the divine power swirling around Osborne, pulsating and transforming in a chaotic dance, unmistakably signaling a monumental breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite this vivid display, Tobey's senses failed to pick up anything beyond that powerful energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Tobey's expression hardened, his gaze turning icy. "So that energy surge </span><span>I felt earlier, comparable to a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, came from him? He's breaking through to Deity Overlord? Damn it! He looks so young&mdash;how is he achieving a breakthrough at such a young age? Is he even more of a genius than I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of jealousy and fury flickered in Tobey's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey couldn't stand the idea of another genius rising above him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For such a genius, he had only one thought&mdash;to eliminate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind raced back to the mysterious woman who had defeated him; his first instinct had been to erase her from existence. He wouldn't allow anyone among the myriad races to surpass his brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a murderous glint in his eyes, Tobey turned to Myron and asked, "Do you know him? Is he one of your Royston family's prodigies?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
