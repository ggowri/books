  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, who was in the dungeon, was utterly astonished to see Sam defeated by Aresta in a single move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was well aware of Sam's immense strength and formidable defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after transforming into Vampire could Osborne's power rival Sam's. Even with Point Blank Force, he could only break through Sam's defenses and inflict minor injuries. Ultimately, defeating Sam was a challenging task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Aresta had vanquished Sam with a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such tremendous power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious as he contemplated his chances against Aresta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's just raw power, it's still manageable. But I wonder what other tricks Aresta has up his sleeve. He's only made one move, so it's hard to say for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up, it's Lance's turn, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned his attention to Lance, equally curious about his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the Branch Bloodline Competition, due to the rules, he and Lance didn't face each other, but he could sense that Lance was not to be underestimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Lance posed an even more significant threat than Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aresta should be able to force Lance to reveal his true strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to watch the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance walked out with a gloomy expression. He hadn't expected Sam to be defeated by Aresta in one move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had hoped Sam could wear down Aresta's strength or even force Aresta to reveal his trump card, but now that was no longer possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to defeat Aresta decisively!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta, ranked thirteenth among Yalynch's Godson, was likely the highest-ranked among the remaining four opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he could defeat Aresta, the Augustine family still had a chance to win!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance knew that the current situation was unfavorable for the Augustine family, and his task was to forcefully turn the tide under such adverse circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only in this way could he earn Godfather's approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Lance was ready to give it his all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta looked at Lance and smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you. You were born in Yalynch and were a renowned prodigy there as a child. But later, you came to Rosmandi and didn't participate in Yalynch's Godchild selection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, with the talent you displayed as a child, you would have had a chance to become one of Yalynch's Godson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Lance replied calmly, "Just a chance? I believe if I had stayed in Yalynch, my Godson ranking would be higher than yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's funny!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta sneered, "You want to surpass me in the Godson ranking? Then come and defeat me! I'm afraid you'll be like that guy just now, unable to even withstand a single blow from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, that won't happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then make your move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance prepared himself, taking a deep breath. Satan's Eye instantly activated, and an invisible wave surged around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's starting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, who was in the dungeon, stared intently at Lance. Seeing Lance's actions, he was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is his central power mind control? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta didn't hesitate and threw a powerful punch at Lance. It was the same punch he used to defeat Sam earlier, demonstrating his terrifying strength quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lance, at this moment, wasn't flustered at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ocular energy in his eyes transformed into an invisible mind control force, instantly entwining Aresta's arm and continuously weakening his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Aresta's attack landed, its power had been reduced by at least seventy percent. It hit Lance's defense but didn't cause much damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta's expression immediately changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mind control power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect your mind control to be so powerful, and you can even control it so precisely, integrating it into your combat system!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems today's battle will be a tough one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Aresta attacked again, his power increasing even further. Lance didn't back down, using mind control to both influence Aresta and enhance his strength, engaging in close combat with Aresta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta's power far surpassed Lance's, but Lance's mind control was incredibly potent. He weakened Aresta while strengthening himself, managing to hold his own in the close-quarters combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems Lance has a unique talent for mind control. His abilities far exceed those of any other Augustine," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle raged on, both combatants displaying terrifying power. The sounds of their clashes were like thunder, their movements too fast to follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who will win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustines were on edge. If Lance lost, they would have no further opportunities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, Matthew, Emma, and the others were also deeply concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't want the Augustines to lose the wager either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Firstly, the bet involved two divine artifacts. Losing them would be a blow even to Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Secondly, today was Godfather's eightieth birthday celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Augustines lost to the Rosenthals from Yalynch on Godfather's birthday, it would be a massive reputational hit for both the Godfather and the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't want to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the fight between Lance and Aresta intensified, their expressions grew grimmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lance is losing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just not quite strong enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone capable of fighting has already fought. What are we going to do now?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
