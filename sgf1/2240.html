        <h1>Chapter 2214 On the Way</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Sanctum of Sun, in the spacious hall, a group of people stood in front of Osborne, who was seated on the highest throne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This so-called Sanctum of Sun was actually the former Sanctum of Light, which had been devastated in the intense battle between Anita and Icy One and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the war, Anita had managed to make a quick repair of the sanctum. Although its power had waned to that of an ordinary divine artifact, its exterior still looked magnificent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She decided to rename it the Sanctum of Sun and established it as the power hub of the Empire of the Sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro asked, his face lined with worry, "Osborne, are you really in such a rush to leave? The situation on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet isn't completely stable yet. If you all leave now, I'm afraid there'll be chaos among the various factions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded, looking straight into Jethro's worried eyes, "Grandpa! Now that we've got a clue about my parents, I have to go after them! Every day we delay puts them in greater danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood only too well the urgency in Osborne's words. After all, Osborne's mother was his daughter, and he couldn't help but feel on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, his voice filled with determination, "Don't fret about </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet while I'm away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll leave a hundred Spatial Clones behind to keep everything in order. If those factions try to cause a ruckus, it'll just give me more of a reason to crush them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a menacing glint flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we're gone, I'll need you and Grandpa Sebastian to run things for the Empire of the Sun. You're the ones I trust the most, and I know you're up to the task."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast a glance at his grandfather, Sebastian, who gave a nod of agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian urged, "Osborne, this puny </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet isn't your real home! Your destiny lies in the vast expanse of the cosmos! So go out there and make your name!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't forget to bring your parents back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll look after the Empire of the Sun while you're gone. We'll be right here waiting for you to come back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was overcome with gratitude for their support. "I promise, Grandpa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to the group behind him&mdash;Isa, Emma, Austin, Anita, and others, including Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Kendra, Bryce, Diana, and Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of resolve washed over him. They would accompany him off </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet, setting off first for </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet and then for Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's roll!" Osborne announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded in assent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take care, folks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay safe!" they responded in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the group stepped out of the Sanctum of Sun and boarded the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum shot up into the sky and swiftly disappeared from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, not too far away, a figure stood stock-still, watching the rapidly vanishing Ascending Sacred Sanctum with a face contorted in pain and remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the God of Time&mdash;or rather, Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the God of Time had released Ophelia's consciousness, and the two had merged into one. The God of Time was now Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered to herself, "Racial Convergence Planet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm so sorry! I know I messed up before, but now... no matter what I do, you probably won't ever forgive me, will you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't show my face and bug you again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But... I'm going to Racial Convergence Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll cross paths there again, but this time... I'll be someone brand-new for you to get to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait for me! I'm not giving up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ophelia's figure vanished from the spot, and in the vast expanse of the starry sky, a new silhouette emerged, heading toward the distant Racial Convergence </span><span>Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere inside the Ascending Sacred Sanctum was buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe had cornered Isa, her eyes bright with eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. </span><span>Bowin</span><span>, I feel like my progress has hit a wall lately! Is there anything else you can teach me?" she asked, her voice filled with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah had latched onto Austin, her expression serious. "Austin, what can I do to level up my life power to your level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Anastasia and Kendra were crowding around Emma. "Emma, can you let us experience your death power?" they chimed in, curiosity sparkling in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Mila were also pestering Clarissa. "Is it true that your fate power can really change destiny?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst all this chatter, Bryce stood beside Osborne, watching the lively scene unfold with a mix of frustration and discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to ignore the fact that all these girls were fawning over Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had once tried to pursue Zoe, only to be flatly rejected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he had learned to keep his distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Bryce's glum expression, Osborne chuckled. "Bryce, you really need to find yourself a girlfriend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce shot him a look of exasperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Staying around you makes it impossible to find a girl! Once we hit Racial Convergence Planet, I'm planning to take off for a while and explore on my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked in surprise but nodded eventually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That sounds like a plan! With your talent, you'll definitely attract some big names on Racial Convergence Planet. Just be careful, and I'm sure you'll grow quickly&mdash;and maybe even find a girlfriend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's face lit up with a grin. "Absolutely! You're my role model! I'll be like you and find myself a few wives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the chatter around them fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previously animated group of girls turned to Bryce with expressions of disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bad man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Player!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not a good guy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Kendra, Bryce's sister, chimed in, shaking her head, "Bryce, I'm not against you having multiple wives, but could you not say that in front of us? It's just too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce bristled at the comments. "What do you mean, player?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Osborne not one? I'm just trying to follow his example!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra laughed. "Are you really going to compare yourself to Osborne? Why don't you compare your strength instead? He's already at Ascension Seven, and you're still stuck at Ascension Two... and let's not forget, he's been the one providing you with all the resources!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, you'd probably still be a Junior Deity, at best an Intermediate Deity..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce fell silent, the weight of her words sinking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls resumed their lively discussions, leaving him to stew in his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot a resentful glance at Osborne and whispered, "Hey, you're not going to step in? </span><span>Your girls are bullying me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave an eye-roll. "Cut that out! Kendra's your sister, not my girlfriend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I reckon she's more than happy about it... you're just being a chicken!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And it's not just Kendra! Mila, Diana, Hannah, and even Anastasia and Zoe&mdash;they're all smitten with you! Just show a bit of interest, and they'll be eating out of your hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's envy grew even stronger. "Osborne, you're really something special, aren't you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes popped in shock. "Bryce, don't you ever say that again! If you keep this up, I might just have to punch some sense into you! And for the record, Anastasia and Zoe are my sisters!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Real sisters?" Bryce retorted, a smirk creeping across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot him a dirty look, trying hard to hold back his annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce let out a chuckle and fell quiet, but he was even more set on leaving the group and making it on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we reach Racial Convergence Planet, I'm definitely out of here!" he decided silently.</span></p></div>
