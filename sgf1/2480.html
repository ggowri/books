        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He carefully examined Clara's face and suddenly realized. "You're Clara from Zephyr State, right? Sorry, I didn't expect you to be the genius participating in the Zone Duel. Your Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> can be exchanged for 791,000 Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara nodded in confirmation and pointed at Osborne, saying, "All the Sacred Crystals I get from the pledge will be handed over to him to handle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Leroy also took out her badge and said, "Then I'll pledge my Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's badge displayed 708,100 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the City Duel, she was injured due to the backlash from the Sacred Artifact and ultimately couldn't face Clara, securing only third place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, her Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> were exactly 1,000 points less than Clara's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man said, "You're Leroy from Zephyr State? No problem! All your Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> can be used as a pledge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy nodded and replied, "The Sacred Crystal I pledge will also be handled by him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt extremely surprised at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out that Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> could actually be pledged at the Phantom Commerce Guild. This was essentially a form of borrowing. If repayment couldn't be made within a certain period, the Phantom Commerce Guild would directly acquire their Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theoretically, Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> and Sacred Crystal can be exchanged at a 1:1 ratio, but in reality, their value far exceeds this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For many factions, Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> are far more important than Sacred Crystal because they can be used to exchange for rare treasures in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These treasures are nearly impossible to buy, no matter how much money is spent outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne couldn't help but feel grateful to Leroy and Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he also took out his badge and said, "In that case, I'll pledge my Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's badge had over a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the State </span><span>Duel</span><span> champion, he directly earned one million </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. The City </span><span>Duel</span><span> champion gets ten thousand points, while the Sect Tournament champion gets one hundred points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This action completely shocked the middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a million </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> meant Osborne was the State </span><span>Duel</span><span> champion. However, among the hundred states in Eastern Zone 3, he knew every champion but had no idea who Osborne was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After carefully examining him, a look of surprise appeared on his face. "You're Osborne, the State </span><span>Duel</span><span> champion of Zephyr State? Sorry, I didn't recognize you earlier. It seems you've changed quite a bit since the State Duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile without offering much explanation. "Now, please place all the Sacred Crystals we three pledged, along with these 300,000 Sacred Crystals, all on me. I bet on myself to win the championship!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, the middle-aged man immediately widened his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although many people would bet on themselves to win at the casino, like Valentino from Rose Rebels or Brenda from </span><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion, their bets were relatively small, usually not exceeding 100,000 Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They did this more to show confidence to the outside world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne actually placed a bet of nearly a million Sacred Crystals on himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Leroy, and Clara's combined Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> could be mortgaged for 2,427,300 Sacred Crystals, plus the 300,000 Sacred Crystals the three gathered, making Osborne's total bet over 2.7 million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne ultimately wins the championship, with odds of 1 to 100, he will earn over 270 million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This number is simply too massive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the Phantom Commerce Guild, two or three hundred million Sacred Crystals might not be much, but for the casino under their banner, it's still a huge fortune.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man looked serious but eventually nodded. "No problem! We are a casino under the Phantom Commerce Guild; no matter how much you bet, we can handle it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he quickly got to work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the bet was placed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne bet over 2.7 million Sacred Crystals, while Leroy and Clara each bet 20,000 Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing all this, Osborne left the casino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A determined expression appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was a bet of over 2.7 million Sacred Crystals; he absolutely couldn't accept failure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he had to win the Zone </span><span>Duel</span><span> championship no matter what.</span></p></div>
