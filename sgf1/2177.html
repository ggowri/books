        <h1>Chapter 2165 Seven Helpers-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! I thought you were some big shot. Turns out you're just a useless wimp who can only rely on an Apex divine artifact!" the God of Light said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Tyrese just laughed it off. "Hey, if I've got an Apex divine artifact, why not use it? When our cultivation levels are about the same, it's only natural to use such a powerful tool to settle the score. And I'm not stopping you from using one either...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! Right! I almost forgot your Apex divine artifact got smashed to pieces by Zayne a thousand years ago. Sure, you're back after reincarnation and even stronger than before, but I bet you haven't found a suitable Apex divine artifact yet, have you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Tyrese flashed a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his short stature, the huge knife he held didn't look the least bit comical. Anyone who saw Tyrese at that moment could feel the sharp killing intent and edge that suddenly radiated from him as he grasped the weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an Apex divine artifact no less powerful than the Ninefold Heaven's Tower. Even on the Racial Convergence Planet, it was considered top-grade, and on Celestara Planet, it was simply unrivaled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without the Apex divine artifact knife, he could hold off the attacks of the God of Time. Now that Tyrese had it in his hand, he was dead certain he could defeat the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese said with confidence, "Let's have it out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zayne always told me that the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community were incredibly talented. It's a pity I couldn't meet them all. But it's still pretty cool to face you, the God of Time, and have a go at you. Now, show me all you've got!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tyrese gave the knife a fierce shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a terrifying blade-light flashed and vanished in the blink of an eye. The next second, it appeared right in front of the God of Time and struck her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time staggered backward, her face pale and her lips tightly pursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese also possessed time power and had infused it into his attack. She hadn't even had time to dodge. Although the terrifying blade-light hadn't completely broken through her defenses, it had still posed a huge threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just one random attack is this powerful... I'm in for a tough fight today. But if you think you can beat me, you're dreaming! The Human Community is under the protection of the God of Night. I'll stand guard here until the God of Night shows up! Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time launched an attack on her own initiative. She knew time power wouldn't work well against Tyrese, so she didn't waste her energy on it and instead unleashed her divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a terrifying battle erupted. Two Supernal Deity Kings at the peak of Ascension Seven were now locked in a fierce fight in mid-air. The terrifying blade-lights and sharp fist-powers clashed violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a radius of about 60 miles of their battle, no one dared to stay for fear of being blasted to bits by the aftershocks of their fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Icy One, a warrior at the same Ascension Seven cultivation level, didn't dare to get close to the battle area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So strong! Both the God of Time and Tyrese are incredibly powerful! We're all at Ascension Seven, so why is there such a huge gap in our strength? And did Tyrese show up because the esteemed Lord Malevolence doesn't trust us and thinks we can't break through the Human Community in the West Zone? That's why he brought in a friend from the Racial Convergence Planet to help out?"</span></p></div>
