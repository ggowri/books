        <h1>Chapter 1860 The Wrath of Seth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne surveyed the villa, taking in its location at the heart of the Hudson family territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Tristan and his father were core members of this prestigious lineage, likely part of the main bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family was a sprawling entity like the Augustine family of Blue Planet. Beyond the main bloodline in Newport City, the Augustine family boasted numerous branch lines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Hudson family was larger in scale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over five million members across its main and branch lines, about three million resided in the Hudson Valley, while the other two million were scattered&mdash;some stationed at the border, others working in the mines, and many more spread across various family enterprises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that at its peak, the Hudson family had over 10 million members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that glory was long gone, and the family had suffered greatly, especially at the hands of the Dark Deity Legion, which had claimed nearly a million lives in recent years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan burst through the villa's grand entrance, urgency in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad! Are you okay? I brought him! Dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, still hanging on!" Seth's weak reply came, but the tone quickly shifted to one of fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring him here! I want to see him now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, caught off guard, felt a mix of confusion and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Tristan's father sounds weak&mdash;he must be seriously injured. But didn't Tristan acquire the white Miracle Elixir? Why hasn't it healed him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why is there such anger in his voice?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it directed at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furrowing his brow, Osborne followed Tristan into the room, where he found Seth lying on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight made him frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man looked incredibly frail, not from physical wounds but from the reckless use of the Hudson family's forbidden technique, which had drained his life force to a dangerously low level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's estimation, if nothing changed, Seth had no more than half an hour left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization puzzled Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Tristan, concern etched on his face. "Tristan, where's the white Miracle Elixir? Why hasn't your dad recovered? He doesn't look like he's taken it at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't shake the suspicion that Tristan had hesitated to give the elixir to his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were true, his respect for Tristan would plummet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "No matter how precious the elixir is, it can't compare to his father's life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan bit his lip, his eyes glistening with unshed tears, but he remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's frown deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his mouth to speak again when he noticed Seth staring intently at him, Seth's expression shifting from weakness to a growing fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore!" Seth's voice erupted in a hoarse growl, filled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for his frail state, Osborne would have sworn he was about to leap out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What's happening? Why is Tristan's father so furious at me? It looks like he wants to kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've finally found you, Theodore!" Seth continued, his eyes burning with intensity, his finger trembling as it pointed at Osborne, teeth clenched in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Osborne and Tristan stood frozen, shock evident on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if struck by a bolt of lightning, Osborne's body jolted as a memory resurfaced. He looked at Tristan's father with disbelief, piecing together the implications of Seth's fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice trembled as he spoke, "You... you know me? No, wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I mean is, do you know 'Theodore'? Do you recognize this face? Who are you? How do you know 'Theodore'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anxiety surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was currently using his father's youthful appearance and name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Tristan's dad recognized him sent a jolt of excitement through Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his words left Seth momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what do you mean?" Seth managed to stammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not one to miss a beat, Seth quickly pieced together what Osborne was implying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're saying you're not 'Theodore'? This face of yours is a disguise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth's brow furrowed tightly, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "Then what's your connection to 'Theodore'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, but determination replaced his uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had finally stumbled upon crucial information about his father and wasn't about to let it slip away. "That's right! 'Theodore' is my alias! This face is a disguise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath, locking eyes with Seth. "Theodore Augustine is actually my dad. This face? It's how he looked when he was younger. My name is Osborne Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words left his lips, he studied Seth's reaction, hoping to glean some insight from Seth's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth was left speechless, staring at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a blank stare, he fixated on Osborne, his body trembling violently. His cheeks flushed a deep red, the color of either intense fury or overwhelming exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth stuttered, his voice quaking, "You... you're Theodore's son? Then... what's your mother's name? What's her name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her name is Vivienne Hudson," Osborne replied, his heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan gasped, "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really her!" Seth exclaimed, disbelief etched across his face.</span></p></div>
