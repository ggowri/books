        <h1>Chapter 2615 Forces</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even top-tier Empyrean Sacredness warriors like Weston, Quinn, and Naomi were now gazing coldly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their eyes burned with naked killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the once noisy crowd around them quickly fell silent. Everyone sensed the unusual atmosphere. Then, all eyes turned to Osborne, with a hint of mockery flickering in their gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, this time you're probably in trouble!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three days ago, in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, Osborne's performance in the arena made his name resound throughout the Glorious Divine Kingdom, becoming an idol in countless hearts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, his rise to fame was built upon the humiliation of the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rose by trampling on the dignity of the Royal Family, completely crushing their honor and prestige, leaving every member utterly humiliated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They naturally wouldn't show Osborne a friendly face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for Callista's order forbidding anyone from acting against Osborne and his companions, with violators to be expelled from the Palace, they would have likely already taught Osborne a lesson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, when Osborne appears, these princes and princesses still won't make things easy for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A powerful aura erupted from them, directly pressing toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy beside Osborne instantly turned pale, their bodies trembling slightly as if they might collapse to their knees at any moment, barely holding on by clenching their teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite their recent surge in strength, compared to these princes and princesses who are at least at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection level, the gap in cultivation level is simply too vast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, three of them are even at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It&rsquo;s already remarkable that they managed to stay standing without kneeling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne remained calm as usual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing the cold stares of the princes and princesses, he not only didn&rsquo;t back down but stared straight back, his eyes showing no fear or panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene left the princes and princesses stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Interesting!" Naomi sneered. "Facing our oppressive aura, he remains unfazed and completely unaffected! He even dares to meet our gaze without a trace of fear or panic in his eyes. Just for this, he&rsquo;s far stronger than Seraphina."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she voluntarily withdrew her oppressive aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because she understood that such oppression had no effect on Osborne and was merely a waste of effort.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!" Quinn snorted coldly. "This kid is indeed strange! He hasn&rsquo;t even reached Empyrean Sacredness yet possesses such strength, something even we couldn&rsquo;t achieve back then! He must be hiding secrets. I really want to capture him and torture him to uncover his secrets!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, Queen Callista forbids us from taking action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But that doesn't mean we can never touch him. Once he enters that place and comes out, he will lose his value. By then, I will crush him like a bug!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a trace of ferocious killing intent flashed across Quinn's face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston merely smiled faintly. "He has brought shame to our Royal Family, and indeed he deserves a lesson to understand that before Empyrean Sacredness, he is nothing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel is held once every ten years, and each time a champion is crowned. But how many of these champions truly rise? Most end up merely as guards for the Royal Family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Weston revealed a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Weston, you're absolutely right," Naomi added with a smile. "The champion of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel is nothing special! Unless he reaches Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, he might barely catch my interest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But he clearly doesn't have that chance anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He has brought such disgrace to our Royal Family, he is destined to die in Necropolis City! The moment he comes out of there will be his end!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The group chatted casually, having already sentenced Osborne to death in their hearts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Seraphina walked toward Osborne with a cold expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne!" she said in a low voice, her tone filled with burning determination, "I will soon break through to Empyrean Sacredness! Once I do, let's fight again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will personally defeat you and take back everything I lost!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "I warned you not to mess with me, but since you're so insistent, I won't hold back! Better bring your brother along too, that'll make it more interesting!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina was instantly enraged upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She roared, "Osborne, you're too arrogant! Before, my brother wasn't around, so I let it slide when you said such things. But now that he's nearby, you still dare to be so cocky? You're done for!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, completely unfazed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at Hendrix in the distance, a trace of coldness flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix's strength had also reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Enough, quiet!" At that moment, Aiden appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was dressed in combat gear, clearly ready to enter Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cultivation level was only at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many princes and princesses present had cultivation levels not inferior to his, and some even far surpassed it. However, as his words fell, everyone shut their mouths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because they knew Aiden represented Callista.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Frederick rarely handling affairs, Callista was the highest authority in the Palace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one dared to defy Aiden's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aiden said, "Emperor Frederick, Queen Callista, and several other lords are about to arrive! Everyone, stay silent!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Aiden finished speaking, he silently stood aside and waited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, everyone turned their gaze toward the deeper part of the Palace, sensing an extremely terrifying aura surging from there, approaching this way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moments later, several figures appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leading at the front was still Frederick. However, at this moment, he had taken off the exceedingly luxurious royal attire and changed into a set of dark brown Panoply Armor. Except for his eyes, his entire body was tightly wrapped in this dark brown battle armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this armor, Osborne couldn't help but freeze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a Supreme Sacred Artifact armor!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, its aura far surpasses that of ordinary Supreme Sacred Artifacts, even unmatched by all the treasures in the Royal Treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression grew increasingly grave. The dark brown armor was covered with dark red spots, each exuding a chilling aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is the blood of some powerful creature!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "What a terrifying armor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Its defense must be invincible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne's gaze shifted to the person beside Frederick, who was also wearing armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is Callista!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The aura of the armor on Callista, though slightly inferior to Frederick's, is undoubtedly a top masterpiece among the Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this armor appeared in the Royal Treasury, Osborne wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to trade all his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints for it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These two are well-prepared!" Osborne murmured to himself, feeling unprecedented pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was already immensely powerful, being one of the three Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness on the entire Racial Convergence Planet. Now, clad in such a terrifying Panoply Armor, almost no one could rival him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Can Ms. Alba handle an Emperor Frederick like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued to look behind them. Next appeared a group of Palace warriors, all clad in Panoply Armor, their faces full of killing intent, numbering as many as three hundred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And all three hundred of them were at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. The Panoply Armor they wore were all Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three hundred Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors were a terrifying force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression grew even heavier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he finally saw Adriana's figure.</span></p></div>
