        <h1>Chapter 2606 Revealing the Secret-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I also know that it holds great opportunities, possibly even the secret to quickly breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness! Of course, it's also extremely dangerous, and even the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom can't accomplish certain things alone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's why Emperor Frederick invited supreme warriors from other forces to enter Necropolis City together. If his strength were strong enough, he definitely wouldn't reveal the secrets of Necropolis City to us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, there seems to be a special area in Necropolis City that only those below Empyrean Sacredness can enter. And there, the key to uncovering Necropolis City's secrets might be hidden."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only by finding that item can the secrets of Necropolis City be unlocked and its opportunities obtained."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Other than that, I don't know much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head after listening and thought, "Ms. Alba knows even less about Necropolis City than I do."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This won't do!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Necropolis City is full of dangers. If she knows nothing about it, she could easily be used by Frederick or even lose her life there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He whispered, "Ms. Alba, Necropolis City is actually where the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet rose to power!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Adriana jolted. "What did you say?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked shocked, her eyes narrowing slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne replied, "Necropolis City is where the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet rose to power. At that time, the Overpowering Dynasty ruled the Racial Convergence Planet, and the beings there suffered under oppression. Until the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet suddenly emerged, the twelve supreme warriors defeated and destroyed the Overpowering Dynasty in one fell swoop, shaping the current structure of the Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Few people know why the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet were so powerful. But I do! They gained their strength in Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Necropolis City hides a huge secret!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And this secret has always been controlled by the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. Their exploration and research of Necropolis City have lasted for tens of thousands of years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick's high-profile announcement to lead people into Necropolis City is likely because he has found a way to harness its power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, he might quickly break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, can the Fairy Moon Sect withstand him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Adriana's eyes narrowed sharply, and her breathing became rapid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long time, she finally spoke, "Osborne, if your information is true, it means so much to me. Once Emperor Frederick breaks through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, not only will the Fairy Moon Sect be unable to oppose him, but even the Evernight Court and Phantom Commerce Guild will face trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It seems our most important task in Necropolis City this time is to stop Emperor Frederick from obtaining its power and prevent his breakthrough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A trace of ruthlessness flashed in Adriana's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Frederick breaks through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, his first move will undoubtedly be to force her. If she refuses to marry Frederick, he will mercilessly kill her and destroy the Fairy Moon Sect to eliminate any threat to the Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana quickly said, "Osborne, I have some important matters to handle. Stay in Nebula City, and contact me with the Star Token if anything comes up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, she hurriedly left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, she was going to prepare a countermeasure. In the past, although she knew Necropolis City was full of dangers and opportunities, she hadn't paid much attention to it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, after learning the true origin of Necropolis City, she naturally needed to make more preparations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was precisely why Osborne told her the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne worried that relying on his strength alone, he couldn't stop Frederick's plan in Necropolis City, nor prevent him from breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the gap in strength between him and Frederick was too great.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Adriana added, their chances of success would be much higher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, even if Adriana's strength was slightly inferior to Frederick's, the gap wouldn't be too large. With Adriana's help at a critical moment, things would become much easier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pondered seriously, "However, this still isn't secure enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emperor Frederick, since he dared to bring powerful figures like Adriana into Necropolis City, must have not only intended to leverage their strength but also considered the possibility of them competing with him for opportunities. He must have made preparations..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, a day passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne woke up Clara and Leroy; it was time to head to the treasury of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p></div>
