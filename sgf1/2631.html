        <h1>Chapter 2518 Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne and Flash were resting, mainly because Flash couldn't hold on anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasn't tired at all, and his Sacred Power was still at its peak. He could jump into a new battle right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Flash was already exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a battle maniac, the moment he heard about a fight, he got excited. If his opponent was weak, he wouldn't be happy and would even complain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, he had obviously become numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For seven days, Flash and Osborne had been fighting those advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons. The key was that Flash had to stay at the front, endure their attacks, and create opportunities for Osborne to take them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, his defense was stronger than Osborne's, making him more resilient, but his attack power was weaker, and his killing efficiency was far inferior to Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So for these seven days, Flash was basically taking a beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although those advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons couldn't truly deal him fatal damage, constantly getting hit and injured made him naturally unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Flash rested to regain his strength while looking at Osborne with a resentful gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile and comforted Flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "The Phantomagic Realm will only exist for a month. Ten days have already passed. Once it disappears, you won't even have the chance to experience battles."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are the strongest of the Beast Clan. You were born for battle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're strong, only you can do it this well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, Osborne's praise was endless. Finally, he managed to calm Flash down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne took out a jadeflare vial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside was the sparkling Legendary Dragon Elixir, a full hundred drops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And these were their gains from the past seven days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, they collected two hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir in just three days. But afterward, it took them seven days to gather only one hundred drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons were indeed much harder to deal with than the mid Empyrean Sacredness ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Against mid Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons, Osborne could almost wipe them all out with the Arrow Storm of Earth Arrow. Even if some remained, they would be swiftly dealt with by Flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons, Osborne could only kill about a hundred with a single Arrow Storm. He needed to cast Arrow Storm multiple times to eliminate them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was somewhat dissatisfied with this speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Should I use Heaven Arrow next? If I do, my speed of obtaining Dragon Elixir will definitely increase! But every time I use Heaven Arrow, I have to wait half an hour before I can use it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I encounter danger during this time, I'll have one less trump card!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forget it! In this separate illusionary space, there is no danger, except from the Illusionary Heavenly Demons. So, I don't need to keep Heaven Arrow as a card!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne made a decision and immediately stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, let's move on! It's already the tenth day. Maybe in a few days, this independent illusionary space will disappear. By then, you won't have such a good chance to fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash immediately got up, filled with fighting spirit again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, a loud boom echoed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing the advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons, Osborne used Heaven Arrow for the first time. The terrifying Heaven Arrow instantly crushed and obliterated most of the three thousand Illusionary Heavenly Demons, showcasing its immense and terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Osborne's Earth Arrow's Arrow Storm and Flash's Dragon's Breath, the remaining Illusionary Heavenly Demons didn't last long and were quickly dealt with.</span></p></div>
