        <h1>Chapter 2495 Repairs</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced at Angela in surprise. "You can repair the Cosmic Translocator?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He, who mastered spatial power, knew nothing about the Cosmic Translocator because he simply didn&rsquo;t have the time to learn. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For him, improving his cultivation level was far more important than learning to set up or repair the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now Osborne felt that maybe he should </span><span>rethink that</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, if he </span><span>ran into such</span><span> a situation again and couldn't repair or set it up, he would have to travel across vast starry distances to find </span><span>another one</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That would be a huge waste of time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even worse, if Osborne entered an area with no Cosmic Translocator and couldn't set one up, he might end up trapped there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the cosmos </span><span>wa</span><span>s vast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The distance between Stellar Regions </span><span>was</span><span> incredibly vast. Without a Cosmic Translocator, even with a Supreme Sacred Artifact battleship, it would take an unimaginably long time traverse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even ordinary people on Blue Planet kn</span><span>e</span><span>w this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>There was a time when</span><span> I hit a bottleneck. My cultivation level just wouldn't break through. My master suggested I learn something else to </span><span>take my mind off  it</span><span>. So, I spent some time learning how to repair Cosmic Translocators.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luckily, I have decent talent. </span><span>I got the knack of it</span><span>! And afterward, my cultivation level naturally broke through," Angela said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and asked, "If you have time, could you teach me? Of course, if this is a Fairy Moon Sect secret, just pretend I never asked."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela instantly </span><span>gave him a strange look</span><span> upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's not a secret! Besides, Ms. Alba said that if you're interested in Fairy Moon Sect's skills, no matter what it is, we can teach you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was surprised that Adriana had actually said something like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew very well that major powers highly valued their own skills and would never share them easily. Even their own disciples had to pass various tests to be taught.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, Adriana actually promised that as long as Osborne was interested, he could learn any Fairy Moon Sect skill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She really thought highly of him and treated him so well!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He </span><span>made a mental note of</span><span> her kindness to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>I</span><span> haven't fully mastered </span><span>the method</span><span> myself, so I'm afraid I can't teach you. However, I can organize and transfer what I've learned to you through Memory Transfer. This might be somewhat helpful to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, you have spatial power. You can completely set up the Cosmic Translocator on your own! Later, I'll have Ms. Alba send over all the Fairy Moon Sect's study materials on setting up the Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed and quickly thanked Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled faintly, "Alright! Let's hurry down and take a look! These people are probably trying to go deeper into Stellar Region M72, but they're stuck here because the Cosmic Translocator is damaged."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I hope this Cosmic Translocator isn't too badly damaged. If it can't be repaired, we might have to turn back</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span>aking a detour would take too long. I don't mind, but you definitely won't make it back in time within six months to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, </span><span>hoping</span><span> that the Cosmic Translocator wasn't too severely damaged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the people down there had clearly been </span><span>t</span><span>here for a while. With so many gathered, there must be some skilled individuals among them, yet the Cosmic Translocator still hadn't been repaired after all this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, it's in bad shape!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela piloted the Mid-grade Sacred Artifact warship, descending toward the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once they got close enough</span><span>, she put away the warship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, this was a highly valuable</span><span> </span><span>Mid-grade Sacred Artifact warship. She couldn't </span><span>risk drawing unwanted attention</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, someone might get greedy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took an Inferior Sacred Artifact warship from the Warfare Ancient Tree, removed the skull flag on it, and then the</span><span> three of them</span><span> slowly descended.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The people on the resource-bearing planet had already spotted them from afar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their gazes revealed scrutiny.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, they meant no harm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the three of them landed not far from the Cosmic Translocator and </span><span>surveyed</span><span> the crowd around them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people were clearly not </span><span>from a single faction</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed they belonged to at least five or six different factions. While the</span><span>y were</span><span> </span><span>not hostile</span><span>, they remained cautious of each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strongest group among them had six advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other factions each had only one or two advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were a total of thirteen advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye thoroughly assessed the strength of these hundreds of people around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were over fifty mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their aura was slightly stronger than the mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors of the Skull Pirates Osborne encountered before, but their strength wasn't much greater. They posed no threat to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he feared were those twelve advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Fortunately, they don't belong to the same faction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors from the largest faction flew over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was an old man. He glanced at Osborne, Angela, and Agatha, then fixed his gaze on Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, he regarded Angela, who had already reached mid Empyrean Sacredness, as their leader.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "Hello, are you also planning to use the Cosmic Translocator to enter the depths of Stellar Region M72?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela nodded. "Yes! What's wrong with the Cosmic Translocator here? Is it </span><span>bad</span><span>? Can it still be fixed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man smiled and nodded. "Whether it can be fixed depends on you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me introduce myself first. I am the Elder and Deputy Island Master of Cobalt Island. I know how to repair the Cosmic Translocator. Currently, I am working hard to fix it! However, I am still </span><span>short on</span><span> some resources.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're here just in time. Here's the resource list. If you can provide these resources, the Cosmic Translocator can be fixed! If not, you'll just have to keep waiting!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he handed a list to Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While she was checking, he said, "We all want to fix the Cosmic Translocator as soon as possible, but the required resources can't come solely from the people of Cobalt Island! Each of you must contribute!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you have these resources, I hope you'll bring them out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela quickly </span><span>r</span><span>eview</span><span>ed</span><span> the resource list.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, her expression turned a bit grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne noticed something was off with Angela and curiously asked, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't answer, just handed him the resource list to see for himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took it and quickly glanced through it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, </span><span>his brows furrowed slightly. He</span><span> looked at the old man, and asked, "Are you sure </span><span>it takes so many resources to </span><span>repair the Cosmic Translocator? </span><span>I wo</span><span>n't</span><span> question most of it</span><span>, but ten million Sacred Crystal? Is Sacred Crystal </span><span>required</span><span> for repairing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man glanced at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're just a junior who hasn't even broken through to Empyrean Sacredness. You know nothing. Can you repair the Cosmic Translocator? Right now, only the deputy island master of Cobalt Island can fix it! If he says these resources are needed, then that's it! Just hand them over!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, no one gets to use the Cosmic Translocator! You can all get lost!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man looked arrogant.</span></p></div>
