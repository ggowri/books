        <h1>Chapter 2276 Dispelling Doubts-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to this, Osborne looked at Adriana expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the top-ranked experts in the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom and even the Racial Convergence Planet, Adriana's power level far surpassed Osborne's. Saying she could kill him with a glance might be an exaggeration, but crushing him with a finger would definitely be effortless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana should have a deep understanding of how to merge different powers and strengthen Sacred Power, which might solve the problems Osborne was currently facing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his question seemed to startle Adriana for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Osborne questioningly and said, "Don't you already possess Sacred Power? You should have already solved this kind of problem yourself. Why are you asking me this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was instantly a little embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking about it, he finally said, "Actually, the reason I was able to gain Sacred Power ahead of time was by using a shortcut. I... have a special item that allows me to merge two powers with different attributes, which is why I was able to gain Sacred Power so early."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana was even more taken aback. "There's something that special? Is it some kind of unique Sacred Artifact?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sort of," Osborne replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't elaborate because the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was his well-kept secret. It was better not to let others know he'd fully merged with the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could say for sure that Adriana wouldn't be tempted if she knew about the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity? Given her strength, even though he'd fully integrated with the Lotus, she might still be able to forcefully rip it away, split it up, and claim it for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne chose to be deliberately vague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana was smart enough to realize Osborne wasn't being entirely upfront, but she didn't press the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head, lost in thought, and then a smile spread across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana said, "You got your Sacred Power early thanks to a special thing, and now you're asking questions like this... So, I'm thinking you wanted to use that special thing to keep combining more powers, but you hit a roadblock and haven't found a way around it, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Adriana in amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She can figure that out too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only nod truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana said calmly, "You're barking up the wrong tree!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your talent, even without that special thing, you should have no trouble merging powers and getting your Sacred Power early. So, if you want to merge more powers and make your Sacred Power even stronger, you shouldn't pour all your energy and time into upgrading that special thing. Instead, you should... rely on your own abilities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rely on myself?" Osborne was floored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a bolt of lightning had zapped his brain, clearing away the fog of confusion and paving a new way when the old one seemed blocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes lit up.</span><br><span>How could </span><span>he</span><span> not have thought of that?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've been busting my butt trying to find ways to improve the Fusion Vessel, thinking that if it gets stronger, it'll generate more foundational carriers, and then I can merge more powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But in fact... even without relying on the extraordinary abilities of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, with my talent, I can still merge powers and acquire Sacred Power ahead of schedule!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Leroy can do it! Clara can do it! Surely, I can do it too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> been overly reliant on the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He</span><span> was now consumed with regret. He had spent so much time and energy, wracking his brains for solutions, yet none of them had enabled the Fusion Vessel to produce a third foundational carrier.</span></p></div>
