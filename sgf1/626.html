        <h1>Chapter 626 Blood Energy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found the idea somewhat amusing. No. 1's speculation seemed entirely baseless to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he possibly be the progenitor of the Vampire lineage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The identity of the Vampire progenitor was a matter of many legends, with no consensus on the actual figure. In various mythologies, the progenitor was a different character altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most widely accepted candidate for the Vampire progenitor was Cain, the son of Adam and Eve from the Bible. Known as the first murderer, he was often regarded as the ancestor of all evil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, Cain was revered as the original Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts crossed Osborne's mind, his expression shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you certain that only the progenitor of Vampires could instill such overwhelming dread and fear in you, even as you wield the Vampire Transformation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 1 nodded resolutely. "Absolutely certain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thoughtful nod, Osborne touched his chest, where a relic believed to be a divine artifact&mdash;the Blood Cross of Cain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was this very cross that granted Osborne the power to transform into a Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this cross truly be the divine artifacts, the weapon of the Vampire progenitor Cain? Is it because of this cross that my transformation is so complete, so superior, and exerts such a formidable pressure upon them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne believed this to be the most plausible explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to test it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having already reverted from his Vampire </span><span>Transformation,</span><span> he was no longer a source of intimidation to those around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne channeled the power of the Blood Cross, not for transformation, but concentrating it between his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dense, blood-like force materialized instantly as if a drop of blood had formed in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment this appeared, everyone began to tremble violently, their eyes wide with terror, their knees buckling under an unseen weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this power?" No. 1 gasped in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was now certain; it wasn't his Vampire Transformation or his status as the progenitor that inspired fear, but the presence of...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross of Cain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the distress on their faces, Osborne was about to withdraw the power when he impulsively flicked his finger, sending the blood energy towards No. 1.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. 1, try to absorb this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 1's body was shaking, but the sight of the blood-like energy ignited an irresistible urge within him&mdash;to consume the drop of blood, to devour the power it held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Osborne's command, he hesitated no longer. He opened his mouth wide and swallowed the blood energy whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, his body convulsed with an even more intense transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body actively transformed into that of a Vampire shrouded in a rich blood-red light. Before Osborne's eyes, No. 1's fangs grew longer, his claws became sharper, and his aura became much stronger and weirder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it truly absorbable? And after absorbing the blood energy, he seems to have transformed more completely, with increased strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the blood-red glow around No. 1 faded, he looked at his transformation in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, I've grown stronger! My Vampire Transformation feels more complete, and my strength, speed, defense, and regenerative abilities have all significantly improved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, the others became excited, their eyes filled with anticipation as they turned to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger No. 1 became, the more valuable his assistance would be. Unfortunately, the Blood Cross's energy was not inexhaustible; otherwise, Osborne would have liked to empower everyone present with the blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing their eager gazes, Osborne felt a pang of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't look at me like that. This power doesn't belong to me but to the Blood Cross. Its energy is finite and is now integrated with my body. Once expended, it can be restored, but that takes time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words brought a wave of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to leave them disheartened, Osborne continued, "I can condense up to ten </span><span>drops of blood energy daily. More than that would detract from my strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will entrust these drops to No. 1 each day for distribution among you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement buzzed through the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could produce ten portions of blood energy daily in less than two months, each of them could receive a portion, refining their Vampire Transformation and enhancing their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, it wouldn't take that long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew a way to accelerate the Blood Cross's energy condensation, which was by devouring the life force and energy of his enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he transformed into a Vampire, his blood-red hair could absorb the strength and vital energy of his enemies, not only boosting his power but also rapidly replenishing and increasing the power of the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had made up his mind to make full use of this ability in the upcoming battles against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this resolution, Osborne addressed Number One with solemn determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. 1, your days of leisurely training are over. I want you to lead everyone to </span><span>Dampston</span><span> immediately and await my orders!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The war has already begun!"</span></p></div>
