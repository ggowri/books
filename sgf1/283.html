        <h1>Chapter 283 Evelyn's Guilt</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But actually, Evelyn had remained a virgin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years passed like that, and Ophelia's father suddenly passed away in an accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Evelyn no longer had to make strange noises shamelessly in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had planned to leave the Caldwell family just like that. At least she could get a large sum of money that would never be running out in her lifetime as long as she spent it frugally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she chose to stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn was hesitant to leave Ophelia despite being her stepmother, as Ophelia treated her more as a friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were like sisters, shopping and traveling together and even sharing many secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to stay and take care of Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, not long after, Ophelia fell in love, and her boyfriend was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia excitedly introduced Osborne to Evelyn immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn, recalling her first sight of Osborne, found him clean-cut and attractive, despite his orphan status, always exuding confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She did not tell Ophelia that her heart was pounding at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Osborne, and her eyes fixed on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia thought Evelyn was observing Osborne, but only Evelyn knew she'd fallen in love with him at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't say it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn envied Ophelia for having a boyfriend like Osborne, yet Evelyn married Ophelia's old father for money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only suppress her feelings, watching Ophelia and Osborne being affectionate, enduring the pain in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Osborne married Ophelia and became a son-in-law of the Caldwell family that Evelyn felt she should let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Ophelia's stepmother, and she couldn't compete with Ophelia for a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the more she suppressed herself, the more painful it became for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Evelyn started to make trouble for no reason. As a stepmother, she caused trouble for Osborne and bullied him in various ways, all in hopes that he would remember her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used this perverted way to vent her inner frustration of not being able to love someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia did not notice anything abnormal about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Evelyn discovered that everyone in the Caldwell family began to learn from her to target Osborne, bully Osborne, insult Osborne as waste, and say that he was not worthy of Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became more and more inferior and less and less confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ophelia began to dislike Osborne. Evelyn suddenly felt that she had another chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Ophelia could continue to dislike Osborne and divorce him, Osborne would be single again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, she would have a chance, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to this thought, she doubled her efforts to target Osborne, repeatedly badmouthing him to Ophelia, insinuating he was a disappointment who didn't deserve her and couldn't assist her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn recognized the injustice and shamelessness of the situation, but her suppressed emotions led her to no longer prioritize them. She aimed to break up Ophelia and Osborne, intending to compensate Osborne for his suffering gradually when they were together in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, she succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her efforts, Ophelia finally couldn't stand Osborne anymore and chose to divorce him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn was elated on the day of their divorce, celebrating in her room with a bottle of red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She packed Osborne's luggage and planned to remove him from the Caldwell family, then intended to leave to pursue Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But something unexpected happened then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After divorcing Ophelia, Osborne seemed like a different person, returning to the Caldwell family alone and asking for 20 million dollars in divorce compensation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne even controlled her and used her to threaten Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was most incredible to her was that in order to avenge her for targeting him over the years, Osborne pressed her down on the sofa and slapped her buttocks hard to humiliate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Evelyn's numb body was completely activated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, she was resisting, but in fact, she was highly excited and guided Osborne, who had gone mad because of hatred, into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she finally got what she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her years of feelings were finally released, and she finally became a woman, releasing her love unrestrainedly under the man she loved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, from then on, Osborne hated her profoundly and never gave her any chance to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, she had never shared her experiences and thoughts from over the years with anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, there was no chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn couldn't help but burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over the years, I have done many wrong things because of my perverted feelings. I have hurt Osborne and Ophelia. I was wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I've got my punishment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's better to die. If I die, I won't have to feel guilty or suffer anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least I had you once! I will never forget that time, even though you were... so rude!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia, I'm sorry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, I'm so sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears falling like raindrops, Evelyn slowly closed her eyes, ready to face death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch! Are you scared now? Well, crying won't help! You dared to hit and scold me, saying that I am not as good as Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crazy and ferocious, Wesley finally pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p></div>
