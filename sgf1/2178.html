        <h1>Chapter 2165 Seven Helpers-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's face turned ashen at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was nothing he could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither Tyrese nor the God of Time was someone he could take on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an intense exchange, Tyrese and the God of Time both retreated again, their faces looking a bit pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese said icily, "God of Time, I admit I underestimated you! Even when I used my Apex divine artifact battle-knife, I still couldn't take you down when you were bare-handed! If we had a fair fight, I'd probably lose to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" God of Time snorted. "You got that right! If you're smart, just get out of here. I don't want to kill anyone today. I'm just waiting for God of Night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Tyrese gave a faint smile. "Leave? No way! Zayne paid a price to have us come and back him up. How could we just leave like this? I may not be able to handle you, but you're not gonna make it out of here today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said that, God of Time's face hardened abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"'We'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah!" Tyrese grinned faintly. "Zayne didn't just hire me to help. I thought I could deal with you on my own, but it turned out I underestimated you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, no more hiding. Everyone, come out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get rid of these guys quickly and head back to Racial Convergence Planet. The celestial energy here is way thinner compared to that on Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Tyrese looked into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone laughed. "Tyrese, looks like you're not up to the task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were bragging before that you could take out this little girl all by yourself. But after all this fighting, even with your Apex divine artifact battle-knife, you still couldn't beat her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Newbie, you better train more when we get back to Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese's face darkened. "Humph! That's because this little girl is really strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She came back from the cycle of reincarnation in just a thousand years, with the experience and memories of two lifetimes. Plus, she has incredible talent. It's normal that I couldn't handle her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least, I'm not being stubborn. That's why I called you guys out, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese's words only made the laughter even louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a few figures suddenly appeared beside Tyrese, looking at God of Time with faint smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Including Tyrese, there were seven figures in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them had an energy signature no weaker than Tyrese's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them, whose energy was as vast as the sea, was even more powerful than Tyrese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time's face instantly turned extremely pale, with a hint of panic in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth and said, "Six Ascension Seven Supernal Deity Kings?! One Ascension Eight?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To deal with me, Lord Malevolence really spared no expense! He even got you guys from Racial Convergence Planet. It seems Lord Malevolence is dead-set on wiping out the Human Community on Celestara Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Tyrese smiled, "The Human Community on Celestara Planet? Just a low-class race. Your existence has been getting in the way of Zayne's plan to rebuild the Malevolence Empire. So, of course, you all have to be wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity God of Night isn't here. Otherwise, we'd really like to have a go at him and see how powerful this guy that Lord Malevolence fears actually is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, the seven of them stared at the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King said to her indifferently, "Little girl, I'll give you a chance. Surrender now, and I won't kill you. From now on, you can be my</span><span> maid and serve me well. I'll take you to Racial Convergence Planet, where you'll have better cultivation conditions and can reach a higher cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I'll have to be harsh and kill you. I wonder if you'll be lucky enough to come back from the cycle of reincarnation this time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, there was a clear threat on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a terrifying aura pressed down hard on the God of Time, making her face turn ashen.</span></p></div>
