        <h1>Chapter 2461 Humiliation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's voice was loud, making everyone fall silent instantly, and they all looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne still meditating with his eyes closed, many people let out mocking laughs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is Osborne trying to play dumb to get away with it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad, Brenda won't let him off. The more arrogant and cocky he was before, the more ridiculous he looks now. If I were him, I'd hand over the Bloodwrought Bow and Warfare Shield right now. Then, I'd hide away in shame!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Haha, you're absolutely right!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne probably never dreamed that Brenda would achieve so much. He might already be dumbfounded now, too scared to face Brenda."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's such a ridiculous and foolish guy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He set the bet, so he has to admit defeat and face the consequences. He should hand over the Warfare Shield and Bloodwrought Bow, then get lost!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd's chatter didn't affect Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne remained seated cross-legged with his eyes closed, as if everything around him had nothing to do with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Clara and Leroy saw everyone humiliating Osborne like that, they instantly became furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara gritted her teeth and shouted, "Shut up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you talk about Osborne like that? Brenda does have many achievements, but Osborne hasn't lost yet. And he won't lose!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said coldly, "That's right! You will lose. Acting so arrogant now only makes you look ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Clara and Leroy finished speaking, everyone burst into even louder laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I know you two, you're Clara and Leroy. It's said you tied for fourth place in the Zephyr State's state duel. But I've also heard that with your current skills, you're nowhere near the top ten in the state duel, and you don't qualify for the zone duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You only made it into the top ten because Osborne dragged you in by teaming up with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! You must have paid a lot to get Osborne to take you to the zone duel, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For example, your bodies?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hahaha. At this point, how dare you still speak up for Osborne? If I were you, I would have hidden away long ago!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What&rsquo;s wrong? Osborne doesn&rsquo;t dare to speak, so he sent two women to defend him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Does Osborne only know how to hide under two women's skirts? Haha. Is he even a man?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe he really enjoys hiding under your skirts?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing everyone's filthy words, Clara and Leroy's faces flushed with anger, feeling extremely furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as they were about to fight back, they felt a hand pressing on their shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finally opened his eyes. He stopped the furious Clara and Leroy, shielding them behind him, and coldly stared at those who spoke filthy words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Listen, do you dare to repeat what you just said?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a cold murderous intent flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, those who had been speaking became extremely nervous. They felt an inexplicable fear, and their bodies stiffened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They hesitated for a moment, seemingly wanting to fight back, but they found that the fear was so overwhelming they couldn't utter a single word.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They felt extremely panicked inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were glowing, like the fiercest beast staring at them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing those people stay silent, Osborne snorted coldly and looked at Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda said coldly, "Osborne, stop wasting time! Now only the three of you haven't submitted your data. Didn't you say I couldn't make it to the top three? So, do the three of you have greater achievements than me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Brenda looked very disdainful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, seeing my achievements and results, do you still dare to think that way? Are you regretting making that bet with me now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad, it's all too late now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think you'd better admit defeat and hand over the Warfare Shield and Bloodwrought Bow. That way, at least you won't feel so ashamed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Brenda crossed her arms over her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "Sorry, I never thought about giving up! Brenda, next, open your eyes wide and watch carefully..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne gave Leroy a look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Understanding Osborne's intention, Leroy immediately became excited and quickly walked out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll go tally the scores first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Leroy was already in front of Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at Leroy indifferently, not paying any attention. Leroy and Clara's abilities were considered the weakest among those in the zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, under normal circumstances, if they hadn't teamed up with Osborne, they wouldn't even have stood out in the state duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, no one cared about Clara and Leroy's performance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one believed they would achieve much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Leroy took out a Dimensional Bag and handed it to Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only one?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, someone sneered, "Just one Dimensional Bag. Even if she achieves something, it won't be much. At least she can't possibly threaten Brenda!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, she's the third-to-last to have her results tallied..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If her results can't surpass Brenda's, Brenda is at least guaranteed to be in the top three. By then, Osborne will have lost the bet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ridiculous."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As everyone whispered, only Ian could not hide his astonishment in front of Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well? Your Dimensional Bag looks quite special."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your level is really high!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian's words made everyone pause for a moment. Then, he looked at Brenda's Dimensional Bag. Sure enough, he noticed it was different from theirs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's Dimensional Bag seems to look of a higher level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, only Osborne was sneering, as these Dimensional Bags were personally crafted by him. With his current spatial power, creating Dimensional Bags was effortless for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Osborne made them casually, those Dimensional Bags were more advanced than the ones everyone else used, and their internal storage space was much larger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their storage space was at least a hundred times larger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, even though Leroy only took out one Dimensional Bag, it could hold more than what ten of the others' Dimensional Bags combined could carry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! So what if her Dimensional Bag is more advanced?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if her Dimensional Bag is bigger, what's the use if there aren't many achievements inside? Maybe her Dimensional Bag is empty," someone sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Leroy coldly said to the person speaking, "Is this Dimensional Bag empty? How ridiculous. Now, take a good look! See for yourself if my Dimensional Bag is really empty!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Leroy directly opened her Dimensional Bag and took everything out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud rumble, countless items surged out like a tide, covering half the sky. However, it didn&rsquo;t stop there&mdash;an endless stream of various resources and treasures continued pouring out from the Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Treasures were scattered everywhere, covering the land and sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A large number of Bloody Ivies, Abyssal Snakes' poison glands, Eaglebeak Moths' wings, Tigerstripe Bees' stingers, and Abyssal Snake Slough...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, the area was covered with hundreds of thousands of Ice Beetle corpses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this was still not the end. Ice Beetle corpses continued pouring out from the Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, everything around became incredibly quiet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone widened their eyes and opened their mouths, staring in disbelief at everything.</span></p></div>
