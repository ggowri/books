        <h1>Chapter 1088 Siege</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of terrified cries pierced the air, all coming from the outer sentries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the 30 thousand members of the Augustine family's team huddled together in fear, gazing into the inky darkness of the forest, feeling as if they were staring straight into the mouth of a ferocious beast ready to swallow them whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're here already?!" he exclaimed, shock creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sentries were elite Class AAA warriors, yet they'd fallen without even a warning, snuffed out like candles in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten screams echoed through the canyon, and then silence descended once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire lot of sentries had been taken out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravity of their situation began to settle in for Wesson. That meant their pursuers were definitely Class S, and there were likely plenty of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a cold chill cut through him as he surveyed the quiet woods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No sign of the enemy!" shouted one of the Augustine family members, activating their Satan's Eye to scan the area. Panic spread quickly as others began to echo the same sentiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't see anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the group reached a fever pitch as dread washed over them. Just the thought of hearing those screams without knowing where the enemy hid was truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's brow furrowed, a dreadful realization creeping into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it the Eityreia Organization attackers? It has to be them. Only Class S assassins from the Eityreia Organization could mask their presence so completely that not even our Satan's Eye can pick them up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Augustine family also realized that it was assassins from the Eityreia Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others began to murmur their fears aloud, and chaos threatened to break loose. Some were clamoring to flee, declaring they ought to scatter and escape as many as they could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson bellowed, his voice cutting through the rising panic, "Everyone, stay calm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen to me! We need to gather together! Those of you who are weaker, get in the center. The stronger fighters form a perimeter! This is a matter of life and death now, so no one panic! If we don't keep our wits about us, we're playing right into the enemy's hands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they want a fight, we'll give them one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words worked to quell the chaos, if only slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd began to cluster, the weakest among them, children and elderly, were surrounded by the strongest, who kept their senses sharp and alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, members of Blood Demon rapidly sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than four thousand of them quickly split into two groups, blocking the ends of the canyon to protect the Augustine family in the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First swiftly approached Wesson. "We'll take defense at both ends of the canyon! As for the sides, we won't be able to spread our formations out there. But I doubt we'll face major attacks from that direction. So, I'm leaving the defense of those flanks to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson was filled with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the Blood Demon members, knowing that guarding the vulnerable ends of the canyon, where a mass attack was most likely, was crucial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!" Wesson replied, grateful for their unwavering support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a nod, Wesson called over Class S warriors Greyson, Roy, Bryce, Miranda, and Fiona, along with over two hundred Class AAA fighters, assigning them to cover the left and right defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay alert, everyone! The Eityreia Organization's killers are closing in! They're experts in stealth and assassination..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, before he could finish, a scream erupted nearby as a Class AAA member from the Augustine family had his throat sliced open, blood spraying into the air like a crimson fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Eityreia Organization assassin flickered in and out of sight, striking with lethal precision before vanishing into the darkness. The members surrounding him barely had time to react, let alone mount a defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's face turned ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could utter another word, a chilling scream erupted from another direction. A Class S assassin from the Eityreia Organization had struck again, swiftly dispatching another Class AAA warrior from the Augustine family before disappearing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Wesson cursed, his expression darkening further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Class S killers from the Eityreia Organization were terrifying. Despite the large crowd gathered, they moved with an eerie calmness, slipping silently into their midst to unleash brutal attacks, only to vanish again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The futility of the situation weighed heavily on Wesson's shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The darkness and the dense foliage were a playground for the assassins. They thrived in these conditions, popping up like ghosts on either side, avoiding confrontation with the Blood Demon members, who were clearly a force to be reckoned with. They focused their efforts on the vulnerable Augustine family warriors, emerging from the shadows to strike with deadly efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At every turn, the Augustine family warriors fell victim to the relentless onslaught, their anguished cries echoing through the canyon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, dozens of Eityreia Organization Class S assassins had made their move, leaving a trail of death in their wake as countless Augustine family elites succumbed to their lethal strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it all! Unleash your Realms!" Wesson shouted, urgency lacing his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's eyes blazed with fury and desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of the warriors complied, their Realms flaring to life. But as soon as they did, a blinding white light erupted from the distance, shattering their defenses like glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The League of Divine Descent is here, too!"</span></p></div>
