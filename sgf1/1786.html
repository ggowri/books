        <h1>Chapter 1785 The Thunderstorm Drake Clan's Top Talent</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose was seething with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the undisputed top talent of the Thunderstorm Drake Clan and a mid-stage Deity King, his name was well-known throughout Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the Paramount Supreme Clan had once tried to recruit him, only to be turned down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was proud, believing that among his peers in Celestara, only a handful could hope to defeat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Ambrose felt utterly disrespected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings had the audacity to send just two women to face his entire team?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a blatant dismissal of his strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a fierce glare, Ambrose declared, "Stay back! I can handle these two myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gripping his Supreme Malevolence Sword&mdash;a reward from the Paramount Supreme Clan&mdash;he strode toward Zoe and Hannah with purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Initially, Ambrose didn't want to use the sword; he didn't want anyone to think he relied on a weapon to win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, all he wanted was to crush Hannah and Zoe as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll take you both down in an instant!" Ambrose sneered, his eyes cold and filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe exchanged a look with Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hannah, he thinks he can take us both on by himself?" she said with a chuckle, clearly unfazed by Ambrose's threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah responded, "Let me handle this. You stay out of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe nodded, stepping back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose's lips twitched in irritation as he felt the sting of humiliation wash over him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah retorted, "You'll find out soon enough! If all eight of you came at me, maybe you'd stand a chance. But alone? I can take you down myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose roared with laughter, "Ha! You think you're a threat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mystic Feather Clan's Hannah? I've never even heard your name before! The Mystic Feather Clan is nowhere near the Thunderstorm Drake Clan's level. I'm Ambrose, the pride of my clan, a mid-stage Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think you can take me on alone? Even your clan's top talent wouldn't dare face me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stood tall, brimming with arrogance, convinced of his superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah remained unfazed, her voice steady. "Oh really? Let's see what you're made of! Show me just how powerful this mid-stage Deity King of yours truly is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose wasted no time and charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As you wish! Let's do this! Prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his Supreme Malevolence Sword gripped tightly, he swung it at Hannah from a distance. A brilliant flash of lightning coursed down the blade, and in an instant, a deadly wave of lightning energy surged toward her at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One strike to bring you down!" Ambrose sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the foremost talent of the Thunderstorm Drake Clan, Ambrose knew his Thunder Power far surpassed that of Orson's. With the support of the Supreme Malevolence Sword, he was supremely confident that nobody below the mid-stage Deity King realm could withstand his strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At best, Hannah, being only an early-stage Deity King, had no chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying lightning strike shot toward Hannah, illuminating her striking features, yet she displayed nothing but fierce determination, showing no sign of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next moment, Hannah made her move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A dense black mist enveloped her body, and a heartbeat later, the lightning energy crashed into the fog with a series of small explosions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mist writhed violently under the assault, threatening to implode at any moment, but remarkably, it held firm until the energy dissipated. Not a single scratch marred Hannah's form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose's jaw dropped in disbelief. "How is this even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah chuckled, her confidence unwavering, "There's nothing impossible here. You, a Thunderstorm Drake Clan prodigy, aren't nearly as formidable as you think! Your lightning power pales in comparison to Vivienne's! I may not be able to stop her attacks, but yours? Too easy to handle! If you've got more tricks up your sleeve, you best show them now, or you'll be out of luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose's face darkened at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're asking for it! I was just testing the waters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, let me show you what I can really do! Thunderstorm of a Thousand Strikes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose was furious; he couldn't accept being outmatched by someone of a lower rank like Hannah. With wild determination, he swung his Supreme Malevolence Sword multiple times, unleashing a barrage of lightning strikes that rained down like a catastrophic storm upon the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the arena felt like it was being swallowed by a tempest as the waves of lightning engulfed everything in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah appeared minuscule amidst the storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, she remained calm, her composure a stark contrast to the chaos around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I told you, your Thunder Power can't hold a candle to Vivienne's! Sure, you're a mid-stage Deity King like her, but you're not even fit to carry her shoes! Time to break through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Hannah unleashed her own counterattack.</span></p></div>
