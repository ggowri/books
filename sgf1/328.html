        <h1>Chapter 328 A Group of Animals</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately took out a pair of glasses from the Dimensional Space and put them on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, his mastery of spatial power had become increasingly advanced. </span><span>When </span><span>opening Dimensional Space, he could do so with great stealth and discretion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Ryan and the other two were right next to him, they did not notice anything unusual about Osborne. They just thought that he was taking out the glasses </span><span>from his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the three individuals who were unfamiliar with spatial power, they simply perceived the subtle spatial fluctuations as energy emanating from Osborne's body, without giving it much thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put on his glasses, and the perspective of a combat drone suddenly appeared above the lenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the combat drone was hovering over an isolated island. The four fleeing pirate leaders drove the pirate ship into a safe harbor and quickly rushed into the jungle of the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the combat drone had thermal sensors</span><span>, so Osborne</span><span> could see four red dots moving through the jungle and quickly heading towards the east of the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, the four red dots disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned for a moment, and then he realized that the four people must have entered an underground cave, and the thermal sensing camera could not capture their movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect them to be hidden underground."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, feeling a little embarrassed. Since the pirates hid in an underground cave, Osborne had no way of figuring out their numbers or strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they rashly entered the cave, they would be in trouble if there was an expert hiding inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne was with Ryan, Nathan and Yulissa. If they were blocked in the cave by a large number of enemies, it would be very difficult for them to escape unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It seems that we can only go closer and take a look.</span><span> </span><span>I hope their underground cave is not too deep, not beyond the range of my X-ray vision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne continued to use the strong wind to sweep the three people and headed towards the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes later, the four people arrived above the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced around the island and found many pirates' small boats under the cover of trees, but no one was there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it all underground? That's fine, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the Satan's Eye and looked towards the place where the pirates disappeared. Soon, Osborne discovered a concealed entrance, leading into a cave that wound its way deeper into the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his x-ray vision, everything was extremely clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were three pirates guarding near the cave entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye went 16 feet deeper; the cave began to head parallel to the west.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His level five Satan's Eye had a very strong X-ray vision, so he could even see blood diamonds buried more than dozens of feet under rocks and soil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 16-foot-deep cave naturally could not block his X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne discovered that at the end of the cave, there was a huge space, like a war shelter, with an area of more than ten thousand square feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that space, he found that there were only more than 20 pirates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in another corner, Osborne found more people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people seemed to be all women, slender and thin, and were tied up with iron chains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Women? Bound women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a bad</span><span> gut</span><span> feeling. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regular pirates were only after money. Even if they seized a ship, they would only ask for a ransom and generally would not kill people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if they went too far, the escort fleets of the major powers would </span><span>come after them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But not all pirates were like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of pirates in front of them, carrying rocket launchers and about to attack the Augustine family's ship from a few miles away, were obviously not regular pirates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those women tied with chains were most likely abducted by them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for what the pirates would do with the abducted women, Osborne didn't need to think twice to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could only be for the pirates' amusement and to satisfy their desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he saw that the four pirate leaders who had escaped, after communicating with their men, all walked towards the women in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They roughly pushed the women to the ground, then pounced on them and started to vent their anger violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those women were struggling, but they were ruthlessly beaten by them. In the end, they could only endure the pirates' physical abuse and let their tears stream down their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Damn it</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing such a scene, Osborne instantly showed cold murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had known</span><span> it</span><span>, I </span><span>would </span><span>have killed them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists tightly, filled with immense anger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These pirates deserved to die. Not only did they attack the Augustine family's ship without any regard for the safety of the passengers, but they also abducted hundreds of innocent women, imprisoning them underground and subjecting them to physical abuse and humiliation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a bunch of beasts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He emanated a chilling aura, causing Yulissa and the other two feel the shift in atmosphere. In that moment, Osborne seemed to transform into a terrifying beast, with an intent to devour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Osborne, what's wrong with you?" Yulissa </span><span>asked </span><span>in a trembling voice. She didn't understand why he suddenly became so </span><span>scary</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan and Nathan didn't even dare to breathe at this time, looking at him in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip and forced himself to suppress his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not explain but just stirred up a strong wind and brought the three people to the</span><span> the cave entrance</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "You stay here and guard the entrance of the cave! Don't let anyone escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying that, he didn't give the three people a chance to ask questions and rushed into the cave quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the three pirates guarding the cave entrance had their heads blown up by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not slow down and rushed into the depths of the cave.</span></p></div>
