        <h1>Chapter 2497 Phantomagic Realm-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I can obtain Dragon Elixir and use it to enter the Enlightenment State, can I elevate all these elemental essences to the Sacredness Level? </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if low-grade or mid-grade Dragon Elixir d</span><span>id</span><span>n't work, top-grade Dragon Elixir or even Ultimate Dragon Elixir should be able to do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">However, saving my parents is more important than the Dragon Elixir. After I rescue my parents, if there's still time, I'll go to the Phantomagic Realm to see if I can get some Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne made up his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Azael said to Agatha, "Agnes, the Dragon Elixir from the Phantomagic Realm is a treasure. Moreover, not many people know about the Phantomagic Realm, and even fewer know it will appear near Stellar Region M72 Inferno Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're lucky to have run into me. If it were someone else, they wouldn't tell you this. After all, the more people who know about the Phantomagic Realm, the more will come to compete with us for the Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You, like me, are a primary Sacredness Level warrior, fully capable of killing Heavenly Demons on the outskirts of the Phantomagic Realm. However, it is still somewhat dangerous. How about we team up, look out for each other, and split the rewards equally?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael patted his chest and continued, "In the Galactic Stellar Region, I may not be the supreme prodigy, but my strength is definitely not weak. Among those at the same cultivation level, few can defeat me. Even if surrounded by a large group of Heavenly Demons, I can surely protect you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha said calmly, "Forget about teaming up. We haven't decided to go to the Phantomagic Realm."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Agatha looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Azael, thank you for telling us about the Phantomagic Realm. But just like Agnes said, we might not go to the Phantomagic Realm. We came to Stellar Region M72 for other matters, not for the Phantomagic Realm."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael looked a bit disappointed. "Alright. If you decide to go to the Phantomagic Realm, make sure to team up with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he glanced at Agatha again. Clearly, he was very interested in Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha felt a bit helpless and could only move behind Osborne, using him to block Azael's fiery gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael didn&rsquo;t mind and simply thought Agatha was shy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly said in a low voice, "Since you don&rsquo;t want to go to the Phantomagic Realm, then leave here quickly and don&rsquo;t get tricked by those Cobalt Island people."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Cosmic Translocator here was definitely sabotaged by those bastards from Cobalt Island. They know we&rsquo;re in a hurry to get to the Phantomagic Realm and can&rsquo;t take a detour, so they deliberately damaged the translocator here to force us to hand over a lot of resources and wealth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We have no choice because the Phantomagic Realm will appear in half a month, so we can only give them the resources and wealth. But it&rsquo;s different for you; since your goal isn&rsquo;t the Phantomagic Realm, there&rsquo;s no need to rush."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if you take a detour, it&rsquo;s just an extra month or two. If you can save so many resources and wealth, a one- or two-month detour is nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately raised an eyebrow and said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he wasn&rsquo;t here for the Phantomagic Realm, he was also in a hurry and couldn&rsquo;t possibly take a detour for one or two months.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, taking a detour might bring them danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they encounter powerful Space Pirates, their losses would be even greater. Now, Osborne plans to decide after Angela determines whether the Cosmic Translocator can be repaired.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela walked around the Cosmic Translocator and was quickly walking back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately exchanged a glance with Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela, with a calm and confident smile, nodded at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Angela can repair the Cosmic Translocator here, things will be much easier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Dexter walked over and said, "Since you've checked the Cosmic Translocator, bring out all the resources we need. If we can repair the Cosmic Translocator sooner, you can use it earlier and get to Inferno Planet faster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you miss the Phantomagic Realm, don't blame us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Dexter crossed his arms with an arrogant expression.</span></p></div>
