        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prince Chuck, the Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging is incredibly valuable!" Osborne exclaimed, his eyes wide with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck merely smiled, a hint of amusement in his expression. "Valuable? Perhaps. But when you weigh it against our lives, the Grimoire pales in comparison.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Besides, our Elf Race isn't exactly known for its prowess in forging Sacred Artifacts. Even with the Grimoire in hand for tens of thousands of years, no one has managed to fully grasp its secrets to actually create a Sacred Artifact.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, there's a good chance the Grimoire might not even be genuine; it could be incapable of producing a real Sacred Artifact! However, the section on integrating Azure Ore into divine artifacts to enhance their power is definitely legitimate&mdash;it's been tested and proven.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But whether you can use Azure Ore to transform a divine artifact into a Sacred Artifact remains uncertain. Even if it's possible, you would need a staggering amount of Azure Ore. In the past, we simply didn't have enough to experiment with...</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regardless, I truly hope the Grimoire proves useful to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded appreciatively. "Thank you! If one day I manage to forge a Sacred Artifact thanks to the Grimoire, I won't forget your generosity, Prince Chuck. I'll make sure to craft a Sacred Artifact to express my gratitude to you and the Sylvan Elf Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck's smile widened. "If that day ever comes, we'll consider it a win for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chuckle, Osborne stored away the Azure Ore and his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Grimoire contained methods for integrating Azure Ore into divine artifacts, but he needed a quiet and undisturbed environment to focus, which clearly wasn't the case right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then pulled out a faintly golden crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This crystal was actually the eye of a Mud Golem, its energy faint and unimpressive compared to Azure Ore, making it seem rather insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for his Satan's Eye showing a peculiar interest in it, Osborne might have tossed it aside long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this?" he asked Chuck, curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elf City had existed in deep space for over a hundred thousand years, and its Royal Families held a wealth of knowledge that Osborne was eager to tap into. He hoped Chuck could shed some light on the golden crystal's true nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck furrowed his brow, deep in thought, as if searching through his memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he shook his head. "I've scoured the memory database for every type of treasure, but I can't find anything that matches this exactly!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are some similar items, but they all have slight differences. I can't say for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, but I really don't know what it is," Chuck admitted, a look of regret on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a twinge of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna chimed in, her voice reassuring, "Osborne, Chuck knows a great deal about rare materials, potions, treasures, and even various creatures! I've practically worn out the library in Elf City! If Chuck doesn't know, then it's likely that no one else in Elf City does either.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There aren't many folks in the entire universe who know more about these things than my brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck looked sheepish. "I do have some expertise in this area. I even compiled a book called the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings, but this world is vast and complex, filled with many wonders from the Umbra World, so it's not surprising that there are still things I can't identify.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you need it, I can make a copy of the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. "The Heavenly Compendium of All Beings? That would be fantastic! Thank you so much!"</span></p></div>
