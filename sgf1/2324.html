        <h1>Chapter 2270 Championship Fight-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the referee announced the impending showdown between Osborne and Leroy, the crowd erupted into a frenzy of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew this match was the championship battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne emerged victorious, he would claim the title.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Leroy won, she was likely to take the championship as well, despite having to face Clara afterward&mdash;yet no one believed Clara stood a chance against Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was it&mdash;the battle for the crown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The supporters from Azure Haven Academy chanted Leroy's name, their faces alight with fervent admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, fans from Mystic Sirius Sect were equally passionate, shouting Osborne's name in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's face darkened as she shot a disdainful glare at the higher-ups of Azure Haven Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How despicable!" she hissed through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had just wrapped up a grueling battle with Marreese, unleashing a whopping thirteen Sacred Power arrows in rapid succession. It was obvious that his Sacred Power reserves were running on empty. Yet, just a few minutes later, Azure Haven Academy had thrown him back into the arena to face Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply outrageous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Angela felt helpless. Azure Haven Academy was the defending champion of the last city duel, which was why this year's event was being held on their turf. They had full control over the match pairings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the privilege of hosting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela fumed silently.</span><br><span>"</span><span>Hmph! If Osborne wins, the next city duel will be held at the Mystic Sirius Sect! Just </span><span>you wait&mdash;then I'll show you what a real home-field advantage means and what it's like to face a worthy opponent!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched Osborne step onto the stage, a pang of worry shot through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Has his Sacred Power recovered? Not a </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Chance</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's only an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King. Even if he managed to get his hands on Sacred Power early on, there's no way his reserves are all that deep. When he let loose a barrage of thirteen Sacred Power arrows before, it must've drained him big time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Even I wouldn't be able to bounce back much in such a short span.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Osborne's </span><span>gotta</span><span> be running on fumes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this state, how's he </span><span>gonna</span><span> go toe-to-toe with Leroy? She's got Sacred Power too and is at a higher cultivation level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Angela's view, Osborne's odds of winning this match were next to nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What a pity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But he's done an amazing job! Even if he loses, he's shown his mettle! Maybe I should get in touch with Ms. Alba?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the arena, Osborne and Leroy stood facing each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy had a frosty look on her face, as if the world had wronged her. "You're quite something! The moment I laid eyes on you, I knew you were no ordinary person. You'll be a worthy adversary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And it turns out I was right! Here we are, you and me, battling for the championship. It's a pity, though, that your cultivation level is just too low&mdash;Ascension Eight? You can't possibly compete with me! The title will still belong to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe in ten years, when you've broken through to Ascension Ten, you'll be able to challenge me properly. But for now... you're just not there yet! Save yourself the embarrassment and concede. I don't want to crush your confidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words ignited excitement among the audience below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! Leroy is really something else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's an obvious disparity among the dark-horse contestants! I'll give Osborne credit, he's quite remarkable. But when stacked up against Leroy, he's still a greenhorn! Leroy is the top dog here. If Osborne doesn't throw in the towel, he's </span><span>gonna</span><span> get crushed and end up completely deflated!"</span></p></div>
