        <h1>Chapter 1640 Rapid Advancement</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the Dimensional Bag, there were two thousand Essence Crystals waiting to be absorbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After her breakthrough into the Deity Overlord realm, Diana found that her ability to absorb Essence Crystals had significantly increased. With the favorable environment around them, she could now absorb over a hundred Ultimate Essence Crystals each day to elevate her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing they would be in seclusion for the next fifteen days, Osborne decided to load the Dimensional Bag with all two thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you should start your training now. My clone will wake you up every hour," he instructed, his voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded eagerly. "Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without wasting a moment, she settled down, fully aware of the dangers that lurked in Divine Peak Nine. Every second counted, and she was determined to maximize her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cross-legged, she entered a deep meditative state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne created a Spatial Clone tasked with protecting both Diana and himself. The clone would also ensure they didn't get lost in illusions, which could lead to mental strain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne then began his own training not far away, planning out his goals for the next fifteen days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't need to worry about my realm advancement. With the Infinite Devouring Eyes, I'll break through faster than Diana! In fifteen days, I should reach the mid-stage of Celestial Deity, maybe even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for higher realms, that's unlikely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>My focus should be on strengthening my Divine Body and enhancing my elemental essence. Whether my Divine Body becomes stronger or my elemental essences have a breakthrough, my power will increase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While my Divine Body is already at Level Nine, breaking through to the next level is nearly impossible unless I become a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just because I can't level up doesn't mean I can't make my Divine Body stronger. I can find other ways to enhance its power, like completing the sixth fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for my elemental essences, my space elemental essence is already at Level Seven, and there's no way I can improve that in just fifteen days. So, I'll concentrate on leveling up my lightning and dark elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I can max them out at Level Six, my overall strength will see a significant boost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Level Seven for those is a stretch, so I'll leave that for later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, I also need to upgrade my Spatial Clone. The higher its level, the more clones I can create and the stronger they become..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly organized his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Overall, he had a lot to accomplish in the coming days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>First, completing the sixth fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Second, getting both dark and lightning elemental essences to the peak of Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Third, upgrading the level of his Spatial Clone as much as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's get started! I can't wait to see how strong I'll be in fifteen days!" Osborne murmured, diving into his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time flew by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three days had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, as they trained, neither encountered any dangers. It seemed that this area directly beneath Divine Peak Nine was free from Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's clone, using Satan's Eye, had yet to spot any Deathborn nearby, which eased his worries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, Osborne's Spatial Clone reached Level Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly created another clone, instructing it to search the area for Ultimate Essence Crystals and collect them in the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number of Ultimate Essence Crystals in the Dimensional Space began to rise rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As time continued to pass, Osborne's training goals were steadily met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the end of the fifteen days, he had advanced to the mid-stage of Celestial Deity, with both his dark and lightning elemental essences reaching the pinnacle of Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he had anticipated, breaking through to Level Seven from the pinnacle of Level Six proved to be incredibly challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne decided to abandon that goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, he focused on enhancing his Spatial Clone. With nearly a hundredfold increase in comprehension, he successfully advanced his Spatial Clone to Level Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the final day of his training, only one goal remained&mdash;completing the sixth fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he soon encountered a challenge. Whether it was due to the Lotus not being fully restored or some other reason, Osborne felt that this fusion was far more difficult and slow than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn't rush. Instead, Osborne patiently waited for the right moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, just as the fifteen days were drawing to a close, he initiated the sixth fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity once again. A wave of intense pain washed over him, engulfing his entire being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The roots of the Lotus surged wildly within him, burrowing deeper into his cells, intertwining with his divine power essence and even his soul power essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt an overwhelming sense of unity with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity; it was as if they had become one, indistinguishable from each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This profound connection made his Divine Body even more formidable than before.</span></p></div>
