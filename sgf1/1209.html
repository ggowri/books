        <h1>Chapter 1208 Strange Stone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had spent the last two days in this place, fully absorbed in merging with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. After taking down Cain, his thoughts turned to Anastasia and Zoe, prompting him to leave in a hurry without lingering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even then, he couldn't shake the question. What made this place teem with such dense cosmic energy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne finally had the time to investigate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The passageways, damaged and collapsed from his brief battle with Cain, posed no challenge for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Activating Satan's Eye, he tapped into its powerful X-ray vision to scan the area for anything unusual that could explain the extraordinary concentration of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "After all, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is a Cosmic Treasure. It's been here for millions of years without moving, so there's got to be something peculiar about this place. If I can pinpoint that anomaly, maybe I'll uncover why this location gathers such rich cosmic energy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's Satan's Eye swept the surroundings, he initially thought the search would be tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to his surprise, it didn't take long for him to spot something odd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There it was&mdash;a massive rock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stone was positioned directly beneath where the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had once taken root, buried several hundred yards deep. At first glance, it seemed ordinary&mdash;just a large, rough, circular boulder with a diameter of over a hundred yards. Made of granite, It weighed in at about 245 pounds per cubic foot, so a quick calculation revealed that this rock weighed at least two billion pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't the main point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peering closer through his Satan's Eye, Osborne noticed strange markings etched into the surface of the stone. They didn't appear to be natural; instead, they looked like they had been carved by someone, all crooked and indecipherable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he could see energy swirling around these markings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, an invisible force tugged at the energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get it! This is why there's such a rich concentration of cosmic energy here! The markings on this stone create a mysterious pull, drawing in the surrounding energy and locking it in place. That's why the energy density is so much greater than in the outside world&mdash;up to a hundred times more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this discovery, Osborne felt a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dense cosmic energy was the result of this massive rock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could just take it with him, he could create a new training ground anywhere he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, if he transported this stone to Newport City and buried it deep beneath the Augustine Estate, it wouldn't be long before the energy concentration there skyrocketed to a hundred times that of the outside world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire Augustine Estate would benefit from this newfound training haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to get this rock back! It's too far from the Augustine Estate, and being 12 miles underground makes it a hassle to come here for training. If I bring it back, everyone in the Augustine family can tap into this incredible cosmic energy! Their strength will skyrocket in no time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne made up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were it anyone else attempting to transport this colossal stone, measuring over a hundred yards in diameter and weighing in excess of two billion pounds, to the Augustine Estate in Newport City, hundreds of miles away, such an endeavor would be nothing short of preposterous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even deities, whether Intermediate or Superior, would find it challenging to transport such a colossal stone without causing damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, it was a breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His spatial power and vast Dimensional Space were so expansive that even a stone ten times larger posed no problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get to it!" Osborne said, his hand slicing through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a dimensional rift appeared near the enormous rock. This rift, immense as a giant predator's maw, swiftly engulfed the boulder whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strange stone vanished, absorbed into Osborne's Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the boulder disappeared, Osborne could sense the dense ambient energy around him gradually dissipating. It thinned out until normal levels were restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?" Sebastian and Bryce, along with a few others, were left stunned, their brows furrowed with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we losing this training site?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "No need to worry. The training site isn't disappearing&mdash;I'm just giving it a new address. We're moving it to Newport City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly elaborated on his discovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their jaws dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there anything in this world that's not magical? This is fantastic! The Augustine Estate in Newport City will soon be an unparalleled training paradise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why wait? Let's head back right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were itching to return and transform the Augustine Estate into a true haven of training, now that the local energy had normalized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p></div>
