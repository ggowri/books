        <h1>Chapter 2554 Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, seven days passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only three days remained until the official start of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. At this moment, Osborne could clearly feel that the entire Nebula City had changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More and more people wearing standard Sacred Artifact armor were patrolling the streets. Whenever they encountered someone suspicious, they would immediately step forward to question and confirm their identity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, more and more powerful individuals appeared in Nebula City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the streets, it was even common to see members of the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These days, whenever Osborne had free time, he would observe the Empire Hotel nearby and noticed that almost all participants of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel had already arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Glorious Divine Kingdom has a total of ten regions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Out of the hundred participants in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, apart from Osborne, Clara, and Leroy, almost everyone else had gathered at the Empire Hotel by now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From time to time, princes and princesses would visit and extend invitations to them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne even saw Brent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brent is younger than Osborne from the previous life, and after more than a thousand years, he has also reached the Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also came to Empire Hotel for recruitment, but unfortunately gained nothing. In the Glorious Divine Kingdom, there are over a hundred princes, and Brent is not the strongest, ranking only in the middle to lower tier. Recruiting these prodigies to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel is no easy task.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To anyone, Brent has no chance of becoming the next Glorious Divine Emperor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. Whether in strength, influence, or strategy, he is far inferior to Weston and others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their strength is worlds apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brent was the one who tormented and humiliated Osborne the most back then, so naturally, Osborne wouldn't let him go. However, Osborne remained calm and didn't rush to take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything must wait until the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel is over!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would wait until he had honored his mother, visited Necropolis City, and achieved the breakthrough to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And that day, Osborne noticed a giant boulder outside the Empire Hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the boulder, some golden words were shimmering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These words were condensed from Sacred Power. Osborne took one look and became curious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rankings of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured and couldn't help but leave the hotel, walking to the boulder to take a closer look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, countless people were drawn over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the participants of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel in the Empire Hotel couldn't help but step out, all looking at the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings First Place&mdash;Princess Seraphina!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings Second Place&mdash;Prince Emiliano!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings Third Place&mdash;Prince Matthew!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings Tenth Place&mdash;East Zone 1, Mason Richardson!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings Eleventh Place&mdash;North Zone 1, Casey Miller!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings Twenty-Fifth Place, Eastern Zone 3, Brenda Ramos!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings Twenty-Eighth Place, Eastern Zone 3, Osborne Augustine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings 108th Place, Eastern Zone 3, Leroy Holiday, Clara Rondo!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly scanned the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings and couldn't help but raise an eyebrow in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Glorious Divine Kingdom actually sent nine princes and princesses to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, and the nine princes and princesses dominated the top nine spots of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, the people around surprisingly felt it was no big deal.</span></p></div>
