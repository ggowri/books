        <h1>Chapter 2676 Convergence-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!" Frederick was furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The translocator had already collapsed, and he could no longer pursue Adriana. By the time he set up another translocator, Adriana was long gone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick roared, "Ms. Alba, you can't escape. When I return to Racial Convergence Planet, I will lead an army to destroy the Fairy Moon Sect. Submission to me is your only option. Just you wait!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were filled with murderous intent. "Set up the translocator!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, through the Level Three Cosmic Translocator left by Osborne, Adriana returned to Racial Convergence Planet. She immediately let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana thought, "Luckily, there was a Cosmic Translocator. Otherwise, it would have been hard to shake off Emperor Frederick's pursuit. Even if I managed to escape him, it would take me a long time to return to Racial Convergence Planet and the Fairy Moon Sect."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, the Fairy Moon Sect would likely have already been destroyed by Emperor Frederick and his forces. Although he hasn't reached Imperial Empyrean Sacredness yet, he's very close to it. In fact, he could achieve Imperial Empyrean Sacredness at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he didn't have the Imperial Artifact Armor and the Imperial Artifact Sword, I might be able to fight him. But now..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Adriana's face turned extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she disrupted Frederick's plans in the Skyfall Casket, preventing him from smoothly reaching Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, she hadn't completely stopped him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Frederick's power had become even more terrifying than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "He succeeded in the end!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana felt a surge of pressure. She knew very well how much Frederick hated her. Once he returned to the Glorious Divine Kingdom, Frederick would definitely lead an attack to destroy the Fairy Moon Sect immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "I must return to the Fairy Moon Sect immediately and prepare in advance. At the very least, I need to relocate all the core disciples, like Isa and Clarissa. As long as they survive, even if the Fairy Moon Sect is destroyed by Emperor Frederick, they will surely create glory once again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of Isa and Clarissa, Adriana then thought of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't help but sigh, as she hadn't seen Osborne come out of the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana thought, "Osborne must have already died in the Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, for some reason, Adriana felt very uncomfortable. She took out the terminal and tentatively dialed Osborne's terminal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, she was stunned, because the terminal was connected, and Osborne's extremely excited voice came through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Ms. Alba, you're indeed still alive. Have you also returned to the Racial Convergence Planet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Adriana was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Osborne reunited with Adriana. However, when Osborne saw May beside Adriana, he was startled, his face filled with shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "May is still alive? How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was utterly shocked. He had personally seen May enter that eerie forest, witnessed her trapped inside, and then pierced through a vital spot by tree branches.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, May actually appeared!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne was extremely shocked, he didn&rsquo;t show it. He quickly used Telepathy to communicate with Clara and the other two, instructing them not to act unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that May seemed off and thought, "How can someone who died appear again? What exactly did May go through in that forest?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you're all alive! That's great!" Adriana was delighted. "What exactly happened? Why didn&rsquo;t we see you when we came out? I thought you had died in the Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was speechless; he had also thought Adriana had died in there, but it turned out they just weren&rsquo;t teleported out at the same time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn&rsquo;t help but ask, "Ms. Alba, did you come out of the Skyfall Casket with others? Besides May, who else came out with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very curious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana didn&rsquo;t think much and replied, "There were many people, including Emperor Frederick, Queen Callista, Prince Weston, and Prince Quinn. They all came out with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne was shocked again, thinking, "They&rsquo;re all alive! What on earth is going on?"</span></p></div>
