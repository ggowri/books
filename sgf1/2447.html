        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, it's just a low-grade Sacred Artifact for now. The Warfare Mist it releases won't be particularly strong." Thinking this, Osborne began to take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Holding the Bloodwrought Bow, Osborne didn't hesitate. He unleashed his full Sacred Power, forming a brilliant Sacred Power Arrow that shot out at incredible speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of the Sacred Power Arrow was terrifying. Although this arrow didn't incorporate the Divine Ascendance Technique, among those participating in the state duel, fewer than twenty could withstand it, while the rest would be instantly defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne was very confident in this arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Power Arrow instantly appeared in front of the Warfare Shield, then blasted into the Warfare Mist, producing an incredibly terrifying explosion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Power Arrow shattered instantly, while the Warfare Mist kept surging but remained stable, unbroken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly surprised, thinking, "Does it really have such strong defense? My arrow just now didn't completely break the Warfare Mist, only slightly shook it, without causing even a single gap."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression grew serious. He thought, "Then I'll try firing ten arrows at once."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow once again. He still didn't integrate the Divine Ascendance Technique into the Sacred Power Arrow, merely unleashed Sacred Power wildly, forming ten Sacred Power Arrows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten Sacred Power Arrows shot out simultaneously, striking the same spot on the Warfare Mist one after another. It triggered an incredibly terrifying energy surge, causing the Warfare Mist to shake violently, as if it could break at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the stability of the Warfare Mist exceeded Osborne's expectations. Even under such circumstances, the Warfare Mist remained unbroken, not even showing a single gap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Osborne was truly shocked, thinking, "I can't believe I couldn't break it even with ten arrows at once?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were in a state duel, Osborne confidently believed that aside from a few like Agatha and Horace, no one else could withstand this move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it couldn't break through the Warfare Mist released by the Warfare Shield at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, the Warfare Shield had already been restricted to a low-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once again!" Osborne was a bit excited at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The stronger the Warfare Shield, the happier he was, because he had already regarded this Warfare Shield as his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Warfare Shield was definitely stronger than Agatha's Phoenix Skeletal Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, when facing the Phoenix Skeletal Shield, Osborne didn&rsquo;t feel it was this tricky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Osborne fused the Divine Ascendance Technique into the Sacred Power Arrow and directly shot ten arrows at once.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from Dimensional Maw, Osborne infused all the Divine Ascendance Techniques he mastered, including Spatial Oblivion Slash, Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes, Multi-thunder Chainstorm, Tempestuous Celestial Bolt Descent, into the Sacred Power Arrow. At this moment, the ten Sacred Power Arrows emitted incredibly terrifying energy waves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Even if Agatha uses the Phoenix Skeletal Shield, these ten arrows might not be stopped. Let me see how strong your defense really is."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the ten terrifying arrows shot out, striking the Warfare Mist once again. But something that shocked Osborne happened. Amid the intense vibrations, the Warfare Mist completely absorbed and withstood the power of the ten arrows, without even a single breach.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, feeling both happy and sad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was happy because the strength of the Warfare Shield exceeded his expectations. If he could pass the test of the Warfare Ancient Tree, he would obtain the Warfare Shield, compensating for his ordinary defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was sad because he had given it his all, yet still couldn't break through the defense of the Warfare Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked very serious, thinking, "Is my attack power really this weak?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like I can only use my ultimate move. If you can still withstand this, then I really have no other way." After saying this, Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Sacred Power Arrow quickly formed on the Bloodwrought Bow. Its shape was strange, not an arrow, but a black sphere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne infused Dimensional Maw, one of the Divine Ascendance Techniques he mastered, into the Sacred Power Arrow, creating the Maw Arrow!</span></p></div>
