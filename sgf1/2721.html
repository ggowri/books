        <h1>Chapter 2592 Her Opportunity Has Come</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle between Clara and Emiliano went pretty much as Osborne had expected. From the very beginning, Clara was at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family members had lost far too many times, so even the arrogant Emiliano didn&rsquo;t waste any words and directly started the battle. Like Matthew, he also brought out his Supreme Sacred Artifact right from the start.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he could barely wield the Supreme Sacred Artifact, its power still far surpassed Clara's Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, even without considering the difference in Sacred Artifacts, Emiliano's strength was still slightly superior to Clara's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Clara being at a disadvantage was inevitable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only consolation was that Clara's defense was much stronger than others. Under her control, her Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain was incredibly agile, capable of blocking many attacks for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of this, she didn't lose quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She is looking for an opportunity!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she hadn't asked Osborne whether she could win before stepping into the ring, or if Osborne hadn't given her a definite answer, Clara might have already given up by now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She did feel the gap in strength between them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne said she could win, which gave her immense confidence. She held on, waiting for a chance to use Dominating Coil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was her only way to defeat Emiliano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Still not giving up?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano had completely overpowered Clara. At this point, he finally relaxed, knowing victory was just a matter of time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A confident and arrogant expression returned to his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's not too late to surrender now! Otherwise, you'll regret it! Your strength is indeed impressive, truly worthy of being called a dark horse! In my opinion, even Princess Rosalie, ranked fourth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, might not be your match!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But unfortunately, your opponent is me. You can't beat me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara bit her lip tightly, desperately resisting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she no longer had much strength to fight back. She could only struggle to defend, hoping to hold on longer until Emiliano made a mistake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the spectators could see that Clara was just one step away from defeat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the Royal Family members also breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano did not disappoint them. He displayed immense strength, overpowering Clara. Just a little longer, and Clara would surely give in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, with three Royal Family members in the top five, they could finally save some face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara's situation grew tougher, but she still didn't give up. Like a patient hunting fox, she quietly waited for her chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She lacked strength, but she had plenty of patience!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, the opportunity she had been waiting for finally arrived!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano, though suppressing Clara, could never completely defeat her, which made him both angry and a bit anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He chose to unleash greater power, aiming to completely crush Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he forgot that his compatibility with his Supreme Sacred Artifact was still insufficient. He could barely wield the weapon and couldn't fully control it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, the longer and fiercer the battle dragged on, the more desperately he unleashed his power, the easier it became for him to lose control of the Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It could even cause it to completely lose control!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Emiliano unleashed greater power, he suddenly felt something wrong with the Supreme Sacred Artifact in his hand, as a surge of chaotic energy erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a sign of it losing control!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano's expression changed, but he wasn't too worried. He was absolutely confident he could quell this loss of control and calm the Supreme Sacred Artifact in his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just needed a little time!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was these few seconds that gave Clara the chance for a desperate counterattack!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Clara noticed Emiliano's Supreme Sacred Artifact was about to lose control, she knew her chance had come. Without any hesitation, she unleashed all her power and began her counterattack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dominating Coil!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara unleashed her ancestral special combat skill. The Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain in her hand instantly abandoned defense, switched to attack mode, and coiled toward Emiliano's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under normal circumstances, Emiliano would have absolute confidence to dodge or block Clara's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Emiliano was trying to regain control of his Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, he could only watch as Clara's Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain swiftly burrowed into the Dimensional Space, then reappeared beside him, wrapping around his body circle after circle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I did it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara was overjoyed. She seized the fleeting opportunity and, taking advantage of the time Emiliano needed to control the Supreme Sacred Artifact, successfully executed the Dominating Coil, wrapping Emiliano's body tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And next, it was her time to shine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A peculiar power emanated from the Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain, swiftly suppressing Emiliano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Emiliano had already gained control of the Supreme Sacred Artifact in his hand. When he realized he was bound by the Dominating Coil, he didn't panic but attempted to forcibly break the chain apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His strength and power were greater than Clara's, and he believed he could definitely break free from the restraints!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A struggle began. Emiliano unleashed astonishing power, and Clara fought back with all her might.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Emiliano's expression turned grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He realized he couldn't break free!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Sacred Power was depleting rapidly, yet he couldn't break free. Instead, he was being bound tighter and tighter, to the point where even mobilizing his strength became difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face turned pale, showing a hint of fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, many Royal Family members stood up nervously, clenching their fists to cheer for Emiliano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Break free quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up and break free!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your strength is greater than hers. You can do it! The winner will definitely be you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They haven't personally experienced the power of Clara's Dominating Coil, so they have no idea how difficult it is.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since I mastered the Dominating Coil, only Osborne has broken free from it when our cultivation levels were about the same!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Other than that, no one else has ever escaped!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your strength may be a bit greater than mine, but not by much! Thinking you can break free from my Dominating Coil? You're dreaming!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've already lost!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling Emiliano's weakening struggles and resistance, a smile appeared on her beautiful face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She won!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire fight, she was being suppressed, and many times she was on the verge of losing. She almost gave up, but remembering Osborne's words that she could win, she was filled with confidence. She kept waiting for the right opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, her chance came. She didn't miss it and successfully executed the Dominating Coil, defeating the powerful Emiliano!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She won!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She, along with Osborne and Leroy, successfully advanced to the top five!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, countless spectators in the Glorious Divine Kingdom were cheering for her.</span></p></div>
