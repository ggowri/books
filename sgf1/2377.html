        <h1>Chapter 2298 Changes on the Leaderboard-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had absolutely no clue that because he'd been on the sixth layer for ages and his score hadn't budged in a long time, a whole bunch of people were convinced he was a goner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy, who'd briefly sat at the top of the leaderboard, became the talk of the town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those out there searching for tokens inside the Arctic Maw Chasm were chattering away about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the third layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After scouring the fourth layer for over three hours, Clara finally made up her mind to call it quits. Even though she still had a decent amount of Sacred Power in the tank, she decided to head back to the third layer early for a breather, just to play it safe. Her plan was to make a comeback to the fourth layer once her Sacred Power was fully recharged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile appeared on Clara's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I've really hit the jackpot! I managed to snag a total of twenty-eight tokens! Each token on the fourth layer is worth a cool thousand points, so that's twenty-eight thousand right there!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I wonder how Osborne's holding up.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in her head, Clara pulled out her badge to check the leaderboard. She'd been so wrapped up in the token-hunting frenzy that this was the very first time she'd bothered to peek at the rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The big shot at the top of the leaderboard now was Agatha, sitting pretty with a whopping score of 800 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right behind her in second place was Horace, with 700 thousand points to his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occupying the third and fourth spots were Benson and Broderick, each racking up 400 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon laying eyes on the top four, Clara was left a bit </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>. Sure, she'd had a stroke of luck on the fourth layer, but the tokens she'd found only amounted to less than thirty thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those top four guys? Their scores were a good ten times more than hers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, the rankings did jibe with the strength rankings. The bigwigs at the top of the leaderboard were also the cream of the crop in terms of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Clara caught sight of the fifth-place finisher on the leaderboard, she felt as if she'd been hit by a bolt of lightning. Clara even rubbed her eyes hard, making double-sure she wasn't hallucinating, before a look of sheer shock spread across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fifth place was Osborne, with a staggering 300 thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy smokes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara let out a gasp, and a wave of elation washed over her.</span><br><span>Has Osborne really managed to score 300 thousand points? That was more than ten times what I'd gotten! And he is sitting pretty in fifth place on the leaderboard?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was beyond belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, Clara's face fell, and a worried look took over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was no fool. One glance at Osborne's score and she instantly cottoned on to the only possible way he could've raked in so many points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had ventured into the sixth layer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Clara had never set foot in the sixth layer herself, she'd heard plenty of chatter about it. She knew just how hair-raising it was. Only the top twenty powerhouses in the strength rankings could hang around on the sixth layer for any length of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, they could end up biting the dust in there and never make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara tried to pep herself up, murmuring, "Osborne, what on earth made him head for the sixth layer? But he'll be okay! I mean, how else could he have scored so many points?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a bunch of folks came back to the third layer via the Translocator. It was obvious they were a tight-knit group, and they were yapping away about something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Osborne hasn't increased his score in over three hours since he topped the leaderboard! He must have died on the sixth layer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! What an idiot! He's ranked outside the top one hundred in terms of strength, yet he dared to go to the sixth layer! He was lucky enough to get 300 thousand points in ten minutes, but he paid for it with his life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must be dead! Otherwise, his score wouldn't be stuck. What a pity about those 300 thousand points. If we had them, we could easily get into the top twenty, maybe even the top ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, what a waste! 300 thousand points..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conversation drifted into Clara's ears, and in an instant, her face lost all its color, turning as pale as a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne? Dead on the sixth layer?</span></p></div>
