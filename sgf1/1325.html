        <h1>Chapter 1324 Start With Rosmandi's Augustine Family!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nelson declared, "We're willing to cooperate with you to wipe out all major human factions on the Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, you must honor your promises. Within three months, we need to leave Blue Planet and return to Celestara. There, you must designate an area spanning 30 thousand miles as our exclusive territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In exchange, we'll infiltrate the human resistance forces, providing intelligence and, when necessary, eliminate key figures among the human opposition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Apocalypse Harbinger grinned broadly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent, you've made a wise decision! A 30-thousand-mile exclusive territory is not a problem. On behalf of the illustrious Lord Malevolence, I can guarantee you that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you remain loyal, Lord Malevolence won't skimp on rewarding you. He'll even foster Pantheon League and Eityreia Organization to become the strongest human forces. With his power, nurturing a few Deity King warriors for you is quite feasible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Apocalypse Harbinger finished, both Nelson and Emperor Dare were visibly excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prospect of having a Deity King warrior was tantalizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the Pantheon League and Eityreia Organization, during the Age of Gods, were among the top dominions, merely a step away from becoming Deity King-level powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But breaking through to Deity King had proven immensely difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had dreamed of reaching this echelon for eons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Lord Malevolence dared claim the ability to develop Deity Kings, given that many Deity King warriors had fallen by his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal!" Nelson exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's seal this pact with a handshake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nelson and Emperor Dare shook hands with Apocalypse Harbinger, visibly thrilled by the agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger gave a slight nod and remarked, "Very good! From this moment, the Pantheon League and Eityreia Organization will serve as vassal states of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Upon returning to Celestara, high-ranking members of the Dark Deity Legion will personally confer honors upon you. Now, let's strategize on how to eliminate all human powers on the Blue Planet and take full control of this world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nelson and Emperor Dare nodded in agreement, ready to proceed with their plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nelson quickly began outlining his plan. "Right now, the Blue Planet hosts four major factions besides our own: the Court of the Sun, the Prophet Alliance, the Lord League, and lastly, Rosmandi's Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Among them, the Court of the Sun and the Prophet Alliance are probably the strongest, with the Lord League following behind. Although the Augustine family took down the Deschanel Clan, we're in the dark about how they managed it. We suspect that Rosmandi's Augustine family is the weakest of the four, with the least resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are the only major force that didn't emerge from the remnants of the Age of Gods but built themselves up from scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With our Pantheon League and the Eityreia Organization joining forces with your Dark Deity Legion, we have more than enough strength to crush any one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, if they unite, it could be troublesome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thus, I propose we act swiftly and eliminate two of them first. The Court of the Sun is too elusive, and the Prophet Alliance's ability to foresee the future makes them tricky, as they could predict our moves and counter them effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why I suggest we target the Lord League and Rosmandi's Augustine family first. Striking them quickly and decisively will ensure no force on the Blue Planet can resist us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Nelson finished, Emperor Dare nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I back Mr. Nelson Thornberry's suggestion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger grinned, adding, "A solid plan, but there's one thing you need to know: we can disregard the Court of the Sun for now. My sources confirm they've left the Blue Planet for Celestara and have become a significant human rebel faction there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've been causing some trouble for the Dark Deity Legion, but their days are numbered. We're not so easily trifled with&mdash;the Court of the Sun will soon be no more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, our real focus should be on the Prophet Alliance, the Lord League, and Rosmandi's Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they join forces, they can't stand against us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll take down the weakest&mdash;Rosmandi's Augustine family&mdash;then the Lord League, and finally encircle the Prophet Alliance. Even with foresight, they'll have no escape. Their fate is sealed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a shared understanding, Nelson and Emperor Dare both nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's start with wiping out Rosmandi's Augustine family!"</span></p></div>
