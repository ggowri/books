        <h1>Chapter 609 Godfather Strikes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett slapped Osborne from a distance, and Osborne felt as if the sky had collapsed above him. An invisible force immobilized his body, leaving him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the power of a Class S Supreme Overlord? Just a casual slap is so terrifying that I can't resist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone, regardless of their rank, Class A, Class AA, or Class AAA, was filled with fear, helplessly watching Everett's attack descend toward Osborne, who was on the </span><span>verge of being crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Godfather moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Six-star points flashed in his eyes as a power of mind control surged forward, blocking Everett's strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, you dare to interfere?" Everett fumed. "You're looking for death. Are you not afraid of the League of Divine Descent declaring war on you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather remained calm. "Let them come. My Augustine family will respond if your League of Divine Descent starts a war over this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're courting death. I declare that you will not live much longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett shouted in rage. "It's been a while since we last sparred, hasn't it? Since you won't live much longer, let's fight again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gladly!" Godfather replied coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Battle in the sky!" Everett declared, vanishing instantly. The crowd felt a terrifying force shoot upward, disappearing beyond their perception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather calmly surveyed the area. "Everyone stays here and wait for my return. I'll handle this matter then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he also disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Similarly, a terrifying force rushed into the sky and instantly disappeared into the sky where they could not sense it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in Arena Number One was stunned at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two Class S Supreme Overlords were fighting overhead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just for Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rosenthal family members looked at Osborne with disdain as if he were already dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family members glared at him, seething with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a few from the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> branch bloodline, like Isaac and Nathan, appeared worried but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, ignoring the hostile glares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was frustrated by the League of Divine Descent's arrogance in claiming exclusive rights to the light elemental power, treating anyone who possessed it as a blasphemer against the gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did they truly regard themselves as descendants of the gods or omnipotent gods?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because he had light elemental power, did they want to execute him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was angry but knew he had no other options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The League of Divine Descent was too powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his strength, he felt like a mere insect before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would care about the lives of insects?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only hope this situation wouldn't endanger Isa and pray that Godfather could withstand Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne vowed that if he survived, he would work tirelessly to increase his power, and when he became a Class S Supreme Overlord or stronger, he would make the League of Divine Descent pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to execute me? Just wait!" he silently vowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a sharp voice cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, if you're a man, stand up and take responsibility! You committed a great sin. You shouldn't make us atone for your mistakes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should have left with Everett instead of forcing Godfather to rescue you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your actions will harm everyone in the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to see Owen speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked calmly, "What crime have I committed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shouldn't have used Satan's Eye and consumed the Light elemental essence! Your ignorance has put our entire Augustine family in danger from the League of Divine Descent, risking war and death for us all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, you should take responsibility yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should the whole family suffer for your mistakes? If you die, the entire Augustine family can be saved. Why not just go die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go die quickly and don't come to hurt others!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many in the Augustine family shouted at him, demanding he take the initiative to leave with Everett to spare them from involvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened, but he remained silent, closing his eyes to ignore them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't let the Augustine family bear the burden for him. If Godfather had chosen to hand him over, he wouldn't have involved them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wouldn't willingly walk to his death either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Godfather failed to rescue him, he would fight to escape, no matter how slim his chances were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his eyes closed, he endured the accusations from his family, waiting patiently for the outcome of Godfather and Everett's battle high above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to everyone, a fierce confrontation was unfolding in the sky.</span></p></div>
