        <h1>Chapter 970 Kill Rumen</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A terrifying bolt of Divine Judgment erupted from the Godfather's scepter, flashing toward Rumen with blinding speed. It was so fast that even Rumen, a peak Class S warrior, couldn't dodge it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the crackling lightning enveloped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone watched in horror as Rumen's defenses shattered like glass under the onslaught of lightning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The powerful energy surged through his body, and in a heartbeat, he exploded into a gruesome shower of flesh and blood, disintegrating into nothingness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A heavy silence fell over the battlefield.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everett, who had been locked in combat with Osborne, stared wide-eyed at the spot where Rumen had just stood. Without a second thought, he abandoned the fight with Osborne and turned to flee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen was dead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a single move, Sebastian had obliterated him, leaving no trace behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What kind of power was this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen was one of the vice leaders of the League of Divine Descent, ranked within the top fifty of the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings&mdash;far stronger than Everett. Yet here he was, taken down in an instant by Sebastian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could Everett not be afraid?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he didn't run now, he might end up just like Rumen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, too, was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gaped at Sebastian and the Godfather's scepter, his breath hitching in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew Sebastian's current state; Sebastian was gravely injured and barely at his peak. There was no way he could have matched Rumen in a fair fight, let alone kill him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only explanation was the power of the Godfather's scepter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The surge of energy that had just erupted from the scepter filled Osborne with dread.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because that was divine power!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Sin and Crimson stood off to the side, equally alarmed. They exchanged wary glances, their expressions shifting to one of caution as they began to back away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey! You think you can just waltz in and out like it's nothing? Do you take the Augustine family for a joke?" Sebastian's voice was icy as he raised the Godfather's scepter once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, an overwhelming force surged from Mount Celestial Reach, flooding into the scepter and causing it to radiate a terrifying light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Everett, Sin, and Crimson felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sin and Crimson shouted in unison, "Stop!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sebastian, we've heard the rumors about your Godfather's scepter. It can unleash devastating power within the Augustine family's territory, capable of easily wiping out top Class S warriors. I used to think it was just a myth, but clearly, it's all too real!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you need to back off! You've already killed Rumen, which means you've effectively declared war on the League of Divine Descent. Are you really going to take us out, too, and completely annihilate the Eityreia Organization?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You must understand the consequences of taking on the Eityreia Organization! If you do, every member of the Augustine family will be plunged into fear, hunted down by assassins wherever they go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Sin and Crimson spoke, Sebastian's brow furrowed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sebastian! Let us go! The Augustine family is already on shaky ground, with the Aberrants causing enough trouble. Now you've gone and made an enemy of the League of Divine Descent. You better think long and hard about whether you want to take on the Eityreia Organization, too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The threat in their words was unmistakable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian snorted dismissively. "Get lost! I'll let you live today, but if you dare to step foot in the Augustine Estate again, I swear I'll hunt you down!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sin and Crimson breathed a sigh of relief and hurriedly made their escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everett, on the other hand, was long gone, having vanished without a trace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, the Augustine Estate fell silent once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rushed to Sebastian's side, furrowing his brow in concern. "Grandpa, why did you let them go? Even if you spare them, the Eityreia Organization won't back off. We should've taken them out, and then..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before he could finish, Sebastian suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood, his body swaying as if he might collapse any second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes widened in alarm as he quickly moved to support Sebastian. "Grandpa!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a wry smile etched on his face, Sebastian shook his head. "I didn't want to let them go, either, but...I had no other choice! I was just bluffing back there. I can't manage another attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If they don't leave, we'll be the ones who end up dead!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gasped, another spurt of blood following his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's anxiety grew as he noticed Sebastian's condition worsening, teetering on the brink of unconsciousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, he channeled the Light of Redemption, managing to stabilize his grandfather's state, if only for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The rest of the Augustine family observed anxiously, their expressions a mirror of dread.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian mustered a faint smile. "Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere just yet!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze swept across everyone in the room, resolve blazing in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With grim determination, he handed the Godfather's Scepter to Osborne, a weighty gesture filled with significance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian declared, his voice ringing out with authority, "Listen up, everyone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Effective immediately, I am stepping down as the head of the Augustine family. My grandson, Osborne, will take over as the new patriarch! Not only that, but I'm also entrusting the Draco Group to him. From now on, everyone must follow his orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne is the new Godfather!"</p></div>
