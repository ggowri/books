        <h1>Chapter 2195 Fierce Battle With Lord Malevolence-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne was hit by an intense cold wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if his blood was turning to ice in his veins, and his very soul and thoughts were about to be entombed in ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened drastically. He quickly summoned his Sacred Power to form a shield around himself, which offered a bit of respite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the seriousness of the situation still loomed large.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Lord Malevolence hadn't even launched his full-fledged attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn, freeze him!" Lord Malevolence roared, a malicious grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, a beam of light shot out from the dragon horn, wrapping Osborne in its icy embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the light hit him, Osborne's heart pounded with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that his defense formed by Sacred Power was gradually being frozen solid, cracking like delicate glass under the mounting pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an incredibly terrifying freezing force! It can even freeze my Sacred Power!" Osborne exclaimed, his eyes bulging with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sacred Power was his lifeline, the only thing enabling him to narrow the colossal cultivation gap between himself and Lord Malevolence. If Lord Malevolence could nullify it, then his situation was dire indeed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and pushed his Sacred Power to its absolute limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can freeze my Sacred Power? You're delusional!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Sacred Power roared to life as he fought back against the frigid light emanating from the Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn, determined not to let it paralyze him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence let out a sinister chuckle. "Impressive, I must say. You can actually withstand the freezing power of the Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But for how long? The more you squander your Sacred Power, the closer you are to becoming a helpless prey in my hands. Once your energy is depleted, I'll crush you without the slightest effort!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Lord Malevolence's words, Osborne couldn't suppress a sneaky smirk inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yearned to tell the villain that this level of energy depletion was a piece of cake for him. He could endure for a year, a decade, or even a century without exhausting his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was he so confident? It was because he was the proud possessor of the Chaotic Spiritual Root!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, numerous shadowy roots started to snake out from Osborne's body. Only he could see them, and they glowed with a vivid green light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Chaotic Spiritual Root in action!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chaotic Spiritual Root latched onto the void and began to suck in energy non-stop. It replenished Osborne's Sacred Power, ensuring it remained at its optimal level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, a wave of relief washed over Osborne. He was deeply grateful that before he returned to Celestara Planet, Primordial had assisted him in merging with the fragment of the World Tree, endowing him with the Chaotic Spiritual Root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without it, his situation would be hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the current rate of energy consumption, he'd be completely drained in less than half an hour, leaving him an easy target for Lord Malevolence's attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed a torrent of his Sacred Power, colliding head-on with the bone-chilling force emanating from Lord Malevolence's Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two forces were locked in a brutal war of attrition, and the onlookers held their breaths, their eyes fixed on the intense spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The contrast in the atmosphere was stark. On Lord Malevolence's side, there was an air of overconfidence. His minions were relaxed, fully convinced of their master's impending victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Osborne's allies were on pins and needles, their hearts pounding with anxiety about the battle's outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the minutes ticked by like hours, a subtle change came over Lord Malevolence's face. He had been so sure that Osborne's divine power would fade rapidly. In his mind, it was only a matter of time before Osborne's energy signature weakened, making Osborne an easy target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his utter shock, even after all this time, Osborne's energy signature remained as strong as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the energy drain was having no effect on him whatsoever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What sorcery is this?!" Lord Malevolence hissed under his breath, his forehead creased with a mix of disbelief and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence let out a disdainful snort and said, "Damn it! I underestimated you once more! Clearly, the Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn alone won't be enough to take you down. Let's see how you fare against the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I simply won't accept that you can endure the combined might of both dragon horns!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words left his lips, the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn started to radiate an eerie, menacing glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared at the top of his lungs, "Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn! Reduce him to ashes!"</span></p></div>
