        <h1>Chapter 64 She Is Desperate</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If he is still alive, he may already have become Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s face darkened as she thought about the possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a bodyguard.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley looked disdainful. &ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe has too many bodyguards, at least hundreds. Who does Osborne think he is? Do you think as noble as Ms. Radcliffe will like him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, Ms. Donna Radcliffe is obviously very wary of Osborne. Even if Osborne becomes Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard, he probably won&rsquo;t be able to do it for long. Maybe he&rsquo;ll die not long after.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia nodded. This was what she was thinking. Osborne was just an ordinary man. Even if he was Clarissa&rsquo;s savior, nothing romantic could have happened between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two of them were not from the same world at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They predicted Clarissa would never fall in love with a divorced man like Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Okay. Let&rsquo;s change the subject. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about him anymore.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley nodded. He looked at Ophelia and said, &ldquo;Our wedding is not far away. I want to choose a set of top-quality jewelry for you so that you can become the most beautiful and most splendid bride in Mayby City.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Surprise and thrill filled Ophelia&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley continued, &ldquo;At the Draco Auction, I saw that you seemed to like the Ocean Whisper Sapphire. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s worth 100 million dollars, and it was bought by Ms. Radcliffe. Although I am the heir of the Ashford family, those old guys in The Wise Order will definitely not allow me to spend 100 million dollars buying jewelry.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia frowned. &ldquo;Where are you going with this?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley smiled slightly. &ldquo;So, I want to make a set of jewelry for you. Don&rsquo;t forget what my family does. We deal in diamond raw materials.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It just so happens that my diamond dealing market has recently received a large number of uncut natural diamonds. They are all carefully selected. I have asked a master craftsman to look at a few of them. There are definitely top-quality diamonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;And the price is only 15 million dollars! I want to spend my own money to buy them. When I cut out the finest diamonds, I will find the best designer to design a jewelry set for you to use at our wedding.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Wesley finished speaking, Ophelia&rsquo;s eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Are you sure those diamonds are pure? Natural pure diamonds are not easy to find these days.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley said confidently, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, there will be. Believe me. If I fail, I will go to the Ashford family warehouse and get you the finest ones.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s heart beat fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Okay, then we&rsquo;ll go to your family&rsquo;s diamond dealing market.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s heart leaped up for joy, and he reached out to hold Ophelia&rsquo;s hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Ophelia dodged away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at Wesley and reminded him, &ldquo;I know what you want to do, but now is not the right time. However, if you can really find top-quality diamonds today, maybe I will do as you say.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley felt a surge of lust in his veins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Okay. Remember what you said.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s tone was confident. He was already consumed with thoughts, mainly about how he would make Ophelia moan in bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;To the diamond dealing market!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The market was located in the suburbs of Mayby City. It is a huge place with dealers and cutters that covers an area of sixteen acres, and next to it was the Mayby City Law Enforcement Bureau.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In addition, the Ashford family also hired a security company to ensure the safety of the market.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, the raw diamonds were extremely valuable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The diamonds ranged from thousands of dollars to tens of millions. If anything happened to them, the loss would be unimaginable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Ashford family had become one of the top wealthy families in Mayby City because of this market. It brought hundreds of millions in profits every year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, Wesley and Ophelia&rsquo;s convoy arrived the place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as they got off, another convoy arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s face suddenly turned cold, and she snorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Why are the people from the Luna Jewelry here? What happened to Alison? Does she want to take risks in here, too?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s gaze was icy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley chuckled. &ldquo;Maybe she panicked. My family has not sold diamonds to Luna Jewelry for a while. If she doesn&rsquo;t think of a solution, her company will have nothing to sell.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia lifted the corners of her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;So she came here to get the diamonds she needed for Luna Jewelry? She is getting dumb and desperate, isn&rsquo;t she? She&rsquo;s practically giving money away.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s grin moved into a smirk. &ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s giving money away, and we will take it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Both of them laughed in disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison finally exited the car and was surprised as she saw Wesley and Ophelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she didn&rsquo;t say anything. Instead, she ran to the other side and opened the car door for Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne got out of the car slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, Wesley and Ophelia froze in a daze.</p></div>
