        <h1>Chapter 1803 A Sudden Realization</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes earlier, the arena was alive with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd of countless spectators from various clans was on the edge, their adrenaline pumping as they watched the intense battles unfold. Whether it was the one-on-one showdown between Caesar and Osborne or the chaotic skirmish between Tristram's group and Anastasia's, the action was nothing short of electrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a million eyes were glued to the spectacle, struggling to keep up with the rapid exchanges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, their focus zeroed in on Caesar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of him being pushed back was astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Caesar was one of the Five Brilliant Scions of the Paramount Supreme Clan&mdash;a title that marked him as one of the top five prodigies of the younger generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With access to boundless resources, he had reached the late stage of Deity King at a young age, surpassing many seasoned veterans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the onlookers, Caesar was invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only ones capable of defeating him were the other four Scions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, being suppressed by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne unleashed his Spatial Clone technique, summoning eight clones to overwhelm Caesar, gasps of disbelief rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, Theodore, really is the strongest!" one spectator exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Caesar, at the late stage of Deity King, is being dominated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, isn't he just at the early stage of Deity King?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of monster is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was utterly mesmerized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, aboard a Supreme Malevolence Airship, an old man watched the fight with a grave expression, his brow furrowed in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He declared coldly, "This man cannot be allowed to live!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It would be best if Caesar could take him down on the arena. If he can't, I'll have to intervene personally. A talent like this could only be matched by Egbert, the top-ranked among the Five Brilliant Scions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he escapes to the West Zone and grows stronger, he'll become a significant headache for our Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were fixed on Osborne, filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hubery Eldridge, Caesar is being suppressed! Caesar is one of the Five Brilliant Scions; his defeat would be a disgrace to our clan. Should we intervene now?" said a middle-aged man beside him, worry etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery Eldridge merely smiled, unfazed, "No need for that! Caesar won't lose. He's wearing the Supreme Sovereign's Armor, which puts him in an unbeatable position! This Theodore may be impressive, but he hasn't found a way to breach the armor's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caesar only looks like he's struggling; in reality, he can't lose! If we step in now, people will think he's already lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let him feel some pressure; it will benefit his growth! The esteemed Lord Malevolence has high hopes for our Five Brilliant Scions. Caesar needs to get stronger to meet those expectations!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Hubery turned his gaze back to the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caesar, don't disappoint the esteemed Lord Malevolence! Defeating the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings is a task you must accomplish! If you can't beat them even with the Supreme Sovereign's Armor, you don't deserve to be one of the Five Brilliant Scions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he remained calm, observing the unfolding battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne activated the Eclipse of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery abruptly stood up, his eyes wide with disbelief as he stared at the arena shrouded in darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's face turned serious. "This is... the Eclipse Realm?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipse Realm? How can this damn brat comprehend it? Even among the Five Brilliant Scions, only Egbert has barely grasped it! Does he have some connection to the God of Night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery frowned tightly but remained unflustered. "So you can wield the Eclipse Realm, what of it? It can't break through the Supreme Sovereign's Armor! Caesar is still invincible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When your power runs out, it's Caesar's turn to strike back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings? Ha! Pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery remained calm despite being unable to see the arena. In his mind, Caesar was bound to win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Caesar had the Supreme Sovereign's Armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Minutes later, Bryce severed Caesar's head with a single sword strike in the Eclipse Realm. Far away in the Central Zone, at the Eldridge family residence, Caesar's soul token burst into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shattering of the soul token meant Caesar was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, who was waiting in the Supreme Malevolence Airship for good news from Caesar, received a message from the Eldridge family. His face contorted with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you say Caesar is dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible! He has the Supreme Sovereign's Armor; how could he die? It's not happening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery leaped to his feet, his eyes wide with incredulity as he stared towards the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eclipse Realm still enveloped the fighting area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a burst of anger, Hubery bolted out of the airship and charged towards the Eclipse Realm, bellowing, "The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, you're dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dared kill Caesar? You're all going to die!"</span></p></div>
