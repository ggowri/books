        <h1>Chapter 2213 They Have Been Sold-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the news, Osborne's eyes lit up with a flicker of hope. The prospect of finding his parents, even as he stood on the brink of breaking through to Ascension Seven, made him suppress his advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he realized it was bad news, his expression shifted to one of tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and asked, "What's going on? Just tell me&mdash;I can handle it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The worst-case scenario was that his parents had been dead for ages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a bitter truth Osborne wasn't ready to accept, but he knew he could bear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa didn't hesitate, sensing his urgency. "Osborne, if our investigation hasn't gone awry, </span><span>it seems your parents... they might have been sold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sold?" Osborne echoed, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They aren't dead; they have been sold?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What kind of situation is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa continued, "Based on your orders, the Empire of the Sun has been frantically searching for them. Various factions are eager to please you and have been putting in a lot of effort, but there's been no trace. It's as if your parents never set foot on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Things remained a mystery until recently when the Mystic Feather Clan offered a clue. They suspect that over the past century, the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Demonic Dragon Clan have been secretly running a slave-trading operation. They've been snatching up talented warriors from the Human Community on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet and selling them to the dark forces on other planets in exchange for resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They think that right after your parents landed on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet, they were probably captured by the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Demonic Dragon Clan and then sold off to other worlds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Based on this lead, we dug deeper and sure enough, found that the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Paramount Supreme Clan are indeed involved in this slave-trading racket. After some... 'encouragement', we managed to track down one of the guys who might have personally captured your parents and sold them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of her hand, Isa conjured up a member of the Demonic Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked </span><span>like</span><span> </span><span>a complete mess, weak as a kitten, clearly having gone through a lot of torture and interrogation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Osborne, the man immediately pleaded, "Your Majesty! Please, have mercy on me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were just following the Paramount Supreme Clan's orders to sell slaves from the Human Community. We had no idea your parents were among those we sold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Majesty, please!" The member of the Demonic Dragon Clan </span><span>sobbed,</span><span> his voice thick with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face clouded over, and he ignored the man's pleas. Instead, he reached out, grabbed the man, and without a moment's hesitation, snapped his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, activating his Satan's Eye, Osborne delved into the Demonic Dragon Clan member's memories and locked them deep in his own mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes and quickly scanned through the memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a surge of emotion hit him, and he jolted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face brightened with excitement; he had indeed seen his parents in that memory. It was over twenty years ago, shortly after they'd arrived on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet from Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their luck had run out when they bumped into a hunting party from the Demonic Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way for them to escape, and they were captured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's parents were then locked up in a secret place, surrounded by other talented slaves from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they'd rounded up enough captives, a Supreme Malevolence Airship showed up </span><span>at the prison, all set to take them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were going to be sold off to other planets!</span></p></div>
