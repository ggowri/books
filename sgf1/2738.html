        <h1>Chapter 2605 Honorary Elder-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was completely stunned by Adriana's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his view, Adriana's actions seemed a bit crazy. Just for a junior who wasn't even an Empyrean Sacredness, she was willing to oppose the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one would be this crazy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least Osborne felt that his relationship with Adriana wasn't that close. Would Adriana really be willing to risk the entire Fairy Moon Sect just because she believed in him and go crazy with him?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's impossible!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath to calm himself and asked, "Ms. Alba, may I know the real reason?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana heard this and immediately laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You little guy, why are you so sharp? As expected, nothing can fool you! Alright, I admit that believing in you is only part of the reason. Another part is because of Isa, Clarissa, and the others..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isa and Clarissa's talents exceeded my expectations. They will definitely become the pillars of the Fairy Moon Sect in the future! Even if I leave the Fairy Moon Sect, they will quickly be able to support it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With your relationship with them... if you ever clash with the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, no matter what, they will definitely get involved and come to help you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't possibly restrain them! Doing so would only make them hate me... So, unless I drive them all out of the Fairy Moon Sect, sooner or later, there will be a conflict with the Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's expression turned cold. "The reasons I mentioned earlier are not the most crucial ones! The real reason is... even without you, the Fairy Moon Sect would still have to clash with the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was utterly astonished upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why? The Fairy Moon Sect is doing fine now, so why would it clash with the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana said calmly, "Because the Royal Family won't let me live! They won't let the Fairy Moon Sect survive either! To the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the Fairy Moon Sect is simply too powerful! And the Fairy Moon Sect's goal has always been to become the fourth top-tier power on the Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But the Glorious Divine Kingdom won't allow such a thing to happen! After all, another top-tier power would take away a portion of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's interests!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, not long after the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ended, Emperor Frederick approached me and gave me an ultimatum! Either I marry Emperor Frederick, bear his children, and make the Fairy Moon Sect a subordinate force of the Royal Family. Or..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family will take action against the Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Adriana's face turned extremely grim. "Emperor Frederick, he is a ruthless man! In his eyes, there is only power and a higher cultivation level! How could I marry him? How could I bear his children? And the Fairy Moon Sect... it could never become a vassal of the Royal Family!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I can never agree!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although he said that as long as I agreed, he would reveal the secret of Necropolis City to me, a way to quickly break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness like him! He tried to tempt me, but I still refused him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The conflict between the Fairy Moon Sect and the Royal Family is now inevitable! And Emperor Frederick's deadline for me... is right after coming out of Necropolis City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, if I still refuse to marry him, bear his children, and make the Fairy Moon Sect a vassal of the Royal Family... he will personally destroy the Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p></div>
