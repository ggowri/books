        <h1>Chapter 2664 Encounter with Hendrix-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head and didn't think much about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they were really teleported to the central area of the Ancient Battlefield, then it's just their bad luck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he doesn't need to worry too much about them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had already used the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to replicate their life essence. Even if they really died inside the Skyfall Casket, as long as Osborne remains alive, he can resurrect them after leaving the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in that case, they would miss out on the opportunities and treasures within the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Eighth Skyfall Casket seals an Ancient Battlefield. As long as they kill the astral projections that cyclically appear on the Ancient Battlefield, they can quickly enhance their cultivation level and strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they miss such an opportunity, it would be a real pity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "I hope they can all survive and gain something."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne continued the slaughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The area he was in now was not the edge of the Ancient Battlefield, nor the center, and the surrounding astral projections were not strong enough to kill him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he was very safe here unless the environment of the Ancient Battlefield changed again, or the surrounding astral projections became stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "From the time I entered the Ancient Battlefield to when the environment changed, it was a total of four days. If I include the day I did nothing, that makes five days. Does the environment change every five days?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't sure, so he planned to wait five days to observe the situation. During these five days, he aimed to kill as many astral projections as possible and reach Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, three days passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had killed all the easily defeated astral projections around him. At this point, he was close to reaching Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne's expression turned serious because he sensed an unusual energy fluctuation. Immediately, he activated Satan's Eye and looked over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne's eyes filled with excitement because he saw a living person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been in the Eighth Skyfall Casket for seven days, but he had been slaughtering and improving his strength in this Ancient Battlefield the entire time, never encountering anyone else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he speculated that this Ancient Battlefield was incredibly vast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, more than two hundred people had entered the Eighth Skyfall Casket, yet he had traversed such a vast area of the Ancient Battlefield without encountering a single person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, everyone must be separated by a great distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne finally encountered the first living person, and it was someone he knew.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be more precise, that person was his enemy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he saw that person, Osborne's gaze turned icy cold, with intense anger and killing intent appearing on his face. At this moment, he even lost interest in the astral projections around him that could enhance his strength, and his eyes were fixed solely on that person in the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And that person was Hendrix!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hendrix was 180 thousand miles away from Osborne, also exerting all his strength to kill astral projections. However, his killing speed was much slower than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Hendrix was at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, nearing Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, a higher cultivation level than Osborne's current state, the astral projections around him had all reached Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. With Hendrix's strength, he couldn't handle them at all and could even find himself in danger if he wasn't careful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only do as Osborne did, waiting until those astral projections were severely injured and on the brink of death by others before suddenly delivering the final blow.</span></p></div>
