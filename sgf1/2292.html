        <h1>Chapter 2248 Provocation-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim's icy words sent a ripple of intense murmurs through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is toast! He's really pissed Vadim off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vadim follows through on his threats. If Osborne runs into him in the ring, he's going to be in serious trouble&mdash;Vadim won't hold back; he'll make sure he's badly hurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can dodge Vadim for a bit longer and score a few wins, he might luck his way into the top ten! Otherwise, he's definitely looking at a last-place finish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over! The biggest dark horse is about to crash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does he expect, acting all cocky and betting on himself to win like Vadim?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The comments caused Osborne to halt mid-step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to face Vadim, his voice calm but probing. "Have I offended you somehow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim sneered at him in contempt. "You? An Ascension Eight inner disciple? You're not even worth my anger for whatever offense you think you've committed. I just can't stand having scumbags like you tainting the Sect Tournament!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see if you've got the balls to hold your own when we face off in the arena. If you do, maybe I'll start to think of you differently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pretty full of yourself, aren't you? You think you can take me down and kick me out of the tournament? I'm actually starting to look forward to crossing paths with you in the ring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because when that happens, I'll give you exactly what you're asking for! It'll be so ironic to see a supposed championship hopeful end up in last place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim's expression faltered for a second, and his face turned grim. "Trash, you really think you've got what it takes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see if you've got the goods!" Osborne retorted, locking eyes with Vadim unflinchingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't itching for a fight, but he sure as hell wasn't one to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Vadim was the hot-shot favorite to win the Sect Tournament and, on top of that, the nephew of Lenny. But he'd have to up his game if he thought he could rattle Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the arena, it was anyone's guess who'd come out on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! Just great!" Vadim </span><span>sneered,</span><span> his laughter laced with venom. "We'll see how this all shakes out! I can't wait to watch you, an Ascension Eight loser, eat dust behind me. Just remember&mdash;don't come crying for mercy when it's your turn to get thrashed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting for you in the ring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Vadim spun on his heel and walked away, leaving behind a menacing aura that hung thick in the air, palpable to everyone in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People looked at Osborne with a mix of pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That dark </span><span>horse is</span><span> toast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's poked the bear. I can already imagine the beating he's going to take in the arena!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't wait to see it go down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne brushed off the whispers and walked away. To him, Vadim's provocation was nothing but a fleeting annoyance; he couldn't have cared less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he reached the area at the foot of the arena and waited in silence while the buzz of conversation around him persisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before too long, the high-ranking figures of the sect started to show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peak Lords, Elders, and even Lenny himself made their way onto the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela also joined the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this Sect Tournament, just as she'd foreseen, the other disciples from Peak Seven had completely bombed; not a single one of them had made it into the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Osborne's unexpected success, at least Peak Seven had a representative. Otherwise, they would have been in for even more humiliation.</span></p></div>
