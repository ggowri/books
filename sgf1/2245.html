        <h1>Chapter 2218 Take Action-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Set sail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Set sail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a soft hum, a hexagram formation materialized in the clearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It glowed brighter and brighter, engulfing the metal boxes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a Spatial Translocator!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank.</span><br><span>So the Phantom Tide Demon Sect isn't keeping these slaves for themselves. They're shipping them off somewhere else. This just made things a whole lot more complicated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even if my parents were sold to the Phantom Tide Demon Sect over twenty years ago, finding them now is like looking for a needle in a haystack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the harsh reality dawned on him, his spirits plummeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's voice cut through the tense atmosphere, laced with urgency. "Osborne, should we make our move now? If we don't act fast, those slaves will be teleported away! And their fate..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned steely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and said, "Let's do it! Even though these slaves aren't our problem, we can't just stand by and watch now that we've found them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he fixed his eyes on Vince, then turned to the imposing figure in heavy armor standing behind Vince.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King&mdash;the most powerful being in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne used his Satan's Eye to see through the armor and recognized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Shelvin, one of the seven core leaders of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, you deal with Vince! I'll take on Shelvin! We need to strike like lightning&mdash;don't give them a chance to send out an alarm!" Osborne commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded. "Roger that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's rock and roll!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne and Isa sprang into action. Just as the Spatial Translocator was about to kick into gear, Osborne materialized out of thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed a finger at the device, and poof! The Translocator ground to a sudden halt, and the glowing hexagram formation vanished in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince's excitement fizzled into confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there, rooted to the spot, totally bewildered about what had just gone down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shelvin was a lot quicker on the uptake. He roared, "Damn it! Mr. Vince Brunson, look out! We've got trouble! Someone's trying to mess with us! Contact Mr. Brunson right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he locked eyes with Osborne, his gaze blazing with homicidal rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him out!" he bellowed and lunged at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed. "You're just at Ascension Nine level, and you think you can take me down? You're in for a rude awakening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne unleashed a thunderous palm strike at Shelvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sacred Power raged as his hand connected with Shelvin, shattering the divine power defense in the blink of an eye. However, the thick armor Shelvin was wearing absorbed the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what the hell?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attack, though not at full throttle, was no joke&mdash;no run-of-the-mill Ascension Nine warrior could take it. After all, he'd just reached Ascension Seven, way stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when he was Ascension Four, he'd taken down an Ascension Ten warrior like Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking out an Ascension Nine should've been a piece of cake, but here he was, shocked that Shelvin had weathered his strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared daggers at Shelvin's armor, his eyes icy cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That armor's got some serious defense! But you know what? It won't be your savior! Unless that armor's a Sacred Artifact, you're toast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He launched another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, a massive wave of Sacred Power coursed through him, forming a gigantic hand that came crashing down on Shelvin like a meteor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shelvin's eyes popped out in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening explosion shook the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strike sent Shelvin flying through the air. His armor shattered into a million pieces under the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted from Shelvin's mouth as he hit the ground and lay there, unable to move a muscle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the other side of the battlefield, Isa had also jumped into the fray. Enveloped in darkness, she darted towards Vince at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the darkness exploded all around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince, an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, didn't stand a ghost of a chance against her. Isa had all the strength of Osborne's past life and could go toe-to-toe with Ascension Ten foes like Lord Malevolence for quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have a prayer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince was thrown back, blood pouring from his lips as he crumpled to the ground, unconscious.</span></p></div>
