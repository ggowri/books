        <h1>Chapter 2569 The Secret of the Sacrifice-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was already extremely familiar with the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. Since the ceremony took place every ten years, Osborne had experienced it dozens of times in his previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was nothing interesting to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick would follow the ancient procedure, first worshiping the ancestors, then slaughtering the offerings to invoke the sacrificial power. Half of the descending multicolored sacrificial power would be absorbed by Supreme Overlord Mount, while the other half would be absorbed by Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Doing so could enhance Frederick's strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every king of the Glorious Divine Kingdom valued the decennial sacrifice greatly, as it allowed them to grow stronger more quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with average talent, they could eventually become a supreme warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With more sacrifices, they could even surpass their limits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, perhaps because Osborne was stronger than in the previous life, he sensed something different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where does the power of this sacrifice come from?" Thinking this, Osborne secretly activated Satan's Eye and looked at the seven-colored light descending from the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These seven-colored lights were a special energy, not appearing out of thin air but transmitted through a Space-Time Rift.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the previous life, Osborne had no spatial power or time powers, so he noticed nothing unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, Osborne felt something was off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The power of this sacrifice is actually transmitted from a very distant place. Where does this Space-Time Rift lead to?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, at this moment, he was surrounded by warriors, so he couldn't fully use his spatial power to investigate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Primordial's voice echoed in his mind. "This Space-Time Rift naturally leads to the deeper parts of the universe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne was stunned. "The deeper parts of the universe?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said calmly, "This sacrifice is to seek power from a powerful being in the deeper parts of the universe. It seems the Glorious Divine Kingdom is not as simple as we thought. It is connected to a powerful being in the deeper parts of the universe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perhaps that is the ancestor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. He didn't die but entered the deeper parts of the universe. Through special sacrificial methods, his descendants can connect with him. Then, he sends back some power to help his descendants enhance their strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, due to the vast distance, most of the energy is consumed along the way, leaving only a small portion for his descendants."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even so, being able to channel power back from the depths of the universe to help his descendants is already remarkable. In the mid-level regions of the universe, he is considered a master."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne felt incredibly shocked. "The secret of the sacrifice is actually like this? The ancestor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom didn't die?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He entered the deeper parts of the universe? The sacrificial methods he left behind were actually to help his descendants enhance their strength, ensuring the Glorious Divine Kingdom could continue? Such methods exist in this world?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This isn't actually difficult," Primordial continued explaining, "Let me use you as an example. If you wanted to help your parents and relatives on Celestara Planet enhance their strength, you could use a similar method. You could leave a special Sacred Artifact on Celestara Planet. From time to time, you could sense the Sacred Artifact and remotely transmit some power to it, then let the Sacred Artifact share part of that power with your parents and relatives."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sacrifice is quite similar to this method. If I'm not mistaken, this Supreme Overlord Mount is the key to the success of the sacrifice. This Supreme Overlord Mount has an extremely strong connection with the ancestor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. So, even if he's in the deeper parts of the universe, he can still remotely transmit power back."</span></p></div>
