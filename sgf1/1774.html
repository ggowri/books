        <h1>Chapter 1773 The Battle in the Dimensional Microcosm</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside Hope Haven, energy chaotically erupted as battles raged across three distinct arenas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne floated effortlessly in mid-air, and his gaze swept over the unfolding chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one battlefield, Osborne's seven Spatial Clones were mercilessly pummeling Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Kendra, Bryce, Hannah, and Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seven warriors were giving it their all, their powers colliding in a dazzling display of light and energy. The Supreme Malevolence Sword and Supreme Malevolence Shield flashed brilliantly, yet they still found themselves on the receiving end of a relentless beating from Osborne's clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they didn't throw in the towel. They were constantly brainstorming ways to turn the tide against Osborne's Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second battlefield was even more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over 48 hundred Blood Demon members were locked in a fierce struggle against hundreds of thousands of Dark Undeads. Despite the Blood Demon's impeccable coordination and teamwork&mdash;three hundred of their members had even reached the Deity King level&mdash;they were still overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of the Dark Undead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could kill the undead at a rapid pace, but for everyone they took down, more seemed to take its place. Blood Demon warriors were getting blasted apart, only to revive and return to the fray, yet they remained at a disadvantage, unable to gain any ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final battlefield featured Sebastian, Divine Shadow, and God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their opponent was a single Spatial Clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they had all broken through to Deity King, the gap in potential and talent left them struggling compared to Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They surrounded the clone, but it was like trying to catch smoke with their bare hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce clashes continued for an entire day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhaustion hung heavy in the air, yet Osborne remained aloft, unscathed, and unyielding. He controlled Spatial Clones and Dark Undeads with ease, effortlessly suppressing the efforts of his friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occasionally, he would call out advice, pointing out flaws in their strategies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Bryce collapsed, breathing heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, that's enough! I'm done for today. You're just a freak of nature! I thought we'd made enough progress to narrow the gap a bit, but it's only grown wider!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't even have to lift a finger to keep us all pinned down! If we keep this up, I'm going to lose all my confidence," Bryce said a little helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, equally worn out, chimed in, "I'm done too! Seriously, Osborne, you're way too overpowered!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her power targeted the soul, and attacking Osborne's Spatial Clones meant attacking his soul directly. But Osborne's soul was so strong that no matter how hard Zoe tried, she couldn't make a dent, which meant his clones remained untouched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to rely on divine power for her attacks, and after a grueling battle, she was completely drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila, Kendra, Diana, and Hannah soon followed suit, stopping in their tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances filled with helplessness and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that they just couldn't win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's seven clones were simply too much for them to handle, and most of the time, they were just dodging and defending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disparity was crushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew that Osborne could create up to sixty-four Spatial Clones at once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he unleashed them all on them, they'd be wiped out in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Anastasia stepped back as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sparks of lightning surrounding her faded, and she too was panting, yet her eyes sparkled with excitement as if she hadn't had her fill of the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Osborne, how did I do?" Anastasia asked with a playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne appeared by her side, giving her head a gentle pat. "Impressive work! Your Thunder Power poses a significant threat to my Spatial Clones, but you need to be faster and sneakier with your moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't give your enemy any room to react! If you can master that, you'll make short work of those clones. After all, their defenses are pretty basic compared to yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia fell into deep thought, then nodded with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll keep pushing myself harder!" she said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Hannah activated her life power, and a flood of vitality surged into everyone's bodies. Their wounds healed rapidly, and soon enough, they were back on their feet, full of energy once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, Sebastian, Divine Shadow, and God of Star had already wrapped up their own battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They strolled over, and their eyes were filled with warmth as they watched the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian reached for Divine Shadow's hand and chuckled, "These kids are something else, aren't they? We're getting old, Divine Shadow. We can't keep up with their pace anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow shot him a playful glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, come on, Sebastian. You're just trying to brag about your grandson, aren't you? These kids ganged up on him, and still, he wiped the floor with them. Even Mila got a taste of his fists."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian chuckled awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Osborne can be a bit rough around the edges, you know? No mercy for anyone. I'll have a word with him about that later. But Mila's been making some serious strides lately. Her fire elemental power packs quite a punch&mdash;second only to Anastasia's Thunder Power in terms of raw attack strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow's expression lit up with pride.</span></p></div>
