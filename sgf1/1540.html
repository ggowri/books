        <h1>Chapter 1539 Standing Against the Supreme Malevolence Sword</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Tobey was dumbfounded by what he had just witnessed, Osborne couldn't help but feel a deep sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here were two talented Celestial Deities from the Demonic Dragon Clan, both powerful enough that they should measure up to someone like Hannah. Yet, before </span><span>him, they crumbled under a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My strength has now reached the level of an ordinary Deity Overlord. And that's just with my Thunder Power. If I tapped into my spatial or dark power, I'd be even stronger!" Osborne reflected, reveling in the power coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering his current capabilities, Osborne felt a surge of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had only just barely crossed over into the Transcendent Deity realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the initial stage of Transcendent Deity, he was already manifesting strength comparable to a Deity Overlord&mdash;a feat so astounding that no one would ever believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, the benchmark for a super genius was to defeat a typical Deity Overlord while still at the peak Celestial Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, demonstrating such prowess right after his breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calling him a super genius hardly captured the extent of his talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he felt immense gratitude toward Isa, who had guided him down this unique and extraordinary path of cultivation. Without Isa's influence, he certainly wouldn't possess the strength he had now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned his gaze to Tobey, whose face was still marred by disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sly smirk, he taunted, "So, Tobey of the Paramount Supreme Clan, a peak Celestial Deity. How much stronger are you compared to those two? How many hits do you think you can take from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey snapped back to reality, his expression darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lowly human, how foolish you are! I underestimated you! So, you've broken through to Deity Overlord, haven't you? There's no way you could take them down in one strike otherwise. You must have some tricks up your sleeve to hide the true state of your Divine Flame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I even thought you had failed your breakthrough! But it only matters so much; I am Tobey, from the Paramount Supreme Clan! You think you can defeat me? Don't make me laugh! That's a pipe dream!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tobey reached into his Dimensional Bag and pulled out the Supreme Malevolence Sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dreadful surge of energy radiated from the sword, filling the air with an oppressive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey had believed that Osborne had broken through to the Deity Overlord realm, so he couldn't be bothered to explain and decided to let the misunderstanding stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely looked with astonishment at the Malevolence Sword in Tobey's hand, sensing an utterly terrifying aura emanating from it, an aura that was even stronger than that of a top-grade divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that an Ultimate Divine Artifact? No way&mdash;could it be the legendary Supreme Malevolence Sword?" he murmured, almost in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey grinned coldly. "Finally, you show some knowledge! Yes, this is the Supreme Malevolence Sword! It rivals an Ultimate Divine Artifact and, in certain aspects, exceeds it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This sword is forged from techniques derived from the divine peak! It's incredibly sharp and has immense penetration power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, you've tapped into Deity Overlord strength, but you've only just crossed that threshold! I'm a genius of the Paramount Supreme Clan, armed with the Supreme Malevolence Sword. I'll slay you here and seal my reputation as a super genius!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fiery determination blazing in his eyes, Tobey stepped forward, ready for battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>chuckled,</span><span> his skepticism fueled by Tobey's bravado. "You think you're going to kill me and make a name for yourself as a super genius? Really? You believe that </span><span>just because you've got an Ultimate Divine Artifact in your hand, you can challenge me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's pretty naive of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about this: I'll let you have one free shot. I want to feel just how sharp your Supreme Malevolence Sword really is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he summoned a suit of armor made of swirling thunder, the bolts sparking furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne beckoned Tobey, ready to engage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! I'm only defending now. Let's see if your Supreme Malevolence Sword can actually hurt me!" Osborne declared, a confident grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey's expression twisted with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you underestimate me? You want me to take a free shot? No one talks to me like that! If you're looking for a death wish, I'll be more than happy to oblige!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tobey tightened his grip on the Supreme Malevolence Sword and charged at Osborne with fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll cut you down with a single strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of divine power erupted around Tobey, pouring into the Supreme Malevolence Sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with energy as he unleashed his attack. "Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a terrifying beam of light shot forth from the sword, slicing through the air with blinding speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Supreme Malevolence Sword struck Osborne's thunderous armor with a force that sent </span><span>shock-waves</span><span> rippling outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power was staggering, and the ground trembled beneath them. Yet, Osborne stood his ground, seemingly unfazed. The sword cleaved into his lightning armor, splitting it open but failing to break through completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey froze, disbelief washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "My full-powered strike, combined with the razor-sharp Supreme Malevolence Sword, hasn't managed to breach this guy's defenses?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is that even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>chuckled,</span><span> his confidence unwavering. "The Supreme Malevolence Sword is indeed sharp!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But unfortunately, your strength just doesn't cut it. If you were anywhere near Hannah's level, you might have actually hurt me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can't waste any more time on you. That Supreme Malevolence Sword? It's mine now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you? You're as good as dead!"</span></p></div>
