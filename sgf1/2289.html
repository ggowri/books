        <h1>Chapter 2246 Underdog-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Top ten..." Angela shook her head, a healthy dose of doubt creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne's cultivation level was way too low. In the upcoming knockout rounds, every contender would be pitted against each other, and each match would be an uphill battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To snag a spot in the top ten, he'd have to win at least half of those fights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Osborne have what it takes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela wasn't buying it. The higher one climbed the cultivation ladder, the steeper the challenges got. Those who could leap two cultivation ranks at Ascension Three or Four to defeat their foes often struggled to even jump one rank at Ascension Eight or Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, an Eighth Ascension Supernal Deity King, had managed to take down a dozen run-of-the-mill Ascension Ten opponents with the quasi-Sacred Artifact, the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow. But that was a one-in-a-million feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His future foes would be stronger, more clued-in about his abilities, and extra cautious. Winning would be an absolute Herculean task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lenny, the leader of the Mystic Sirius Sect, said with a wide grin, "Angela, Osborne from Peak Seven is something else! I noticed he's still an inner disciple, only at Ascension Eight, yet he was the first to sail through his group like it was nothing. He's got serious promise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, the opponents in Group Five were a bit of a let-down. And with that quasi-Sacred Artifact bow of his, his attack power is off the charts. Still, he's got real potential! I reckon he stands a good chance of making the top ten and representing us at the city duel in Tempest Fortress City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen, you've done an amazing job guiding him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela couldn't help but furrow her brows at his words. She was itching to blurt out that she hadn't taught Osborne a single thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd only joined Mystic Sirius Sect's Peak Seven a measly two weeks ago, and during that time, he'd holed himself up in seclusion and hadn't been seen at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she bit her tongue and just nodded. "His combat skills are truly something. Beating a bunch of Ascension Ten opponents, no matter the situation, shows his talent and promise. It's just a pity..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shook her head, a touch of regret on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ms. Alba personally invited Osborne to join the Fairy Moon Sect and even offered to take him on as her direct disciple. But in the end, he turned her down. Otherwise, he'd be a disciple of the Fairy Moon Sect by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a pity about what?" Lenny asked, looking confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unaware that Isa, Clarissa, and Anastasia had almost joined Mystic Sirius Sect as inner disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Angela hadn't spotted their potential and snatched them up first, Mystic Sirius Sect would have gained a whole new set of Class SS talents along with a Celestial Progeny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing!" Angela replied coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela knew Lenny had feelings for her, but she wasn't interested. She was only at Mystic Sirius Sect for training. Once it was over, she planned to make a clean break and have nothing more to do with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's just get back to watching the matches, okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bethan from Peak Two has wrapped up her group matches and made it through!" Angela quickly changed the subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hype around Osborne's rapid progress died down fast as the crowd's attention shifted to the other matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, Bethan from Peak </span><span>Two</span><span> really stood out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She steamrolled her opponent with ease and stood proudly on the platform. Her eyes were fixed on Vadim from Peak One and Jamar from Peak Two, burning with fierce determination.</span></p></div>
