        <h1>Chapter 957 Fighting Side by Side</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo let out a chilling laugh. "So, he's your grandson? No wonder you hold him in such high regard. Perfect! Today, I'll wipe you both out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll learn that two worthless fools teaming up are still just fools!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gerardo lunged forward, ready to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, your level isn't high enough to face him head-on! I'll hold him off while you look for an opening. Don't act recklessly. Remember, you need to be like a hunter, waiting for the perfect moment to strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian charged into the fray, but he was at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His injuries had left him weaker than usual, and Gerardo's strength was formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even in his compromised state, Gerardo would find it challenging to defeat him outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fought against the urge to leap in and assist his grandfather, choosing instead to heed Sebastian's advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He steadied his breath, focusing on becoming a hunter, his eyes locked on Gerardo, waiting for a moment of weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle raged on, the air crackling with energy as the forces clashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves crashed violently against the shore, and trees in the jungle fell like dominos under the strain of their fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he had to unleash his martial art aura to withstand the aftermath of their combat. He manipulated the light around him, concealing his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, deep down, he understood that Gerardo was no fool; he was aware of Osborne's position and kept a portion of his attention on Osborne even amidst the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made it difficult for Osborne to find an opportunity to strike, but it also meant Gerardo couldn't fully focus on overpowering Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't wait any longer! I have to take action!" Osborne's expression hardened with resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian wanted him to play the role of the patient hunter, but the truth was that hunting wasn't so straightforward. Osborne feared that if he didn't act soon, Sebastian might not be able to hold out much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grandfather's injuries were serious, and the longer this fight dragged on, the worse they would become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne made his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Sebastian, who only acted when he was sure of victory, Osborne was more like a predator ready to pounce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opportunities had to be seized in the heat of battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, he readied himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pulled out the </span><span>Thundergod</span><span> Gloves, this time slipping them onto his right hand instead of his left, and gripped the Goddess of Grain's scythe tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was too powerful; even with the Divine Bone energy surging through his right leg, Osborne could only inflict minor wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His other abilities wouldn't even scratch Gerardo's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the sharp edge of the scythe held the potential to inflict serious damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sebastian was once again sent reeling by Gerardo, blood spilling from his lips, Osborne seized his moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He darted in front of Sebastian, standing defiantly against Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's eyes widened in alarm. "Osborne, be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was steely. "Don't worry, Grandpa. I may not be his match, but he won't find it easy to take me down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne unleashed the Light Realm, casting a radiant glow over the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light of Redemption!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bright beams cascaded from above, enveloping Sebastian and mending his wounds, replenishing his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pallor of Sebastian's face began to fade, replaced by a healthier hue. Unfortunately, the most severe of Sebastian's injuries, those inflicted by Gerardo's divine power from a divine corpse, couldn't be healed by Osborne's magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, at least Sebastian was in better shape now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's rage flared as he glared at Osborne, his voice cold and threatening. "Damn you! If you're looking for death, I'll gladly oblige! I'm going to kill you, and Sebastian can't stop me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he launched himself toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Destruction Orbs! Disintegration Rays!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed a torrent of energy, a dazzling array of orbs and rays spiraling through the air like a swarm of furious fireflies, all aimed directly at Gerardo, threatening to engulf him entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For any ordinary Class S, facing such an onslaught would mean certain death or grievous injury. Yet, Gerardo stood unflinching, welcoming the oncoming attacks. His defenses held firm; the assaults barely rippled across his aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered in contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the best you've got? It wouldn't even tickle! Now, prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, the raw power surged from Gerardo as he hurtled toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gripped the Goddess of Grain's scythe tightly, his expression deadly serious. He showed no inclination to dodge, with his focus entirely on Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impending strike from Gerardo was monstrous, and he knew that if that blow </span><span>landed, Osborne would be severely injured, if not killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had faith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed Sebastian would protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as anticipated, Sebastian stepped in front of Osborne, blocking Gerardo's attack with a surge of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes narrowed as he whispered to himself, "Now's the moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!"</span></p></div>
