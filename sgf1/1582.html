        <h1>Chapter 1581 Victory</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald Saxton's teeth flew out as Osborne slapped him hard across the face. His vision blurred, and he saw stars. He was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald was the pride of the Saxton family, the strongest in the Aether Hawks Clan. His father, Herman Saxton, was a Deity Overlord&mdash;second only to the Deity King. He was also the real general of the Wild Flame Army. Donald had grown up with privilege, surrounded by people eager to flatter him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had ever dared to disrespect him, let alone strike him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, Osborne had knocked his teeth out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, someone Donald had always seen as nothing more than a lowly human.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rage flared in Donald's eyes, turning them bloodshot. He was furious, his entire being brimming with killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You filthy human, I swear I'll&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald started to snarl, but before he could finish, Osborne slapped him again, just as hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald's head buzzed, blood dripped from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne wasn't done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Filthy human?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think you're superior to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who gave you the nerve to act tough in front of me? What makes you superior?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your dad's a general? Big deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How does this feel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne kept slapping Donald, controlling his strength to make sure the young man felt every bit of pain without losing consciousness. He wanted Donald to feel every ounce of the humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The combined physical and mental torment pushed Donald to the edge. He wanted nothing more than to kill Osborne, but he was utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald was only at the early stage of Celestial Deity rank. For Osborne, overpowering him was effortless&mdash;like an adult toying with a toddler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was then that Murray Whitehead, who had been in a fierce battle with Guy Borden, noticed what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face twisted with rage, his eyes full of killing intent. He tried to rush over to save Donald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Guy wasn't about to let that happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both of them were early-stage Deity Overlords. Their power difference was minor, and it was almost impossible for Murray to break away from Guy to help Donald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray roared in fury, his eyes blazing. "You filthy human! How dare you lay a hand on Mater Donald! You're dead! You hear me? You're as good as dead! Not even Guy can save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guy, if you keep me from saving Donald, you're done for too! Just wait until General Saxton finds out! Your career in the Wild Flame Army will be over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Neither Osborne nor Guy seemed bothered by Murray's threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy even intensified his attacks, his expression indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne tossed the beaten Donald to the ground, a small drop of blood forming in his palm before it merged into Donald's body. Slowly, Osborne began altering Donald, transforming him into a Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald screamed in agony, his body writhing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray's face went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you doing, you bastard? What did you do to Master Donald? I order you to stop right now, or there'll be nowhere left for you to hide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "You should worry about yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't know what Osborne was doing, but he had a terrible feeling in his gut. He wanted to stop it, but Guy kept him pinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guy, you're asking for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Murray's attacks grew even more frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Until now, he had held back. This was Guy's territory, and Murray had hoped not to escalate things too far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, with Donald at risk, he no longer cared. He unleashed his full power, striking with deadly intent. If not for the divine barrier around them, the entire camp would have been destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air was filled with the sound of clashing power, each impact shaking the ground. Murray's enraged attacks began to pressure Guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Guy stayed calm, knowing Osborne would step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced at Murray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Another early-stage Deity Overlord, another leader of ten thousand. I was planning to lay low for a while, but since you've thrown yourself at me, I won't hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Taking you down will not only stir up conflict between the Borden and Saxton families, but I'll also absorb your ten-thousand-man battalion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After this, I'll control over twenty thousand soldiers in the Wild Flame Army."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his mind made up, Osborne attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray's focus was entirely on Guy. Their strengths were too evenly matched&mdash;he couldn't afford any distractions if he wanted to beat Guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never imagined that Osborne, who had just reached Celestial Deity rank, would dare attack him, let alone pose any real threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caught completely off guard, Murray didn't see Osborne's punch coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's fist, shrouded in dark energy, slammed into his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Puff!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood spurted from Murray's mouth as he was sent flying. He couldn't avoid it.</span></p></div>
