        <h1>Chapter 1658 The Deathborn Army</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's team pressed forward swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From two miles away, he could easily spot patrolling Deathborn squads, which proved to be invaluable in navigating around the city-level Deathborn nest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These patrollers were endowed with keen sensory abilities within Divine Peak Nine. Although Angelo and the others had concealed their auras, a large group like theirs couldn't be completely hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, a Deathborn patrol would have picked them up without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, thanks to Angelo's vigilance, they often spotted the Deathborn before the creatures could detect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever a patrol drew too close, Angelo struck decisively, ensuring none could send word back to their fortress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they skirted the city-level nest, Angelo felt a bit of weight lift from his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Avoiding the city-level Deathborn nest isn't a problem for me. The real challenge lies ahead&mdash;the national-level Deathborn nest. There, the Deathborn numbers exceed a million, a place known as the Deathborn Kingdom. Its exact location remains undetermined, and it harbors numerous patrols.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's worse is that if I take out a few patrols, the 'King' of Deathborn Kingdom will sense it instantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's a Deity King-level Deathborn we're talking about..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow, weighing his options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the need to ingratiate himself with the Paramount Supreme Clan's Bowman family, Angelo would never have risked venturing this deep into Divine Peak Nine, particularly not so close to Deathborn Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deity King-level Deathborn? He doubted he could face them and survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, if an army of 100 thousand Deathborn turned against him, his odds would plummet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the sake of my relationship with the Bowman family, I have to take this risk. But I won't lose sleep over the nearby city-level nest. We'll pass by it soon enough." Angelo thought, managing to relax slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his expression hardened sharply, and he turned to face the direction of the city-level Deathborn nest, his brow furrowing in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something felt off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got trouble! A Deathborn army is rapidly closing in on us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, how can this be? I neutralized every patrol that got too close! There's no way they should've discovered us, let alone sent word back. Why is there a Deathborn army on our tail?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's voice was tense, and his revelation sent a wave of concern rippling through the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? We've been compromised? The Deathborn army is after us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be happening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic set in among them as the realization hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The threat from the city-level Deathborn nest was severe enough; even if they couldn't wipe out the entire squad, they could inflict serious damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo commanded, his tone steady, "Listen up! Stay calm and prepare for battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deathborn army from the city-level nest likely hasn't mobilized in full force. We're looking at around two thousands of them. We need to strike fast&mdash;destroy them and get out before we're caught!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we get bogged down, and the entire army responds, even if I manage to take them down, I can't guarantee everyone's safety!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his orders ringing in their ears, the team quickly steeled themselves for the coming fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing the situation was critical, they dropped all pretense of concealment, unleashing their divine powers to prepare for what lay ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before the first clash erupted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two thousand Deathborns, summoned by Osborne's Spatial Clone, charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His original intent had been to draw the entire Deathborn army out of the city-level nest, but despite his provocations, it seemed the nest had only dispatched this limited force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From six miles away, Osborne watched the battle unfold, intrigued by how things were developing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two thousand Deathborns? That'll definitely give them a run for their money! Among them, there are quite a few Deity Overlords, especially at the peak and late stages. They could seriously trouble Angelo's team."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes were locked on Angelo, keenly assessing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going all out, right? If you hold back, those two thousand Deathborns could easily wreak havoc on your squad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the stakes were clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wanted to gauge the strength of the Deity King-level Angelo, preparing for the acquisition of the elusive death scent liquid that lay ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very instant, Angelo was indeed unleashing everything he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two thousand Deathborns were no pushovers; his team alone couldn't hope to dismantle them quickly. Once entangled, reinforcements would come pouring in, and the odds would turn apocalyptically against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With resolve, Angelo channeled his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying wave of mind control surged across a two-mile radius, morphing into countless blades and hammers that obliterated Deathborns left and right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter their rank&mdash;Transcendent Deity, Celestial Deity, or Deity Overlord&mdash;if they came into contact with his mind control, their bodies would explode in a gruesome display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the peak Deity Overlords found themselves effortlessly dispatched before his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight was enough to make Osborne gasp.</span></p></div>
