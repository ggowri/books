        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After discovering the Deschanel family's sanctuary, Osborne couldn't help but feel a twinge of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found the sanctuary to be quite peculiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye had reached Level Eight, and the X-ray vision he had acquired at Level Two had been enhanced numerous times, making it incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could see through layers of earth, even 30 miles deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, he realized with astonishment that his Satan's Eye was unable to penetrate the Deschanel family's sanctuary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The outer walls of the sanctuary didn't seem to be made of advanced materials; they looked like natural stone. Yet this very stone was blocking his X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems the Deschanel family's sanctuary wasn't built recently! It has an ancient feel to it, as if it has stood for many years," Osborne thought, growing increasingly curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced back toward the battlefield, confirming that everything was under control. The Blood Demon members had completely taken charge, gaining the upper hand. Deciding to investigate further, Osborne moved closer to the Deschanel family's sanctuary, even contemplating sneaking inside to uncover what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed that the Deschanel family was hiding something!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Phantom Steps, which granted him unparalleled stealth, he wasn't worried about being detected. No matter how strange or solid the sanctuary's walls were, they couldn't stop his Phantom Steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne walked in parallel spaces!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne swiftly made his way toward the sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he approached, he found that his Satan's Eye still couldn't penetrate the walls, which seemed to radiate a strange energy that blocked his vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization made him cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family possesses such a unique sanctuary! They must have a significant secret! Their strength could be beyond my expectations. Even with Phantom Steps, it's wise to tread carefully," Osborne mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of rushing inside, Osborne decided to circle the perimeter of the sanctuary, observing closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noted that there were two entrances, but both were blocked by massive stone doors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to enter normally or forcefully would undoubtedly alert those inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thorough inspection yielded no new findings, so Osborne resolved to enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see what you're up to in there!" he muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he slipped through the sanctuary's outer walls as if passing through thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside, the scene before him unfolded dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was met with a sight that left him utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sanctuary wasn't large; it had a space roughly two hundred yards across, </span><span>resembling a grand plaza. In this plaza, thousands of Deschanel family members were gathered, all facing the same direction, saluting with unwavering devotion, their foreheads pressed firmly against the stone floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer intensity of their reverence shocked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly took his breath away was the power of the Deschanel family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are over five thousand Class S warriors among the Deschanel family? And at least a hundred Class S elites! Even the children, barely in their teens, possess Class A or higher abilities?" Osborne gasped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer power of the Deschanel family was mind-blowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current Augustine family, aside from the Blood Demon members, could only muster a few hundred Class S fighters&mdash;not even reaching a thousand&mdash;and most of them had only recently broken through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast, the Deschanel family boasted an astonishing five thousand Class S members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Augustine family from Newport City was known as the first Ancient Family in Rosmandi, the Deschanel family in Hearin City&mdash;the second Ancient Family&mdash;was showing a force that far exceeded his expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are they doing?" Osborne pondered, his brows knitting together in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The families of the Deschanel weren't battling the Beast Tide outside; instead, they were all gathered here, paying homage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity piqued, he followed the direction of their salute, and his eyes widened in shock at the peculiar sight before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, standing in a neat row, were a hundred large rectangular stone structures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the entire Deschanel family was honoring these very stones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, drawing closer, "Wait a minute. These aren't just stones..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced as realization dawned on him, morphing his earlier shock into utter horror. "They're&mdash;coffins?! Made of stone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wrap his head around it. "Over ten thousand of the Deschanel family, not paying any mind to the Beast Tide surging outside, are gathered here to pay their respects to a hundred coffins? What in the world are they planning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His curiosity drove him deeper into this bizarre scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the stone coffin at the front began to tremble, subtly at first, but then shaking more vigorously, as if something within were attempting to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Deschanel family felt the disturbance, an electric thrill surging through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces lit up with excitement, a collective fervor igniting amongst them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome back, our ancestors!" the head of the Deschanel family suddenly shouted, his voice booming over the gathering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In unison, over 10 thousand family members followed suit, their voices rising in a powerful crescendo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome back, our ancestors! Welcome back, our ancestors!"</span></p></div>
