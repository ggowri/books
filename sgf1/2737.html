        <h1>Chapter 2604 The Fourth Invitation-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he just needs to wait to enter that place accessible only to those below Empyrean Sacredness, then break through to Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne suddenly felt his vision blur.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A tall, perfect figure had already appeared in his room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sensed a familiar presence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked up and saw that it was indeed Adriana. During the previous Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, Adriana had also been watching from the high platform.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana smiled at Osborne and said calmly, "Osborne, you were quite dazzling today! The entire Glorious Divine Kingdom is talking about you as the number one below Empyrean Sacredness! Feeling proud?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a wry smile at her words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, please don't tease me. What number one below Empyrean Sacredness? Compared to a warrior like you, even the number one below Empyrean Sacredness is just like an ant, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana laughed and said, "I wouldn't dare think that way! With the performance you showed in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, even advanced Empyrean Sacredness experts probably aren't your match! I definitely wouldn't dare see you as an ant..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, something about your performance today seemed off!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Adriana's expression turned a bit serious. She stared intently at Osborne and said, "Osborne, be honest with me. Do you have a grudge against the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom? Are you deliberately targeting them?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was startled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Has Adriana found out?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hesitated for a moment but didn&rsquo;t answer, instead trying to change the subject.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Adriana didn&rsquo;t let it go and continued asking, &ldquo;Before, I invited you to join the Fairy Moon Sect, but you kept refusing again and again... At the time, I thought it was because you were proud, but now that I think about it, was it because you didn&rsquo;t want to implicate the Fairy Moon Sect?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you really have a grudge against the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I remember you asked me back then, if you were to go against a Top-tier Power, could the Fairy Moon Sect protect you? Would the Fairy Moon Sect help me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At that time, I told you, the Fairy Moon Sect couldn&rsquo;t protect you and wouldn&rsquo;t help you! It would only advise you not to do that! Because it&rsquo;s no different from seeking death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's expression turned extremely serious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But at that time, you told me that in this world, there are some things that must be done! Even if it ends in shattered bones, even if you know you'll die... you still have to do it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At that time, I didn&rsquo;t understand why you asked me that, nor did I think much about it! But now, I think I understand..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have a grudge against the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom! You must take revenge on the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom... But the Fairy Moon Sect isn&rsquo;t strong enough to protect you or help you, and you didn&rsquo;t want to drag the Fairy Moon Sect into it, so you rejected me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm right, aren't I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana stared intently at Osborne, as if seeing through Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, he sighed and said, "Adriana, why do you need to ask so clearly? Whether I have a grudge against the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom has nothing to do with you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was interrupted by Adriana waving her hand before he could finish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Admitting it is enough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, I want to invite you to join the Fairy Moon Sect for the fourth time! I'm not inviting you to be my disciple, but to become the Honorary Elder of the Fairy Moon Sect! Your status will be higher than that of a regular Elder, second only to me and the two Vice Palace Masters of the Fairy Moon Sect..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, are you willing to join the Fairy Moon Sect now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was shocked when he heard this and looked at Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, why are you doing this? With my strength, I&rsquo;m not worthy at all! Besides, since you guessed that I have a grudge against the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom and know I will definitely seek revenge, why still..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled faintly and said, "Because you are worth it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, the question you asked me back then, I can now answer you again! If you truly want to oppose the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom... the Fairy Moon Sect might not be able to fully protect you, but we will definitely help you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, what's your answer?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you willing to join the Fairy Moon Sect?"</span></p></div>
