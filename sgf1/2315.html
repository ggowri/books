        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pero's expression turned steely, his eyes narrowing into slits. "You're so cocky, Tyson! Yeah, I lost to you last time, but things are different this time around. I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> beat you and earn my place in the top three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson rolled his eyes, clearly unimpressed. "Top three? You think you can take down Marreese? If you can't, what makes you think Azure Haven Academy can sweep the podium? Fat chance! I, for one, won't let that happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! If you're not </span><span>gonna</span><span> back off, then let's get this fight underway!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready to eat dirt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson didn't waste a second. He whipped out a sleek, jet-black spear over ten feet long. It practically oozed an intimidating aura of power. It was a quasi-Sacred Artifact, a weapon grade that showed he was no run-of-the-mill competitor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, every fighter in the top sixteen had their own quasi-Sacred Artifact; no one was willing to skimp on their armaments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pero let out a derisive snort and brandished his long sword. "The fight will show </span><span>whose</span><span> mightier&mdash;your spear or my sword! Let's see who's got the real chops!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this show on the road!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening crash, the fierce battle kicked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne found himself drawn to the arena, transfixed by the clash of two top-notch warriors under the Empyrean Sacredness. The intensity of their fight was truly a sight to behold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's spear blazed with flames while Pero's sword crackled with electric energy. Right from the get-go, both fighters poured out their maximum strength. Soon, the arena was engulfed in a dazzling spectacle of fire and lightning, with the two forces colliding and annihilating each other in a jaw-dropping display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like Pero's in a tight spot!" Osborne murmured under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar and Bethan exchanged confused looks. Both of them were fixated on the fight, but they couldn't tell who had the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like a dead-even match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer might </span><span>exuded</span><span> by the two sent shivers down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne smiled with a knowing look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye had already seen through the situation. Although it seemed like a stalemate on the surface, Pero was pouring every bit of his energy into the fight, while Tyson was still holding back, conserving his strength for later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless Pero had some secret weapon up his sleeve, the outcome was pretty much set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battle wore on, Osborne's prediction came true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Tyson stepped up his game, Pero found himself on the back foot, struggling to parry Tyson's fiery spear. The color drained from his face as he realized he was losing ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I concede!" Pero </span><span>finally roared,</span><span> his voice laced with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was afraid that if he kept going, he'd get injured, which would mess up his chances in future matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his pride, Pero knew this was the smartest move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Tyson sheathed his spear and shot Pero a disdainful look. "Congratulations. You've managed to force me to use 70% of my strength. Not too shabby! You might even snag a top-five spot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he cockily shifted his gaze towards the Azure Haven Academy team and locked eyes with Leroy and Marreese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are the ones I'm really after! I'll knock you out and claim the championship for Fantasia Isle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy remained impassive, her face as cold and unyielding as granite, not bothering to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese, however, let out a derisive scoff. "What a load of nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, he turned away, feigning indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up&mdash;Jamar from the Mystic Sirius Sect takes on Marreese from the Azure Haven Academy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, shock etched across Jamar's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected to square off against Marreese so soon&mdash;the reigning champion from the last city duel. Marreese's skills were the stuff of legends, far exceeding those of even Tyson and Pero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing he didn't stand a chance, Jamar gulped hard and spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was steady, but resignation seeped through. "I'm conceding this match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter exploded from the audience, reverberating throughout the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! The Mystic Sirius Sect's third-ranked contestant gives up without even throwing a punch! How pathetic!" someone jeered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others chimed in, some pointing and guffawing, "The Mystic Sirius Sect is a laughingstock! The first quitter has emerged. Who's going to be next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marreese is invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd chanted, already relishing Jamar's downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar's face flushed with humiliation, and his fists balled up tightly. Among the onlookers were numerous disciples from the Mystic Sirius Sect, who felt the sharp pang of shame and wished they could vanish into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no turning back the wheel of the matches now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up, we've got Osborne from the Mystic Sirius Sect facing off against..."</span><span> </span></p></div>
