        <h1>Chapter 506 She Watched It</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing here again?" Isa said coldly as she saw Osborne, her eyes filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just smiled, completely unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Isa too well by now. He was familiar with every inch of her skin, having left his mark on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Isa was all talk. As long as he applied a little pressure, she would quickly fall in line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying a word, Osborne walked up to Isa, wrapped an arm around her waist, and pulled her into his embrace, lowering his head to kiss her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa murmured softly and gave him a couple of half-hearted pushes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she realized she couldn't move him, she gave up and let Osborne kiss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle internally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Isa really wanted to, she could easily knock him out with a single punch. The fact that she didn't budge him meant only one thing&mdash;she didn't actually want to push him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She closed her eyes, her lashes fluttering slightly as she savored the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Osborne's hands started to wander, moving from her chest down towards more intimate areas, she finally shoved him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough. Don't get any ideas," Isa warned, her tone firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you get too turned on, don't expect me to help you out with that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at her, dumbfounded, feeling an intense wave of embarrassment wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You saw everything?!" he snapped, trying to hide his discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smirked. "What? Are you embarrassed? I just watched. Oh, wait... I also recorded it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to do with it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa gave him a wicked smile. "Why should I tell you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Delete it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Delete it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a bit of playful bickering, Osborne finally settled down on the couch with Isa in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Zoe came downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the footsteps, Osborne instinctively tried to pull away from Isa, but she tightened her grip around his neck, refusing to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, however, seemed completely at ease. When Zoe reached the bottom of the stairs and saw the two of them cuddled up together, her eyes widened in shock. Isa casually waved her over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe walked closer, staring at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you two... together?" she stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded, and Osborne, seeing Isa's calm demeanor, nodded as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's eyes lit up with a mischievous smile. "I always thought you two should be together! You're so beautiful, and you're so handsome. You're the perfect couple!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa couldn't help but laugh, clearly pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think flattery will get you out of training!" Isa said with a grin. "We're ramping it up today. You've been with me for almost two months now, and you're still only at Class B. And that was not what I was expecting. You need to be ready to break through to Class A within a month!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll work hard! I'll just grab something and get back to training."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She made a silly face at Osborne before dashing off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe's already at Class B? That fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa raised an eyebrow, waving her hand to levitate some grapes from the table to her. She handed them to Osborne, motioning for him to feed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't think much of it and took the grapes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After feeding her one, Isa continued, "Two months to reach Class B&mdash;that's hardly fast. She's not even as good as you were! But her power has potential. If you ever reach Class S, she might actually be useful to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class S? That's a bit of a stretch..." Osborne said as he popped a grape into his own mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa saw this and immediately pounced on him, kissing him to steal the grape back with her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, she looked at him triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wiped his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was becoming more playful and uninhibited, and he was enjoying it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he kept putting grapes into his mouth, making Isa steal them back. Isa pretended </span><span>to be annoyed but never missed an opportunity to take the grape from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they were playfully wrestling with each other again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Zoe peeked around the corner from the staircase, watching Osborne and Isa's playful antics. She was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really the serious Ms. Bowin?! Wow, Osborne really is something!" she whispered to herself before scampering off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A little while later, Osborne helped Isa, her face flushed, straighten her clothes. Finally, he mentioned the reason for his visit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to learn more advanced martial arts techniques," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to learn Stretch Soft Force."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded. "I can teach you. But I think your bigger issue right now is with your powers, not martial arts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with my powers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied calmly, "Just like there are advanced techniques in martial arts, there are also advanced techniques for powers. And right now, you haven't mastered any of them. Your powers are too scattered and chaotic."</span></p></div>
