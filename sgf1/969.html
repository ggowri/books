        <h1>Chapter 969 Arrived in Time</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma stood there, blood trickling from her lips, her body battered and bruised, utterly drained of energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the younger generation, she was undoubtedly a top-tier powerhouse, having reached Class AAA at just twenty-five years old and breaking into the top three hundred of the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But compared to someone like Everett, a peak Class S warrior, she was outmatched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her attacks had no effect on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a flick of his wrist, a terrifying beam of white light shot toward her, radiating an aura of death that could easily pierce through her and snuff out her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many elders of the Augustine family had met their end this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Emma felt all hope slip away. She could only stand there, awaiting her grim fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But suddenly, a tall figure appeared before her, blocking the deadly light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma froze, staring at the silhouette.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a fleeting moment, she thought she was dreaming, that in her final moments, she was conjuring up the image of the person she missed most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the next second, the figure sprang into action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was filled with rage. If he had been even a moment later, he would have arrived just in time to collect Emma's lifeless body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stood in front of her, ready to confront the oncoming light with a fierce determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Break!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a powerful kick, Osborne shattered the beam of light aimed at Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everett exclaimed, his anger giving way to delight, "It's you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hahaha! You've come just in time! Once I take you out, the Augustine family will be finished!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everett charged at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne scoffed, fearlessly rushing toward his opponent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew Everett was a top-tier Class S warrior, and he was no match for Everett, but that didn't mean Everett could take him down easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two clashed violently, and Emma watched in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It finally dawned on her that she wasn't dreaming; Osborne had truly returned and stood between her and certain death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her heart swelled with joy and relief, but as she watched the fierce battle unfold, worry crept back in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "Everett is incredibly strong!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Osborne is formidable in his own right, he is still just Class AAA. How can he hope to stand against Everett?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As expected, it wasn't long before Everett sent Osborne flying, blood spilling from his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne! Are you okay?" Emma rushed to his side, supporting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne turned to her, concern etched on his face as he took in her injuries. He nodded, determined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, I'm fine! And not just me&mdash;Grandpa is back, too! The Augustine family will be alright; we'll all be safe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just make sure to protect yourself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne's gaze hardened as he charged back toward Everett.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Sebastian had also joined the fray, his opponent being Rumen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Rumen had just finished off one of the Augustine family elders, igniting a firestorm of fury within Sebastian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rumen, you're dead meat!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian launched himself at Rumen, taking the place of the severely injured Wesson and others, engaging Rumen in a fierce battle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though he was gravely wounded and in desperate need of treatment, he couldn't afford to hold back now. With sheer willpower, he managed to push Rumen back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen's expression darkened, but he remained unfazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sebastian, what does it matter that you're back? Even in front of you, I can wipe out every last one of the Augustine family's elders!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a smug grin, Rumen stood tall. Rumen could see Sebastian was hurt and no longer at his peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, his ranking on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings was higher than Sebastian's. Why would he fear Sebastian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sebastian, you're just in time! You wouldn't want to see your precious Augustine family wiped out, would you? All you have to do is agree to hand over 70% of the rare metal mines in Rosmandi to us at the League of Divine Descent, and we'll pack up and leave. Otherwise, your whole family is done for!" Rumen threatened, a smug grin plastered on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's expression darkened, fury flashing in his eyes. He barked, his voice ringing with righteous anger, "You come to the Augustine Estate looking to kill, and then you have the audacity to threaten me? Rumen, who do you think you are? You think you can wipe us out? You're not even close!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Today, you'll be the one to pay with your life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Sebastian drew forth a scepter shimmering in black and gold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was the Godfather's Scepter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While everyone assumed the scepter was merely a symbol of authority, Sebastian alone knew its true nature&mdash;a powerful divine artifact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And its might could only be fully accessed within the confines of the Augustine Estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Divine Judgment!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a grave expression, he gripped the Godfather's Scepter tightly and raised it high above his head. His voice thundered through the air, and suddenly, the nine peaks in the Augustine Estate began to tremble violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, a horrifying force erupted from Mount Celestial Reach, surging forward and funneling into the Godfather's Scepter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The scepter glowed with a blinding radiance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next instant, a fierce bolt of lightning shot out from the scepter like a divine retribution, racing toward Rumen at an alarming speed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen's face paled as he sensed the overwhelming power of the thunderbolt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!" Rumen shouted, panic flooding his veins.</p></div>
