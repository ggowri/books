        <h1>Chapter 2052 Princess Joanna</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne dodged the whip of the elven guard once again, his expression growing colder by the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guard's attacks were becoming increasingly fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Osborne's formidable strength, any ordinary Ascension One Supernal Deity King would have been severely injured, perhaps even left for dead, under such relentless strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only fueled Osborne's anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze fixed on the nine elves, rage simmering within him, threatening to boil over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still think you can hide?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guard, now completely enraged, launched four consecutive strikes, each one failing to even graze a hair on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He evaded them all with ease, and the humiliation was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King and the youngest captain of the Fire Elf Clan's royal guard, he felt deeply shamed to be outmaneuvered by a mere human of Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of the Royal Family, this embarrassment was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fury ignited, and the wooden whip in his hand burst into flames, signaling that he was ready to unleash his full power. A strike from an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, if it landed, could easily maim even an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, let alone someone of lower rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get down!" he roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous crack, the whip transformed into a massive, fiery serpent, sweeping down toward Osborne like a divine dragon, filling the limited space of the Elf City's dimensional portal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, no matter how swift he was, found it impossible to evade the impending strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's fury reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you want me dead? Fine! Then let's settle this! Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murderous glint flashed in Osborne's eyes as he prepared to unleash his full power, ready to take down this group of elves and make his escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd just have to find another city, after all; there were plenty of other places beyond Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was about to explode into action, a commanding voice cut through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice was melodious yet authoritative, causing the Ascension Five guard to shudder and halt his attack without a moment's hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The immense, fiery whip vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, who had been ready to retaliate, also came to a stop, turning to see the source of the voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was one of the Royal Family members, a female elf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she appeared disheveled, resembling a refugee, her beauty was undeniable, with delicate skin and striking features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her brow was furrowed as she glared at the male elf who had initially reprimanded Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said coldly, "Desmond, have you had your fun yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This expedition hasn't gone well, and we've lost several elite guards. I know you're frustrated, but don't take it out on innocent people!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you keep this up, we might as well go our separate ways and </span><span>you should </span><span>stop bragging that you're my friend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished speaking, Desmond Garza's expression shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger flared in his eyes, but he quickly backtracked, trying to appease her. "Joanna, please don't be angry! I was just following </span><span>the </span><span>protocol to discipline him, not venting my frustrations!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He did break the rules of Elf City, didn't he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're members of the Elf Race's Royal Family, and he's been staring at us for too long. By the rules, he deserves ten lashes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elven princess, Joanna Edmund, scoffed disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That rule is utterly tyrannical! Our Sylvan Elf Clan has always opposed such nonsense! It was your Fire Elf Clan that insisted on implementing it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, he is obviously a newcomer to Elf City. He hasn't even set foot in the city yet and clearly knows nothing about your ridiculous regulations!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are your guards trying to kill him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond's face shifted through a spectrum of emotions, but quickly he plastered on a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joanna, please don't be angry! I see I was wrong! I shouldn't have been so arrogant and overbearing. I apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Osborne, Desmond added, "Look, my friend from the Human Community, this has all been a misunderstanding. I've been under some pressure lately, and unfortunately, you were in the line of fire. Thanks to Princess Joanna's reminder, I now realize my mistake. I genuinely apologize; I hope you can forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Handing over a VIP card, he continued, "Consider this a peace offering!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this VIP card, you'll get a ten percent discount at any establishment within the Fire Elf Clan. I truly hope you can forgive my earlier behavior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the ornate card, engraved with a flame totem, fluttered toward Osborne, he furrowed his brow, contemplating the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Desmond wasn't sincerely apologizing; his actions were merely a ploy to curry favor with Joanna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, after a moment's thought, Osborne accepted the VIP card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond visibly relaxed, turning to Joanna. "See? I've apologized sincerely, and I truly regret my actions! Please don't stay angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured to another male elf nearby. "Bernie, you say something too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernie Grantham quickly chimed in, "Princess Joanna, I believe Desmond has genuinely </span><span>learn</span><span>ed his mistakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is indeed remorseful; can't you give him another chance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna's icy demeanor softened somewhat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned, saying, "Let's hope we don't have a repeat of this. I dislike it immensely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then turned to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, Joanna didn't utter another word but gave him an apologetic look, nodding slightly before walking deeper into Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernie and Desmond hurried to catch up with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before departing, Desmond shot Osborne a cold, piercing glance filled with silent malice and barely contained rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed to say, "You lowly human, consider this your warning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without awaiting a reaction from Osborne, Desmond quickly turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his temples, sensing trouble brewing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I hoped to keep a low profile in Elf City and avoid unnecessary conflict, but that's clearly wishful thinking! I don't want to stir up trouble, yet trouble seems to find me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I discover a way to quickly enhance my powers and abilities, I'll be out of here! This is the territory of the Elf Race, and I've now made an enemy of a member of the Fire Elf Clan's Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things are likely to become a lot more difficult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed, hoping for a smoother experience moving forward, and nodded gratefully at Letitia for her earlier intervention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he stepped into Elf City.</span></p></div>
