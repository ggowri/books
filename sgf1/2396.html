        <h1>Chapter 2314 The Final Day Dawned-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela held onto Adriana's promise like a lifeline&mdash;if Osborne managed to shine in the state duel and snag a spot in the zone duel, Adriana would carve out time to watch him compete in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Angela couldn't shake the feeling that the cards were stacked against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top ten contenders were racking up points like crazy. Jared, currently sitting at tenth place, was leading the strongest disciples from the Eight Great Academies on a ruthless plundering spree. Even with a hefty three million points under his belt, he was barely clinging to his spot, constantly looking over his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne trying to close that gap?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Close to impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was currently scraping by with a measly 300 thousand points. Unless he could somehow consecutively take down ten teams on par with Jared, he wouldn't even get a whiff of the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was if Osborne didn't lose to anyone else along the way, because then his hard-earned points would be snatched right back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could he pull that off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a powerhouse team backing him up, Osborne had zero chance of toppling someone like Jared! In the entire state duel, there were only four competitors who could solo Jared's team&mdash;Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one else even came close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with a solid team, a win against Jared's crew was never a sure thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So yeah, Angela figured Osborne's chances of cracking the top ten were slim to none.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spot in the top fifty would be a respectable showing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But those two from Tempest Fortress City, Clara and Leroy, are a real surprise package! They actually teamed up and took down some serious contenders! They've both clawed their way into the top thirty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, they're sitting ducks for plundering, so hanging onto those top thirty spots will be an uphill battle! Clara used to be teammates with Osborne, so now that he's back, they'll probably join forces again... A trio like that could comfortably secure a place in the top fifty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was doing some quick mental math.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how she sliced it, the best she could realistically hope for Osborne was a solid top-fifty finish, maybe a shot at breaking into the top thirty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top twenty? Forget about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top ten? That was pie-in-the-sky thinking, pure fantasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anything beyond that? She didn't even dare to let her mind wander there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were glued to the projection screen. Osborne had just stepped through the Translocator to the second layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm and was activating the Translocator to head back to the first layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he touched down back on the first layer, the final day of the state duel dawned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, everyone had returned to the Arctic Maw Chasm's first layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final, frenzied plundering was about to kick off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood on the first layer's Translocator, breathing a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, "Finally made it back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Almost missed the cut-off and gotten the boot! Now I can finally catch my breath. Last day of the state duel&mdash;it's a free-for-all on the first layer! But I don't need to get involved in any of that plundering nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne glanced at the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha was sitting pretty at the top with over eight million points. Horace was hot on her heels in second place with over seven million, followed by Broderick and Benson with over six million apiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not bad, not bad at all! Agatha's been busy racking up those points! Looks like she shook off whatever was holding her back not long after I left, then hightailed it out of the seventh layer to start swiping points from everyone else. Eight million points, huh? Could she actually be a threat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne checked his token stash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back on the first day of the state duel, Osborne had been knee-deep in hunting for tokens on the sixth layer. He'd hauled in over a hundred, but never bothered to do an exact count.</span></p></div>
