        <h1>Chapter 2180 Chaotic Spiritual Root-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hang in there! You've already fused eighty-five percent!" Primordial urged, his voice laced with anxiety.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only watch helplessly as Osborne struggled, unable to assist in any way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, couldn't hear Primordial's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was enduring the most excruciating pain of his life&mdash;a torment that wasn't just physical but also a profound spiritual oppression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as though an unseen force was trying to stop him, warning him that the World Tree fragment wasn't meant for someone like him, a being of lesser standing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure in his soul was relentless, crushing him as if with a thousand blades.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, amidst the agony, a spark of determination ignited within Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a rare opportunity, perhaps the only one he'd ever get.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't give up, not even if it meant death.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could open his eyes right now, he'd be in for a jaw-dropping sight. On his body, the blood vessels were bulging like massive snakes coiled around. Inside those vessels, the blood was surging like a wild, roaring sea, dashing forward at breakneck speed as if it were trying to burst out of his body. Meanwhile, his skin seemed to have gone through some kind of freaky, otherworldly mutation. Rough, aged bark grew layer upon layer, wrapping him up completely. He looked like an ancient log that had weathered countless years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This seemingly ordinary log was giving off a terrifying yet incredibly pure and powerful energy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was going through agonizing pain that no ordinary person could even imagine. It was like he was stuck in a living hell. But he gritted his teeth, enduring the searing pain, and kept on holding on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time ticked by, little by little, a miracle finally happened. The bark on his skin started to peel off, bit by bit, like an old and rusty armor being shed. Gradually, his bronze-colored skin was revealed. It glistened with a crystal-clear sheen, just like a perfect piece of pearl, flawless in every aspect, and every inch of it exuded health and strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His blood vessels also gradually returned to their normal state and were no longer bulging. However, even so, anyone nearby could easily sense the wild power coursing through </span><span>him</span><span>. It was like a caged beast, ready to break free at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly but surely, the ever-present pain started to fade away, just like the ebbing tide.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Osborne was like a brilliant star, his whole body bathed in a bright green light. This light was soft yet dazzling, as if it were the purest gift from nature.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant the light faded, a bunch of mysterious ghostly shadows suddenly shot out from Osborne's body. They writhed and twisted like thick tree roots, reaching out wildly into the void. They took root deep in the emptiness, as if they'd forged some kind of mysterious connection with the entire universe. Immediately after, a huge and pure power rushed into Osborne's body like a flood breaking through a dam.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial exclaimed, "Whoa, what the hell?!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the Chaotic Spiritual Root of the World Tree? You gotta be kidding me!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He really managed to perfectly fuse with that World Tree fragment?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And he freaking got the Chaotic Spiritual Root of the World Tree? There's no way this is happening...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just a puny Human Community member. What on earth makes him worthy of the Chaotic Spiritual Root!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a real toss-up whether Primordial was stoked or green-eyed with envy when he spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne finally cracked his eyes open real slow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat up straight, and all of a sudden, he felt this insane power coursing through his body, and it almost knocked him for a loop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, this is crazy strong!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel like if I let this power loose, I could just punch a little planet right out of existence!" Osborne yelped, all giddy with excitement.</span></p></div>
