        <h1>Chapter 2642 Harvest-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at the obviously surprised Toby and asked in confusion, "Is there a problem with me knowing about Primordial Energy?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't tell me there's no Primordial Energy to exchange here? Looks like you're just bragging. You even said anything I can imagine can be exchanged here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Toby remained silent for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long while, Toby finally spoke, "I do have Primordial Energy available for exchange! But with your battle points, you can't afford it, not even close! Even just a single strand of Primordial Energy is far beyond what your battle points can cover!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was even more surprised upon hearing this. "Is Primordial Energy that precious?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course!" Toby said, "Primordial Energy can only be born in the Chaotic World! And it's incredibly rare. It's precisely because there's Primordial Energy in the Chaotic World that Primordial Creatures can come into existence!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With the explosion of the Chaotic World and the birth of the cosmos, Primordial Energy can no longer be created, and its quantity is limited. Even in the deepest parts of the universe, Primordial Energy is the most precious treasure!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you have enough Primordial Energy, it's even possible to transform an Acquired Creature into a Primordial Creature, achieving immortality. Even if the cosmos explodes, it can continue to exist."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's why Primordial Energy is extremely precious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he had enough Primordial Energy, it might even be possible to transform an Acquired Creature into a Primordial Creature, allowing it to survive even if the cosmos exploded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he had unexpectedly absorbed a strand of Primordial Energy earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was just a strand of Primordial Energy, its value is probably immeasurable!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "No wonder my strength far surpasses others at the same cultivation level! No wonder my physical toughness is even greater than Silicon-based Lifeforms at the same cultivation level..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was incredibly excited at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "How many battle points are needed to exchange for a strand of Primordial Energy? I need to set a goal for myself. Anyway, I'll come back here in the future and definitely earn more battle points. Sooner or later, I'll be able to exchange for Primordial Energy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby fell silent again for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then it said, "Primordial Energy cannot be exchanged with battle points; it requires medals! Ten billion medals can be exchanged for one strand of Primordial Energy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Medal?" Osborne wondered what a medal was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby explained, "In the first twenty-seven levels of the Celestial Spire, you can earn battle points after passing the trials! Clearing the first level gives you at least 100 battle points. Clearing the twenty-seventh level can earn you up to one trillion battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But from the twenty-eighth to the fifty-fourth level, the rewards for clearing will no longer be battle points but glory points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing the twenty-eighth level earns you at least 100 glory points! Clearing the fifty-fourth level can earn you up to one trillion glory points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And once you reach above the fifty-fourth level, the rewards change again; the reward will then be medals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing the fifty-fifth level rewards you with at least 100 medals. Clearing the eighty-first level can earn you up to one trillion medals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So if you want to exchange for Primordial Energy, you need to clear at least the seventy-second level, or even the eighty-first level, to possibly earn enough medals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing the seventy-second level, or even the eighty-first level, is the only way to earn enough medals to exchange for Primordial Energy?" Osborne repeated in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That would be very difficult.</span></p></div>
