        <h1>Chapter 2283 Accommodation-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendant flashed a smile and replied, "The top 100 all reside in the Celestial Zone. Each of them is assigned to a courtyard there according to their ranking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is clearly a form of discrimination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But in this world, the strong reign supreme. The higher your rank, the more powerful you are, and naturally, you should enjoy better living quarters. This kind of arrangement also helps to fuel the competitive spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Those with lower rankings will surely be more motivated to prove themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. First, let's get settled in," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the key in hand, Osborne made his way deep into the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex. Soon, he realized that the entire complex was built on a magnificent mountain peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zone Nine was located at the foot of the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one ascended the mountain, there came Zone Eight, Zone Seven, Zone Six, Zone Five...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each zone boasted hundreds of courtyards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The courtyard allocated to Osborne was Courtyard 8 in Zone One, situated nearly at the mountain's peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above Zone One lay an even more opulent and vast expanse of courtyards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the Celestial Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perched right at the summit of the mountain, the Celestial Zone seemed to be saturated with a denser concentration of the world's energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gazed up at the courtyards in the Celestial Zone and couldn't help but let out a little sigh. He was just eight ranks shy of making it into the top hundred and earning a place in the Celestial Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he didn't really let it bother him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The state duel strength rankings were nothing but numbers. Defeating someone with a higher ranking didn't hold much weight either. The ultimate victory would be decided in the state duel itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne located Courtyard 8 in Zone One. He inserted the key to deactivate the defensive formation and stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had he entered than several figures materialized from the neighboring courtyards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were three men and two women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like another one's joined Zone One," one of them remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Courtyard 8! Let me take a look at the strength rankings... The one ranked 108th is named Osborne Augustine. He's from the Mystic Sirius Sect in Tempest Fortress City. Wow! He's actually the city duel champion of Tempest Fortress City!" The woman's face lit up with surprise as she finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A champion from Tempest Fortress City? This could be tricky. Champions are usually full of pride. Even though Tempest Fortress City isn't that powerful, I'm afraid he won't be willing to join our team and play a supporting role for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the group frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, let's give it a shot and invite him first. We can offer a hefty sum. If he turns us down... well, we'll figure something else out. He's only ranked 108th. It won't make or break the state duel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader, Gustave Fanny, nodded. "Quintina, go and knock on the door. We'll have a chat with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing, Gustave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman called Quintina Hobson strolled over to Osborne's courtyard. She channeled her power and sent a gentle jolt through the defensive formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne swung open the courtyard door, looking at the five strangers with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I help you?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave flashed a smile and said, "Hey, Osborne! I'm Gustave Fanny. Sorry to intrude. We're here to invite you to join my team. As long as you lend me a hand in the state duel, regardless of my final ranking, I'll fork over 50 thousand Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if I make it into the top ten, the reward doubles!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've just arrived in Frost Peak City and barely settled in, and already someone's trying to recruit me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">From what Gustave's saying, he wants me to play second-fiddle and help him break into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And if he does, I'll pocket 100 thousand Sacred Crystals? That's mighty generous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sized up Gustave and quickly rummaged through his memory of the strength rankings to confirm the man's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave hailed from the Ember Phoenix Clan and was a disciple of the Luminary Plume Sect, a Second-rate Power in Frost Peak City. In the Frost Peak City duel, he'd clinched the third-place spot. Given Frost Peak City's overall might, his position on the strength rankings was higher than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave was ranked 103rd!</span></p></div>
