        <h1>Chapter 2595 Blackstar Bow！-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Seraphina slowly took out a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a bow and arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bow emitted an incredibly terrifying aura, as if it could devour one's consciousness. Just staring at it made you feel dizzy, as if you were about to fall into it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is my most proficient Supreme Sacred Artifact, Blackstar Bow. Since it is a Supreme Sacred Artifact, I usually wouldn't use it. After all, among opponents at the same cultivation level as me, none are worthy of me using it," Seraphina said proudly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked down at the Blackstar Bow in her hands, her gaze incredibly gentle, as if she were gazing at her lover. Her fingers gently caressed it. Immediately, the bow trembled slightly, its power rippling softly, as if responding to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina smiled and then looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sneered, "To seriously injure you, I&rsquo;ve decided to use the Blackstar Bow. Since you&rsquo;ve made me bring out the Blackstar Bow, you can already feel proud."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, take out your weapon and let it tremble before my Blackstar Bow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Seraphina in surprise, not expecting that Seraphina's true expertise would be in archery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a Supreme Sacred Artifact, the Blackstar Bow's energy is incredibly terrifying and powerful, and the attacks unleashed with it are absolutely formidable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne remained very calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He calmly said, "So you also use a bow. In that case, Bloodwrought Bow, come out and meet your kind."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the Bloodwrought Bow appeared in Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Bloodwrought Bow emitted a crimson, blood-like eerie glow, gently pulsating. It wasn't particularly intense, yet it seemed to merge seamlessly with the energy around Osborne, as if it were a part of his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the Bloodwrought Bow in Osborne's hand, Seraphina mocked, "Kindred?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is merely a Superior Sacred Artifact bow. How can it be called kindred to my Blackstar Bow? That's utterly ridiculous. If you were using a Legendary Sacred Artifact bow, I would respect your strength. Unfortunately, this is just a Superior Sacred Artifact. It seems I will win this battle with ease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the Blackstar Bow in Seraphina's hand unleashed even greater energy. Just as Seraphina looked down on Osborne, the Blackstar Bow also looked down on the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its terrifying energy suppressed the Bloodwrought Bow's power, making it seem like a candle in the wind, ready to be extinguished at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Bloodwrought Bow was completely suppressed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, one is a Superior Sacred Artifact, while the other is a Supreme Sacred Artifact. The gap between them is immense!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the crowd started murmuring again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man said helplessly, "He's finished! Even without considering strength, the huge gap in weapons has probably already decided the outcome of this battle. I actually thought Osborne might have a tiny chance of winning before. But now, it seems he has no chance at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman said in shock, "The gap between a Superior Sacred Artifact and a Supreme Sacred Artifact is like the difference between a warrior at advanced Empyrean Sacredness and one at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, or even Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. Such a gap is irreversible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another man suggested, "Osborne should immediately put away that broken Bloodwrought Bow, take out the Superior Sacred Artifact scythe he used to defeat Prince Matthew earlier, and engage in close combat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, Osborne might have a sliver of hope, though just a tiny bit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another woman said, "The gap between their weapons is too big. Also, there&rsquo;s definitely a significant difference in their strength. I thought this would be a thrilling championship battle, but now it seems this might end quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if he gives it his all, Osborne can at most withstand three arrows from Princess Seraphina."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd's chatter made Seraphina smile again. She glanced at Osborne with disdain and calmly said, "Let's end this boring fight quickly. I told you, among those who haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness, no one is my match, including you! Let's begin!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Seraphina's Blackstar Bow shimmered with a sharp black light, quickly transforming into an enormous bow and arrow, standing tall before her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a massive arrow glowing with black light appeared on the Blackstar Bow.</span></p></div>
