        <h1>Chapter 2276 Dispelling Doubts-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always assumed it was his own shortcoming, that he just hadn't hit upon the right approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Osborne had dedicated all that time to normal power-merging, he might have already incorporated a third power into his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he had been trapped in a dead-end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana was really something. Just by listening to his question, she'd sized up his situation. And with just a few words, she'd pointed him in a new direction. The problem wasn't fully solved, but as long as there was a way forward, Osborne was confident he'd make it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder so many people yearned for a powerful teacher. Sometimes, a teacher's casual guidance could save them from squandering years on the wrong track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne even felt an urge to become her disciple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of what might happen in the future, he thought he should learn as much as he could from Adriana first, boost his strength, and then consider taking revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, Osborne held himself back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed respectfully to Adriana. "Thanks for clearing up my confusion, Ms. Alba. I was going down the wrong road before. Without you, I'd probably have wasted a ton of time on this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana smiled, "No need to be so formal! I didn't really do anything. It's your own sharp wits that helped you see the light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit sheepish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how sharp his wits were, they were no use if he was on the wrong track. Adriana's words had really come in handy for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Adriana continued, "Actually, Isa is also fusing powers ahead of schedule. For the Fairy Moon Sect, fusing powers ahead of time at the Supernal Deity King Level isn't a big deal. The sect has ways to make sure that disciples at this level can fuse at least two powers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Adriana finished, Osborne was flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does that mean every disciple of the Fairy Moon Sect can gain Sacred Power ahead of time at the Supernal Deity King level? That's incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana gave a faint smile. "This is nothing! Fusing powers ahead of time at the Supernal Deity King Level makes it easier to do so after reaching Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But just fusing two powers ahead of time isn't anything special. Most top-notch disciples from First-rate Powers can do it. And some super geniuses can even fuse three or four powers ahead of time at the Supernal Deity King Level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes popped wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Someone could fuse three or even four powers ahead of time at the Supernal Deity King Level?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately felt the heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he'd thought he was strong enough. Osborne figured that even if there were those below Empyrean Sacredness who could beat him, they'd be as rare as hen's teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne realized he'd been shortsighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his current state, if he ran into a Quasi Empyrean Sacredness warrior who'd fused three powers ahead of time, he'd probably get overpowered and might even end up defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if he faced a Quasi Empyrean Sacredness warrior who'd fused four powers, even if he pulled out all the stops, he could only make sure he'd stay alive, but there was no way he could win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts raced through his mind, Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world was an expansive place, teeming with prodigies at every turn. It was a stark reminder that there was always someone out there better, someone a step ahead in the race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a long, steadying breath, he inclined his head respectfully towards Adriana, gratitude etched across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Alba, thanks a million for setting me straight. I won't take up any more of your time. I'm off to get back into training. You've really shown me the light, and I'm more determined than ever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana flashed a warm smile and nodded encouragingly. "Off you go! If you manage to shine in the state duel and make it to the zone one, you can count on me to be there in the stands cheering you on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep pushing forward! Isa's getting stronger at an astonishing pace. You don't want her to outdistance you too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded with a solemn nod, clearly taking her words to heart. He then offered a respectful farewell and made his way out.</span></p></div>
