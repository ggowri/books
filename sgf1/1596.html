        <h1>Chapter 1595 Make a Move</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the feeling of murderous intent dissipated, Osborne quickly raised his head, activating his Satan's Eye to pinpoint the source of that hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he saw left him utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin had lifted Athena and positioned her on a chair, parting her legs as he knelt between them, using his mouth to fervently serve her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tongue and beard sent tremors through her body as she clutched his head tightly, almost wishing she could pull him deeper into her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one glimpse was enough to leave Osborne feeling as though his eyes had been tainted, and he hastily averted his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep-seated fury flickered behind his calm facade as he muttered under his breath, "What a couple of scoundrels...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those two are definitely plotting to kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't sit back and let them make their move; I need to prepare."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne commanded his subordinates through the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scattered across the Malevolence Airship, some were off searching for old friends in secluded rooms, while others were chatting casually, completely ignoring him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if Osborne was isolated from his own crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To outsiders, this situation seemed perfectly normal; after all, the Human Community held a much lower status. Even when one of their warriors rose through the ranks to become a higher-up, people were reluctant to engage with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, those human community leaders wouldn't dare speak up, knowing that a clash with their subordinates could lead to accusations of ineffectiveness and eventual demotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was precisely why the Wild Flame Army had never had a strong Human Community presence in leadership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the individuals beneath a leader refused to follow orders&mdash;or even intentionally caused trouble&mdash;no matter how powerful the leader might be, climbing higher in the ranks would be a struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin had faced this issue in the past, but now, having married Laird's illegitimate daughter and ingratiated himself with the Borden family, along with his affair with Athena, he was free from such worries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, too, didn't have to fret about this anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single one of his subordinates, while outwardly appearing to resist him, had been transformed into loyal members of the Blood Clan. They were utterly devoted, ready to execute his orders without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they received Osborne's instructions, they moved seamlessly, ready to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Calvin finally brought Athena to a climax, leaving her thoroughly satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead&mdash;do whatever you want to that guy. I'll back you up!" she purred, casting a sultry glance at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin heaved a sigh of relief, realizing that all his hard work and compromises were finally paying off. What had driven him to cater to Athena's every whim, to set aside his pride, if not for the promise of her support and influence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, wasn't it her exalted status among the Upper Race that he had truly been after?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might not be able to marry her or tie himself to the Huntington family, but this way of earning Athena's favor still had its perks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, just watch me perform! That bastard Osborne doesn't stand a chance; I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> make him wish he was never born!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin laughed coldly before turning to leave the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Calvin emerged onto the deck with a few henchmen, spotting Osborne sitting all alone in the corner, utterly isolated, not even a servant around him. A look of scorn washed over Calvin's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exchanged a quick glance with one of his subordinates, who took the cue and strolled toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh man, I suddenly need to relieve myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have time to find a proper place&mdash;guess I'll just take care of it right here!" the man called out loudly as he approached Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mocking smile plastered across his face, he feigned urgency, clearly intending to humiliate Osborne by pretending to urinate where Osborne sat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a pathetic attempt that anyone could see through&mdash;just a mean-spirited tactic meant to gross him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes with a cold smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Calvin, so you've finally decided to make a move?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But honestly, is this really the best you can come up with? You think this little stunt will humiliate me? That you can provoke me into a response and then use Athena to cause me trouble?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How utterly laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the man approached, preparing to pull down his pants in front of Osborne, a thought crossed Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the thug fumbled to expose himself, an icy flash of blade appeared behind him, zipping toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From outward appearances, the attack was aimed straight at Osborne, but ironically, it was on a collision course with the very man trying to humiliate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Completely oblivious to the danger lurking behind him, the man had just started to pull down his pants when he felt a biting chill sweep across his lower body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, blood erupted as his member was severed clean off, falling to the ground with a sickening thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Aaaah</span><span>!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing scream pierced the air, his body going into spasms as he crashed to the deck, writhing in agony. The pain coursed through him, turning his world into a chaotic ballet of horror and disbelief.</span></p></div>
