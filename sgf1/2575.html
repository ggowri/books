        <h1>Chapter 2472 I’d Rather Lose It Than Give It to You</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Clara and Leroy voluntarily transferred their 3 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to Osborne?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are they doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was shocked, completely unexpected such a situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the effect was also very obvious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Leroy and Clara transferred their Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to Osborne, they immediately felt those malicious gazes shift away from them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All their gazes focused on Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made them feel much relieved; those malicious, greedy gazes had put too much pressure on them. If Osborne hadn't been there, they would have lost composure long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, they could finally relax.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They no longer had Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, so naturally, no one would want to target them anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at the same time, they were even more worried about Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, what puzzled them was that despite so many malicious gazes, Osborne didn&rsquo;t seem worried. His expression remained unchanged, as usual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They exchanged a glance, somewhat admiring Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's calmness and composure, the confidence he showed in the face of danger, were not something they could learn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you must be careful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara couldn't help but express her concern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "Don't worry! I already have a plan. But you all... transferring all the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to me without following your Sect elders' arrangements might bring you some trouble from them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy's expressions changed upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they quickly shook their heads. "It's fine! These Kingdom Duel Scorepoints are originally ours; they don't belong to the Sect or any Sect elders! How we handle them is none of their business!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, we are the runners-up of the zone duel! We've brought glory to our Sect. If they blame us, we might as well leave the Sect!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and found it quite reasonable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at the same time, he was a bit puzzled. He had won the championship in the zone duel and still had over 40 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. Why hadn't anyone from the Mystic Sirius Sect contacted him yet? Could it be that they didn't care at all?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was still a disciple of the Mystic Sirius Sect. A disciple winning the zone duel championship should be a huge honor, no matter what!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for some reason, the Mystic Sirius Sect's Sect Master Lenny still showed no reaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but glance around, but he didn't spot anyone from the Mystic Sirius Sect in the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Strange!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Top ten of the zone duel, please come to the stage for the award ceremony!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a voice interrupted Osborne's thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The award ceremony began.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's view, the award ceremony and the departure ceremony were the most boring parts, completely unnecessary. If there were no award ceremony, he wouldn't have to return to Crescentia and could directly use Abyssal Planet's Cosmic Translocator to teleport to other places...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had leverage over Ian, and Ian would definitely agree to let him use the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he could teleport to another place, his situation would be much safer. Finding a place to hide and avoiding these greedy crowds would be much easier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, he couldn't do that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of the award ceremony and the departure ceremony, he had to return to Crescentia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was the champion, the last to step onto the podium.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amid countless malicious and greedy gazes, he smoothly accepted his trophy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, there were also rewards...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The champion of Zone Duel was rewarded with one billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That means nothing to Osborne now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the award ceremony ended. Next was the departure ceremony, where the top ten each received an Armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They will represent Eastern Zone 3 in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel held six months later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne held the Armor with an incredibly determined expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Finally, I qualify to participate in the Glorious Divine War! The Glorious Divine War's venue is within the Augustine family's Royal Sepulcher... Six months later, I can openly enter the Royal Sepulcher to pay respects... to my mother from my previous life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne felt very excited and full of anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To gain a suitable identity to enter the Royal Sepulcher and pay respects to his mother from his previous life, he started with the Mystic Sirius Sect's Sect Tournament, then went through the Tempest Fortress City's city duel, the Zephyr State's state duel, and the Eastern Zone 3's zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he finally stood out from the zone duel, earning the title of district champion and the opportunity to enter the Royal Sepulcher to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, he only needed to wait six months to enter the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, given his current situation, whether he could survive these six months was uncertain, as countless warriors were already eyeing him for his immense wealth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those targeting him were at least advanced Empyrean Sacredness, possibly even Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection or Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection... Breaking through their pursuit and finding a place to hide wouldn't be easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne possesses spatial power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, his only option now might be to quickly spend the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, or even...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Give them away!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, he can take a risky gamble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne heard a cold snort beside him. He couldn't help but turn his head and saw Brenda, staring at him with an incredibly icy gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, so what if you won the zone duel championship? You're too flashy! Carrying so many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, you're doomed! You're just a disciple of a Second-rate Power; your Sect can't protect you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're smart, you can transfer the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to me! Behind me is Skyearth Dominion, the top-tier First-rate Power! Even if I carry a huge amount of Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, no one would dare to touch me easily!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Transfer the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to me, and at least you can stay alive! This is a good deal for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, you also need to return my Ice Scepter!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda finished speaking, her face full of arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but roll his eyes, looking at her with an expression as if she were an idiot. He said calmly, "Are you out of your mind? Got too much of a shock and went dumb? You want me to transfer all the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to you? And return the Ice Scepter to you? Heh, why don't you take a good look at yourself in the mirror?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you think you are? Even if I gave the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to a dog or lost the Ice Scepter, I wouldn't give them to an idiot like you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get lost quickly, or I might not be able to resist punching you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne couldn't be bothered with Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda, upon hearing this, was completely enraged and gritted her teeth, saying, "Fine, fine, fine! Osborne, keep being arrogant! You've given up your only chance to survive! I want to see how you'll die this time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's wait and see!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Brenda fell silent, her gaze at Osborne growing colder, filled with mockery and disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned but didn't think much of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the expedition ceremony ended, and the zone duel officially concluded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many spectators began to leave at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But more people stayed, still staring at Osborne, as if eyeing prey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The malice felt at this moment grew even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt as if those people could pounce and tear him apart at any moment!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, I need to leave quickly!"</span></p></div>
