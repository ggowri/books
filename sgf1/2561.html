        <h1>Chapter 2460 Brenda's Achievement-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's various achievements densely filled the entire sky at this moment, including Dark Mandala, the corpses of Abyssal Clan reaching Empyrean Sacredness, a large number of Bloody Ivies, Abyssal Snakes, Eaglebeak Moths' wings, and Tigerstripe Bees' stingers, with the most being Ice Beetles' corpses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was stunned by Brenda's achievements, even those who had acted alongside Brenda were left speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They only knew that Brenda had been assigned the most achievements, but they found it hard to calculate exactly how many. At this moment, when they saw it with their own eyes, they finally realized Brenda's achievements were far greater than they had imagined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, many people felt very jealous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These achievements could all be exchanged for Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. Then, they could use them to redeem treasures in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How many achievements does Brenda have?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Ian was stunned. He rubbed his eyes, thinking he had seen it wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he turned to look at Gerald and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian's eyes were filled with doubt, as if he were asking Gerald whether Brenda's achievements were obtained on Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suspected Brenda cheated and that Skyearth Dominion had prepared many achievements for her in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald gave a wry smile and quickly said, "General Ian Augustine, Brenda indeed earned these achievements through her own abilities, and she achieved them all on Abyssal Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Actually, the resources on Abyssal Planet are far more abundant than we previously assessed. Moreover, the appearance of the Magma Devourer caused most of the Native Creatures on Abyssal Planet to hunt down the contestants...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>That was why she gained the most!</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Ian's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are the resources on Abyssal Planet really that abundant? I did a patrol before, but I was only looking for the one who killed the Magma Devourer. I didn&rsquo;t notice. Unfortunately, I also didn&rsquo;t find the one who killed the Magma Devourer..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like we must seal off Abyssal Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The resources here must be developed gradually by the Glorious Divine Legion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Ian looked at Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're impressive, and your luck is great too. You obtained such a massive amount of resources. If I had known earlier that the resources on Abyssal Planet were so abundant, I wouldn't have had a zone duel with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, it's not too late for you to know now, and your achievements won't be taken back. They will all be converted into Kingdom Duel Scorepoints for you to use as you wish!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Ian finished speaking, Brenda breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda had truly been worried before that Ian might deny her achievements or even take them back after she gained so many.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Glorious Divine Legion discovered Abyssal Planet, and all the resources there originally belonged to them and the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Ian used this as a reason to take back the resources they obtained, Brenda would have no way to refuse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it seems now that Brenda was overthinking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's achievements are indeed numerous, but to the Glorious Divine Kingdom, they are nothing significant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Glorious Divine Kingdom is wealthier than she could imagine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda smiled and said, "Thank you, General Ian Augustine. Now please help me with the statistics!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Ian smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian appeared calm on the surface, but he was actually a bit jealous of Brenda. Although he hadn't done a detailed count, his rough estimate already indicated that these resources were worth at least six to seven hundred million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda could use six to seven hundred million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to exchange for a decent Legendary Sacred Artifact in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury.</span></p></div>
