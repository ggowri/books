        <h1>Chapter 1263 Deities of the Augustine family</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the grand meeting room of Augustine Bastion, Sebastian, Anastasia, Bryce, and others watched the projected images with serious expressions. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them, over a hundred high-ranking members of the Augustine family stood in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remarkably, all were deity-level warriors, having achieved this status through the enhanced energy of the Bastion and Phoenix Ascension, breaking through to become Junior Deities. Yet despite their impressive ranks, none looked pleased; concern was etched on every face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian switched off the projector and addressed the room, "You've all seen it. In just two days, over twenty superpowers across </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> have been attacked. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attackers claim to be from the Deschanel Clan, and they're </span><span>all powerful</span><span> Superior Deities. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They've crushed these powers, demanding allegiance&mdash;submit or perish! It's only a matter of time before they send a Superior Deity our way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sebastian finished, murmurs spread through the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they dare come for us, we'll take them down! Superior Deities or not, we have over a hundred Junior Deities, with more ascending every day. Even if a Superior Deity shows up, we can handle them!" someone declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! They want our allegiance? Not happening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll fight them to the end!" another added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian raised a hand to quiet the room. "Submitting is not an option. Our family is too strong to become anyone's subordinate! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've gathered you here to strategize. If there's only one Superior Deity, we could hold our own, but there are at least five from the Deschanel Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent as the gravity of his words sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of these Junior Deities had forged their Divine Bodies through Phoenix Ascension. Their Divine Bodies were at least Level Three, many were Level Four, and both Sebastian and Bryce had reached Level Five. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most impressive of all was Anastasia. With her dazzling blue Divine Flame and a Level Six Divine Body, she was a rarity even during the Age of Gods. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She might even achieve a Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body in the future. Her potential was boundless, and she could already contend with Intermediate Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the power Phoenix Ascension had endowed their Divine Bodies, the family felt confident they could face one or two Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan and emerge victorious. But five? And what if there were more?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence filled the room as these thoughts weighed heavily on everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian spoke again, "Osborne is currently in seclusion, with no clear timeline for his return. We must handle this ourselves and not rely solely on Osborne. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Clan aims to conquer </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> and beyond, and given our proximity, they won't overlook us! I suspect they'll make their move soon. Let's discuss how we plan to resist them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's gaze swept over the gathered family members, awaiting their input. The members were quick to voice their opinions:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight them to the end! Take one down, and it's worth it; take two, and we profit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should flee far away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Negotiate with them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pretend to surrender!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, however, dismissed each suggestion. Just then, Anastasia spoke up with a calm yet firm voice, "I suggest we hold our ground at the Augustine Bastion. Osborne hasn't returned, and none of us possess spatial power. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we wanted to escape, we couldn't. The Deschanel Clan has suddenly </span><span>mobilized so many Superior Deities&mdash;I fear there are even more powerful forces yet to show themselves. We're no match for them now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anastasia spoke, everyone fell silent. Though she was only in her twenties and the youngest among them, no one dared underestimate her. Her respect was not just because she was Osborne's cherished sister but also due to her remarkable talent. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Anastasia possessed a Level Six Divine Body. Even Sebastian, the former Godfather, and Bryce, a legendary genius, had only managed to attain Level Five. Anastasia's talent was unparalleled in the Augustine family, second only to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gentle expression, Sebastian encouraged her, "Anastasia, go on. Speak your mind fully, don't fear mistakes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding, Anastasia continued, "The warriors of the Deschanel Clan have endured since the Age of Gods. Their power is beyond our current capability. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our greatest advantage is the Phoenix Ascension and a hundredfold increase in celestial energy, enabling many to ascend to godhood every day. So, our only option is to hold strong at the Augustine Bastion and buy ourselves time..."</span></p></div>
