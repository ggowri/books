        <h1>Chapter 1740 Battle Against a Mid-stage Deity King</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich furrowed his brow. Earlier, he had found "Vivienne" to be frighteningly strong; her talent was astonishing. Although fury coursed through him, he had to admit that finding someone who could effortlessly defeat Alfred at the same level was no small feat in all of Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his shock, this prodigy was not the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, the real leader stood before him</span><span>, </span><span>this "Theodore".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, he scoffed, "What nonsense is this 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings'? Even the so-called 'Seven Great Deity Kings' have been nearly wiped out by the esteemed Lord Malevolence! The only one still hanging on is the God of Light, barely surviving in the West Zone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He advanced threateningly, the tension rising. "But here we are in the East Zone! You dare come here claiming to be the Seven Young Deity Kings? You're practically begging for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll send you straight to the afterlife!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for letting the Mystic Feather Clan go? Ha! Your very presence only proves their collusion with the Human Community. They deserve to die even more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with malice as he finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm</span><span> and</span><span> show</span><span>ed</span><span> no sign of fear. "Oh? So it looks like what the Bowman family says amounts to nothing but hot air! But that's fine. I never expected you to keep your promise and release the Mystic Feather Clan, anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to kill us? Let's see you try! I'm eager to find out just how strong a mid-stage Deity King really is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, determination ignited in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a mid-stage Deity King they were talking about</span><span>, </span><span>a level he had never faced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most powerful opponent he had encountered was Chandler, who was close to that tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aldrich was clearly on a different level, especially being a member of the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He likely possessed the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, making him all the more formidable than Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne felt unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this! This will be the first real appearance of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings. We need a performance that'll shock everyone if we're going to make a name for ourselves in Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Defeating Alfred isn't nearly enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You</span><span>, </span><span>this mid-stage Deity King</span><span>, </span><span>are the perfect stepping stone to elevate our reputation! Let me start by taking you down and making the Seven Young Deity Kings a household name!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured his resolve, and then an immense power erupted from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich, taken aback by Osborne's quiet determination, paused for a moment, but then a wave of derision crossed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really think you can beat me just to boost the name of your Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings? You want to step on me to gain fame in Celestara?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for death! If you were actually a Deity King, I might take you more seriously. But I can sense you're nowhere near that level! You stand no chance before me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You pathetic Human Community folks probably don't even understand the true power of a mid-stage Deity King! I'll soon show you what despair really feels like!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Aldrich launched himself into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" he roared, a punch fueled by pure divine power soaring forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of it crashed down on Osborne like a mountain</span><span> and </span><span>intense pressure b</span><span>ore</span><span> down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne stood firm, throwing his own punch in response, darkness swirling around his fist as he unleashed his full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, their attacks collide</span><span>d and</span><span> </span><span>caused</span><span> a shockwave that reverberated through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's punch shattered upon impact, and he felt a searing pain run through him as he was forced back, stumbling several feet. His divine power shield had nearly collapsed under the force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? You actually managed to block my strike? And you're not injured? Impressive. You're a bit stronger than that girl earlier!" But his condescending smile quickly returned. "Unfortunately, this level is still nowhere near enough! Prepare to be defeated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich wasted no time</span><span> and</span><span> unleash</span><span>ed</span><span> a relentless barrage of attacks on Osborne that crashed down like a tidal wave, intent on crushing him with overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others watched anxiously, ready to jump in at a moment's notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew Osborne was powerful, but his opponent was a mid-stage Deity King</span><span>, </span><span>the gap between their realms was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was still in the early stages of the Deity Overlord realm, nowhere near its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he really bridge such a vast divide?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doubt gnawed at their confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the onslaught continued, their worry deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found himself on the defensive, dodging and blocking Aldrich's furious strikes. Whenever he attempted to counter, he was swiftly pushed back, his face growing paler with each exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear he was struggling to withstand Aldrich's might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite the overwhelming pressure, Osborne's resilience left the onlookers in awe. They were more shocked by his performance than they had been by Anastasia's effortless defeat of Alfred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Aldrich was a mid-stage Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Celestara, while there were many Deity King warriors, few ever reached the </span><span>mid-stage. For every hundred Deity Kings, there might be only one who could break through to that level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each mid-stage Deity King had to be a prodigious talent in their youth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here was Osborne, holding his ground against Aldrich, not easily defeated and</span><span>, </span><span>remarkably</span><span>, </span><span>still uninjured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This reality sent gasps rippling through the crowd. It felt surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Deity Overlord against a mid-stage Deity King?" one spectator whispered in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you believe he's holding on for so long without losing?" another added, eyes wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Theodore is something else!"</span></p></div>
