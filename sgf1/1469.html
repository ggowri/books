        <h1>Chapter 1468 A Deity Overlord's Threat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian leaped to his feet, his posture radiating menace as an oppressive wave of divine power swept over the auction hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A palpable tension filled the air, and the crowd fell into stunned silence, fear creeping into everyone's hearts&mdash;even Tiana felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whereas Osborne, targeted by Fabian, now faced an even more formidable pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there stood Osborne, seemingly unaffected by the weight of Fabian's presence. His face remained calm, with not a hint of fear or panic. Instead, a smirk appeared on his face, one that carried a distinct air of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation left onlookers dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian paused, taken aback. He had expected his threat to send Osborne scrambling for mercy, begging for forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, undeterred, even daring to taunt him with a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's voice dripped with disdain as he snapped, "You're not scared of death? You really think I won't turn you into a smear on the floor with a single swipe? You can't possibly withstand my power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "Maybe you're right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I have a strong hunch that you won't lay a finger on me&mdash;at least not here, not now. Care to know why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's curiosity piqued, and the rest of the crowd looked on with intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What made Osborne so confident? After all, everyone knew that Fabian had a notoriously short fuse; anyone who crossed him could expect swift retribution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued with serene confidence, "Because I understand that every Deity Overlord warrior, regardless of their race, can't be a fool or a lunatic. If you think he's a fool or mad, then either you're the fool, or it's just a ruse on his part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Deity Overlord like you can't be either&mdash;so you're not foolish. You put on a mean face and act unreasonably, but we both know you only lash out at those who can't afford to take the hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, you wouldn't have made it this far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not afraid of you because I know you wouldn't dare provoke the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan back it up, right? So, you're not stupid enough to make a scene here! Even if you wanted to kill me, you'd wait until I'm out of the slave market first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wouldn't you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, the room fell quiet. Fabian's expression soured, the color draining from his face as he felt an unsettling exposure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of realization ignited among the spectators; now they understood Osborne's leverage. He firmly believed that Fabian wouldn't risk taking action in the slave market, which gave him the guts to engage in a bidding war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite this newfound clarity, many still believed his defiance was reckless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Fabian might hold back here, but once Osborne left, that wouldn't save him from the monstrous wrath waiting outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could save him then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian quickly came to that conclusion himself, his lips twisting into a cold smirk. "You think you're clever, don't you? Well, let me tell you something&mdash;you're dead wrong! You might think you've outsmarted me now, but you're still on my bad side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mark my words: the moment you step out those doors, it'll be lights out for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Better start planning your funeral!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that ominous threat hanging in the air, Fabian reined in his divine power and took his seat once more, tension fading as he shifted gears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I can't intimidate you, let's make it a fair contest. Even when it comes to cash, I, a Deity Overlord and head of a significant power, won't be bested by you! So I'll raise the bid to 31 million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his paddle again, determination etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana exhaled in relief upon seeing Fabian regain his composure and shift back into the auction mindset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana cast a long, searching glance at Osborne but chose silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, Osborne's bravado seemed reckless; standing firm against a Deity Overlord warrior might look bold, but underneath it all, it bordered on foolishness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless he had some secret card up his sleeve and wasn't afraid of the consequences, he was playing a dangerous game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head, a thought occurring to her. "I just hope he spends all the Essence Crystals in that Dimensional Bag before he leaves, or they might end up in Fabian's hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forty million!" Osborne declared, raising his bid again, his tone still casual as if he were tossing out a mere four thousand instead of 40 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd stirred in excitement, their eyes lighting up with speculation. "How many Essence Crystals does this guy actually have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were practically salivating, itching to leap at him, but this was the slave market&mdash;a place where even a Deity Overlord like Fabian treaded carefully. They could only glower at Osborne from a distance, their frustration simmering just beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian, too, was seething.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had his sights set on those three Celestial Deity-level female slaves and was willing to pay a hefty price. If not for Osborne's meddling, he could have snagged them for a mere 21 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By tonight, he would've had his fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Osborne in the mix, the bidding price had shot up to 40 million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Just wait until you're out of here. I swear I'll make you pay!" Fabian thought, gritting his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his paddle again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see just how deep your pockets are. I'll raise it to forty-one 41 million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shot him a cold smile. "Oh, you'll see alright! Fifty million!"</span></p></div>
