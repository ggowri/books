        <h1>Chapter 2208 Merge or Not</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's concerns were far from unfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Ophelia's experience loomed large in his mind. The thought of merging with the God of Night's memories raised the terrifying possibility of a second consciousness emerging within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if the God of Night's presence was so overpowering that it sealed away Osborne's own awareness, just like the God of Time had done to Ophelia?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that scenario, he would become merely a vessel for the God of Night, trapped in the shadows of his own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fear had driven Osborne to avoid the issue of integrating those memories, even when Isa assured him that doing so would enhance his powers. The prospect hadn't tempted him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as Anita brought it up, Isa, Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and the others turned their eyes on Osborne, waiting for him to make a choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you all want me to merge with the God of Night's memories?" he asked, his voice steady but laced with uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa parted her lips, as if on the verge of speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the end, she clamped them shut, biting down on her lip, </span><span>and muttered</span><span>, "I respect your decision. No matter what you pick, you're still you&mdash;the man I have unwavering faith in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa jumped in right away. "Right on! What Isa said, that's what we're all thinking! Whether you absorb the God of Night's memories or not, you're still you, plain and simple&mdash;Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma and Austin nodded in unison, their faces brimming with support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anita wavered, words hovering on the tip of her tongue, yet she chose to stay silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Isa and the others, it didn't make a hill of beans whether Osborne integrated the God of Night's memories. They knew him as Osborne, and their bond was so solid that it didn't hang on his past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Anita, it was a whole different ballgame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he decided not to merge those memories, their relationship would be stuck in the senior-junior rut, and that thought was like a sharp sting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you worried about what might happen if you merge those memories?" Isa asked gently, breaking the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, he nodded, voicing his concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he did, the others exchanged knowing smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa reassured him, "Honestly, you don't need to stress about it too much! What happened with Ophelia was a freak accident! It's not something that happens every day. Just look at me&mdash;I've merged my past life's memories, and I'm still the same person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those memories just gave me more experience; I'm still your familiar Clarissa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you weren't the God of Night's reincarnation, I'd still choose you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma and Austin chimed in with the same sentiment, their expressions radiating steadfast support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said, her voice full of encouragement, "Osborne, you've got to have faith in yourself! Your current power outshines what you had in your past life by a long shot. Even if those memories gave rise to a separate consciousness, it'd be you who'd put it in check, not the other way around. Am I right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're fretting about ending up like Ophelia, you can let those worries go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia's case was more like an affliction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She didn't develop a second consciousness because of her past memories. It was a mental health problem, something along the lines of schizophrenia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell quiet, ruminating on their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their pep-talk kindled a glimmer of hope within him, yet the big question still hung heavy in the air&mdash;Should he truly merge with the God of Night's memories?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he scanned the faces around him. "Can anyone tell me what the God of Night was really like? What kind of guy was he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his query, the group exchanged looks, each trying to figure out the best way to reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the girls launched into sharing their memories, their voices brimming with exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night had such an untainted spirit!" one of them exclaimed with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was extremely kind-hearted! When we were on the verge of starving, he took us under his wing and helped us tap into our latent potential. He oversaw our training," another girl chimed in, her words flowing rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was so gentle! He never raised his voice, not even when we made blunders. He always approached us with a warm demeanor, being mindful of our feelings," a third girl added, her eyes twinkling with fondness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was so humble and approachable! We were his attendants and guards, but he </span><span>never treated us like mere servants. To him, we were like friends and family," one girl said, her tone laced with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He had no interest in women..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was totally focused on training!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, a vivid portrait started to take shape in Osborne's mind&mdash;a paragon of a man, a devout ascetic whose entire life revolved around self-cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the girls' animated faces as they recounted their experiences with the God of Night stirred a bittersweet pang in Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">These are my women!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They are practically beaming with admiration and affection as they talk about the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn that guy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But he's me, after all, so maybe it's not that bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne said, "Alright! I think I've got a pretty good idea of who he was. I've made up my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll merge with the God of Night's memories!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, the thousands of years of memories held within the God of Night were a treasure trove of knowledge. Merging with them could be immensely beneficial for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there was no risk of losing himself in the process, he had no reason to refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finished speaking, the girls stared at him with eager anticipation in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had formed a close bond in this lifetime, but their fates were also intertwined with his from a past existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could retrieve those lost memories, it would hold even greater significance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa suddenly spoke up, her voice grave, "Let's make one thing clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you have to give us your word! Even if you integrate those past-life memories, you can't go back to being the person you were before! You were such a frigid individual back then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you even think about reverting, we won't spare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast a look at Isa, taking in her breathtaking figure and enchanting face. Then his gaze swept over Clarissa, Emma, and Austin, each of them a vision of beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then proclaimed fervently, "Don't fret! I can't promise everything, but I swear I won't turn into that guy again! If I even detect the slightest inclination, I'll seal away all those past memories myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who in their right mind would want to be swayed by that and become frigid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those kinds of memories? I don't need '</span><span>em</span><span>! I'm never </span><span>gonna</span><span> ditch you girls, no way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne talked, the girls' cheeks turned a deep shade of red, and they playfully glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, let's kick things off!" Isa said, her voice perking up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, her body started to emit a soft, radiant light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From within her, a dazzling sphere slowly emerged, glimmering with a mysterious grayish glow that oozed an air of enigma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa gently held the orb in her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, your past-life memories are stored inside this Orb of Reincarnation! Usually, when one goes through the cycle of reincarnation, their memories get fragmented. But thanks to this orb, yours have been safeguarded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As the reincarnated one, only you can assimilate the memories held within the Orb of Reincarnation!"</span></p></div>
