        <h1>Chapter 2634 The Eighteenth Floor-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After one person was eliminated, they ultimately only received the minimum reward. Seraphina looked very annoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're all useless!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the people around her, Seraphina felt very dissatisfied, thinking, "If these people were a bit stronger and provided me with more help, how could we possibly struggle to pass the challenge?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she didn't dare to say such things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, for the upcoming trials on the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth floors, she still needed their help. Even if they couldn't help her defeat enemies, they could provide her with extra protection, allowing her to focus entirely on offense without worrying about defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without these people, it would be hard for her to clear the levels alone. If she were surrounded and attacked, she might be defeated and eliminated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she failed to obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket on the eighteenth floor, her father wouldn't spare her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Seraphina not only didn't dare to scold them, but she also had to comfort them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, thank you for your hard work!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina smiled and said, "Through everyone's joint efforts, we finally passed the trial on the fifteenth floor. Although we only got the minimum reward, each of us has one million battle points. That's already quite a lot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, on the upcoming sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth floors, the top rewards will increase tenfold again. If we can still clear them, we can earn at least ten million battle points, enough to exchange for a high-quality Legendary Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Seraphina finished speaking, everyone immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thanks to Princess Seraphina. Without her leading us, we wouldn't have been able to pass the fifteenth floor."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right. Luckily, Princess Seraphina and the other princes and princesses are here. We would have struggled to even fend off these warriors' projections, let alone defeat them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it weren't for you, we would have been eliminated long ago!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was talking loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina smiled and said, "Alright. Now is not the time for us to celebrate. Next, we still have the final three challenges. As long as we pass them, the royal family will definitely fulfill their promise of generous rewards for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, it all depends on everyone's performance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying some encouraging words, Seraphina led everyone into the sixteenth level. They spread out to search for the trial area of the sixteenth level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina, Emiliano, and Matthew gathered together at this moment, searching in the same direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seraphina, based on the previous patterns, the trial on the sixteenth level is likely to feature projections of warriors who have reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness. And there will be at least ten of them..." Emiliano said with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina nodded and responded, "That might be the case. But it's fine, the sixteenth level won't stop us. It's just ten warriors at advanced Empyrean Sacredness. The six of us already have the strength to defeat them. As long as those useless ones can protect us, it won't be hard to pass the sixteenth level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The tougher challenges are on the seventeenth and eighteenth levels. If nothing unexpected happens, the seventeenth level will have fifty warriors at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, and the eighteenth level will definitely have a hundred."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Seraphina's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If a hundred warriors besiege us, we won't be able to hold out for long. So, those useless ones must help hold them off. Even if they all end up eliminated, as long as they buy us enough time, we will likely pass the trial of the eighteenth level..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, Osborne, Clara, and Leroy aren't in our team. Their strength is formidable, far beyond those useless ones. If they were here, things would be much easier for us."</span></p></div>
