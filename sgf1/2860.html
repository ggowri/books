        <h1>Chapter 2705 Alfreda Died Again</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is the seventeenth one!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled broadly, instructing Drum to control the opponent just defeated by Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In nearly three days, this was already the seventeenth person he had controlled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Including Weston, there are a total of eighteen people parasitized by the Soulbane Parasite and then controlled by me! They are all warriors of the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, with twelve being Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, six Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, and one Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Including me, Adriana, May, and Brittany, we have twenty-two Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors on our side! As for Frederick's side, there are thirty-two left!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation will soon be reversed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, based on Frederick's search speed, it will probably take him another two days to find the secret base of the Fairy Moon Sect! During this time, I can take down ten more targets and control them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, the number of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors on our side will exceed thirty! While Frederick's side will have only a little over twenty!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The situation will completely turn around!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Frederick, you would never imagine that those who seem loyal to you have already been under my control, right? When the real battle begins, I'll give you a big surprise!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying this, Osborne prepared to continue his actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kendra, where's the next prey?" Osborne asked Kendra.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kendra looked at Osborne, her eyes filled with admiration and affection. Over the past three days, she had witnessed Osborne take down nearly twenty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors were the top elites on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they were no match for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her admiration in her eyes was unmistakable, but unfortunately, Osborne pretended not to notice, leaving her a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly pointed in a direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne avoided Kendra's intense gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, he knew her thoughts, but he didn't dare to respond and could only pretend not to see. Luckily, Kendra didn't make it obvious, or he really wouldn't know how to face it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne controlled the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and, under Kendra's guidance, approached the next prey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For three days, they had repeated this operation nearly twenty times without a single failure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne believed there would be no surprises this time either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, he received Isa's distress message.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Naomi actually appeared in Elf City?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! Isa and Clarissa are no match for Naomi!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face darkened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't hesitate at all, immediately abandoning his previous hunting plan, waved his hand to tear open the space, and dove into the space rift.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne appeared in deep space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he began constructing the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To get to Elf City from here, using the Cosmic Translocator is the fastest way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, inside Elf City, Naomi was extremely excited. Sensing that there seemed to be a treasure within Alfreda rapidly enhancing her power, she could no longer hold back and punched Alfreda's chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her eyes, no matter what the treasure was, it should belong to her!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her fist struck Alfreda hard, the force instantly piercing through Alfreda's chest, leaving a massive hole.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda, who was merging with the Elven Mother Tree, was completely unprepared for such an attack. She was severely injured in an instant, coughing up blood wildly. The surging power within her also became chaotic at that moment, rampaging through her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's face turned pale, and she spat out another mouthful of blood. She finally opened her eyes, filled with panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa and Clarissa were both seriously injured, helplessly watching, unable to intervene.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda! Let go of my daughter!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah was uninjured, but his strength was too weak. He rushed forward, shouting loudly as he attacked Naomi.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi merely let out a cold snort, and Uriah spat blood as he was sent flying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Trash, how dare you lay a hand on me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi looked full of disdain. Seeing the blood hole in Alfreda's chest and finding no treasure, she frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Strange? What on earth is this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi's hand directly reached into the hole in Alfreda's chest; she intended to personally search for the treasure inside her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda immediately let out a painful scream. Her body trembled violently as the power within her surged wildly, wreaking havoc on her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda spat out another mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the power within her suddenly went out of control.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Alfreda's parents, brother, as well as Isa and Clarissa, all felt the uncontrollable power within her. They stared at her in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa bit her lip, mustered a trace of strength, and angrily charged at Naomi.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You truly are a foolish one!" Naomi said disdainfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa couldn't stop Naomi even when uninjured. Now severely wounded, Naomi simply waved her hand, using Sacred Power to send her flying again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You&rsquo;re all so anxious, which means there must be a treasure inside her! Then I&rsquo;ll have to search thoroughly. Even if I have to dismember her body, I&rsquo;ll find that treasure..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi let out a cold laugh as her hand continued to dig into the bloody hole in Alfreda's chest, crudely searching inside her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alfreda's power comes from the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Elven Mother Tree has merged with her, making it impossible for Naomi to find the so-called treasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense pain made Alfreda's body tremble. The power within her grew even more chaotic, and with such a backlash, her body was already damaged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, her fusion with the Elven Mother Tree was now having issues!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Elven Mother Tree was rapidly withering. If the Elven Mother Tree fused with Alfreda withered, it would also cause Alfreda's body to deteriorate quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's life was fading fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let go of my daughter!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda, you must be okay!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Alfreda's parents and brother rushed forward desperately, trying to stop Naomi. But they couldn't even get close to her. They were blasted away by Naomi's Sacred Power, coughing up blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Strange, what's going on?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why is there nothing at all?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi searched inside Alfreda for a long time but found nothing unusual. She immediately frowned and couldn't help feeling a bit annoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said coldly, "Alfreda, what secret are you hiding inside your body? Spit it out and hand it over now! Otherwise, I'll crush you to death right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood crazily gushed from the corners of Alfreda's mouth. Her consciousness had long become blurry, making it impossible for her to answer the question.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this completely enraged Naomi.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda, if you want to die, I'll grant your wish! Whatever treasure is in your body, once you're dead, you won't be able to use it, and it will be mine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Naomi's power erupted inside Alfreda's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's body suddenly exploded into a mess of flesh and blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda died again!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne stepped out of the void. Seeing Alfreda's body explode, his eyes widened, filled with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Naomi, you're fucking asking for it!"</span></p></div>
