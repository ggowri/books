        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It is an Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt incredibly excited. He originally planned to exchange battle points with Toby for an Imperial Artifact. Even if he couldn't use it for now, he could lend it to Adriana to better deal with Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he doesn't need to exchange it now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Violet-blooded Bronze Spear, the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, is a powerful Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt very excited and quickly put away the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued to ask, "There are nine Skyfall Caskets in total, so are there nine keys to the Skyfall Caskets hidden in this Celestial Spire? Have the other keys to the Skyfall Caskets also lost their power as Imperial Artifacts like the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby heard this and shook his head lightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately felt very disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, what Toby said next made Osborne excited again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby calmly said, "The keys to the other Skyfall Caskets are even more powerful than the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear. They were once Sovereign Artifacts, but all of them have been damaged to some extent. Except for the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket, which is only comparable to an Imperial Artifact, the power of the keys to the other Skyfall Caskets far surpasses that of Imperial Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even the key to the First Skyfall Casket is almost a complete Sovereign Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened, and his breathing became extremely rapid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Is the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket also an Imperial Artifact? Do the keys to the other Skyfall Caskets surpass the power of Imperial Artifacts?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How is that possible?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Also, is the key to the First Skyfall Casket an almost complete Sovereign Artifact?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is a Sovereign Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in the very center of the universe, only a very few Sovereign Artifacts are held by those Masters, possessing earth-shattering power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, within the Celestial Spire, a nearly complete Sovereign Artifact is hidden."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's breathing quickened. According to the pattern, the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket is on the twenty-seventh floor. They just need to clear the twenty-seventh floor to obtain it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The key to the Sixth Skyfall Casket is on the thirty-sixth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The key to the First Skyfall Casket is on the eighty-first floor of the Celestial Spire. As long as they can clear the eighty-first floor, they will obtain the key to the First Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's breathing became even more rapid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he keeps clearing the levels, wouldn't his gains be...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne quickly shook his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew it was impossible. They had only reached the eighteenth floor, and he had to face a hundred warriors' projections at advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this rate of difficulty increase, Osborne wasn't even confident he could clear up to the twenty-seventh floor and obtain the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearing all the way up is too hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or rather, it's simply impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This isn't easy for anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought he could at most just covet the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket on the twenty-seventh floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but ask, "Can I ask in advance what the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket is?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby responded calmly, "If others asked me, I certainly wouldn't tell them. Since you've already obtained the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, and you have a chance to get the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket next, of course, I can answer you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket is a bow..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It is the Apocalypse Bow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Apocalypse Bow was once the top-tier Sovereign Artifact, known as the number one bow in the cosmos. It had destroyed countless star clusters and killed innumerable warriors. Even warriors who reached Sovereign Empyrean Sacredness were slain by it. Unfortunately, it was also damaged. Now, most of its power is sealed, leaving only the strength of an Imperial Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Toby finished speaking, Osborne widened his eyes again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Apocalypse Bow?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The number one bow in the cosmos?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did it really destroy countless star clusters?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are star clusters?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's a celestial unit larger than a galaxy. Dozens of Racial Convergence Planets form a galaxy, and hundreds of galaxies make up a star cluster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did the Apocalypse Bow really destroy countless star clusters?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne felt his heart pounding wildly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must get the Apocalypse Bow!"</span></p></div>
