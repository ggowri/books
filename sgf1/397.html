        <h1>Chapter 397 Mission</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wade, I agree with your plan," Alexander said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alexander had already been more ambitious motivated by Wade's words. Even though Alexander knew that there would be some dangers and even possible sacrifices, he was no longer timid and fearful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Alexander made it, all the sacrifices would be worth it to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade smiled and nodded. "I will promise them. We'll just send a few masters to assist the Aberrants in making their move. As long as you and I don't attack, it will be hard for the Draco Group to find out who they are.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll let Victor do it, and he's a Class A martial master. If he does it himself, it'll be enough for us to explain to the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if the Aberrants fail in the end, our people will definitely kill themselves by taking the poison right away, and it will never be traced back to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if they succeed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade sneered, "The myth of the Draco Group being undefeated will be shattered. At that time, the Draco Group will no longer dominate the ancient families. The Aberrants will surely take this opportunity to return to Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There will be turmoil in Rosmandi!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more turbulent it gets in Rosmandi, the better our chances. Heroes emerge in troubled times, and you're the next hero!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander breathed more quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "The Maritime Auction was held by the Draco Group in cooperation with the Augustine family this time. I heard that it was proposed by Osborne, the heir of the Augustine family. Well, that asshole absorbed more than seventy percent of the power of the Blessing of Thunder that belongs to me, so I have to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Aberrants' plan works, we'll strike Osborne hard, and the Augustine family will be completely screwed. When that happens, I hope Osborne will watch helplessly as I marry Clarissa on my wedding day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed out loud, but he suddenly felt the power around him get a little unstable, so he hurriedly controlled his emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wade, I'll leave the plan to you, and I'll go on to stabilize my state. I will stabilize my state in half a month at the most, and I will fully absorb the power of the Blessing of Thunder and reach my optimal state."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade nodded. "It's nice that you know these things. You're the hope of the Paltrow family, so you just need to get your power up as fast as you can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, a burly man walked in, who was the third elder of the Paltrow family, Victor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor was a Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a Class A martial master before Brad, and he was more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade was the strongest man in the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second was Alexander, who just broke through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the only two Class A Power Masters in the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, there were the three Class A martial masters, namely the leader, Robert, the third elder, Victor, and the fifth elder, Brad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Brad had already died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would cooperate with the Aberrants to attack the Maritime Auction of the Draco Group this time, but neither Wade nor Alexander could fight because they would be recognized easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert was the leader and Alexander's father, so he also couldn't interfere with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Victor would be the only one to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Victor, I have a mission for you to lead the team to fulfill, and it is very dangerous. But if you succeed, you will bring great benefits to the Paltrow family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor sneered, "Dangerous? I'm not afraid of any danger, and as long as I can bring benefits to the Paltrow family, I'm not afraid of anything even more dangerous. The worst thing is nothing more than a death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very nice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade smiled with satisfaction, "Come here. I will tell you the plan in detail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, at the Walker Estate, the leader, Shawn, couldn't help but frown tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn also got a secret message from the Aberrants, requesting the Walker family to send masters to secretly help the Aberrants in their attack on the Maritime Auction of the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Walker family was not as ambitious as the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason why they colluded with the Aberrants was because they were worried that if they did not agree with the Aberrants, they would be revenged by the Aberrants in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now the Aberrants were asking them to send their masters to attack the Draco Group, so Shawn was in a difficult position at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even if Shawn was in a difficult situation, he had to do something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the Draco Group that easy to deal with? The Aberrants are easily going to fail this time, and there aren't many skilled masters in the Walker family, so we can't die here for nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking it over, Shawn made his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't let the Class A masters of the family participate in it, and he just picked a few Class A- masters for the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened to the Walker family continued amongst the Luther family and several other ancient families in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fishing net woven by the Aberrants was rapidly being finished, and their target was none other than the Maritime Auction, which was organized by the Draco Group in collaboration with the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne was in his room studying the broken Bronze Mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bronze Mirror's energy fluctuation was definitely at level three of the ancient magic weapon, but Osborne couldn't use it because of the strange energy layer on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Osborne anxious, and he hoped to eliminate the energy layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he still didn't make it after studying it for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I really have to ask Isa again? I just said strong people never ask for help, but I'm going to ask her for help again. She won't laugh at me, will she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was reluctant to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept checking the Bronze Mirror and even turned on the Satan's Eye. Feeling the energy on it, he suddenly couldn't help but be stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, why do I find this energy strange and familiar? It seems to belong not to the Bronze Mirror but to the Paltrow family."</span></p></div>
