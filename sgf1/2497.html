        <h1>Chapter 2399 Marrow Crystal</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who will be the first unlucky one?" Primordial was already pondering who would become the first victim killed by the enraged Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and said, "The eastern side of Abyssal Planet only has this volcanic region, which is harsh and dangerous. I remember only those with hopes of winning the championship chose to come here, around twenty or thirty people. They are all quite strong and have survival methods, so maybe they won't die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that so?" Primordial sneered, "We'll see."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quietly followed behind the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t dare to get too close. Although the Magma Devourer wasn&rsquo;t very intelligent, its strength was considerable, and its sensitivity to energy was extremely sharp. If discovered and hunted by the Magma Devourer, he would be in big trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said this Magma Devourer was equivalent to being at advanced Empyrean Sacredness. However, even someone at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection or Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection would find it hard to deal with.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to fight the Magma Devourer because he simply couldn&rsquo;t beat it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Primordial said, "The Magma Devourer's Marrow Crystal is a great treasure. If you can get it, your body will surely break through to the advanced Sacredness Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marrow Crystal?" Osborne was quite surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial replied, "Yes. Every Magma Devourer has a Marrow Crystal inside. The Marrow Crystal is a rare treasure, containing most of the Magma Devourer's power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After absorbing it, your body will become stronger. The elemental essence of your fire power will also be enhanced. Additionally, if you feed the Magma Devourer's remains to the Warfare Ancient Tree, the Warfare Ancient Tree will gain a significant boost, and your </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow can easily break through to become a mid-grade Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, it can enhance the power of fire, greatly increasing its strength. In short, the Magma Devourer is full of treasures. Do you want to try killing it? Its value far surpasses those Beast Soul Flowers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instantly became very excited, thinking, "It's full of treasures."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, Osborne smiled bitterly and said, "So what? It's at advanced Empyrean Sacredness. You just said that even a top warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection or Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection would struggle to kill it. How could I possibly do it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smiled and said, "Others may not be able to, but you might."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Primordial in surprise. "How can I do it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial confidently and smugly said, "With my guidance, you might be able to kill it. After all, its greatest strength is its defense. Even a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection or Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection might not break through its defense. Even if they manage to, its vitality is incredibly strong, and it can continue to devour magma to restore its life force. So, killing it is certainly not easy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you're different. Don't forget you have the Warfare Scythe. The Warfare Scythe is fused with the </span><span>Necrosnake's</span><span> fangs. No Sacred Artifact is sharper than it. You can use the Warfare Scythe to break through defenses that even a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection or Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection can't overcome."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you can break through the Magma Devourer's defense. Of course, just breaking its defense is useless. With your strength, even if you manage to break its defense, killing it would still be difficult. If you want to kill it, you must target its weakness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became excited, thinking, "The Warfare Scythe can actually break through the Magma Devourer's defense? After breaking its defense, I just need to attack its weakness to have a chance to kill it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is its weakness?" he asked curiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing Osborne was tempted, Primordial smiled and said, "Its weakness is its silicone-based ganglia. There are countless silicone-based ganglia in its body, but nine of them are the most crucial. If you destroy these nine silicone-based ganglia, you can render it immobile and unable to use its power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ordinary people can hardly break through its defense, let alone locate its silicone-based ganglia, especially the nine crucial ones."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But we're different. If we work together, we definitely have a chance to kill it. First, you have the Warfare Scythe, which can break its defense. Second, you have Satan's Eye, which should be able to see the locations of all the silicone-based ganglia in its body."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I know the locations of its nine most critical silicone-based ganglia. So, as long as we work together, we're its nemesis."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> words, Osborne became even more excited. "Are you really confident?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course," Primordial said confidently. "But don't rush. Now isn't the right time to act. Although you can break its defense, it's currently at its peak. Even a casual attack from it could kill you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, this is a volcanic area. Even if it's injured, it can devour magma and recover quickly. We need to wait. We have to wait until it leaves this volcanic area, so it can't use magma to heal. Once the zone </span><span>duel</span><span> referees show up and injure it or at least drain its strength, that's when we take action."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, completely convinced by Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Magma Devourer is full of treasures. It not only helps enhance my strength but also boosts the Warfare Ancient Tree and </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow. If I can successfully hunt the Magma Devourer, my power will rise again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright." Osborne's eyes were filled with excitement. He followed behind the Magma Devourer while discussing the action details with Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Magma Devourer had already reached the outskirts of the volcanic area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another sharp and piercing roar echoed through the heavens and earth. Wherever the giant Magma Devourer passed, all the volcanoes erupted wildly, as if the end of the world had arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, on the outskirts of the volcanic area, contenders like Valentino, Brenda, Dustin, and Mckinley, who were likely to win the championship, were each employing their methods to search for the Dark Mandala, also known as the Beast Soul Flower, deep within the volcano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Valentino rushed out from a volcano, his eyes filled with joy. "I got the fifth Dark Mandala."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Today is only the second day. Starry Eye is so useful. At this rate, in ten days, I can collect at least forty to fifty Dark Mandalas. Maybe, when I reach the depths of the volcanic area, I can find even more Dark Mandalas. Perhaps, I can gather a hundred."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One hundred Dark Mandalas can be exchanged for a billion Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. The championship is definitely mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino smiled confidently, as if he could already see himself winning the zone duel and becoming the strongest under Empyrean Sacredness in Eastern Zone 3.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda, how are you going to compete with me?" After saying this, Valentino prepared to continue searching for Dark Mandalas.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, a piercing roar suddenly came from the depths of the volcanic area. Valentino became serious and immediately stopped in his tracks. The defense formed by his Sacred Power beside him was trembling violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said in confusion, "What kind of creature's roar is this? Could it be a native species of Abyssal Planet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino frowned, thinking, "To let out such an angry roar, could it be that its treasure was taken by someone? What kind of treasure could it be? And who did it? Could it be Brenda?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression turned grim. "I need to check it out. Anyway, the referee is following me. I won't run into trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Valentino quickly rushed toward the place where the Magma Devourer roared.</span></p></div>
