        <h1>Chapter 1247 Persuade</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios' voice dripped with persuasion. "If it weren't for the Court of the Sun, the Prophet Alliance, and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, we would've already claimed dominion over this new world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What we really need to do is join forces instead of clashing! Let's take out these other power players first and figure out how to divide this new world afterward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's demeanor shifted; the hostility in his eyes softened as Helios' words sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Helios was making headway in changing his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, his shift in attitude wasn't solely due to Helios' eloquence but rather the sudden involvement of the twenty or so Intermediate Deities joining the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their presence, the battlefield's dynamics had become tense. Although the Deschanel Clan still had the upper hand with five Superior Deities backing them, it was no longer a clear victory for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tides had turned, and any win would come at a significant cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's brow furrowed as doubt crept into his mind. "Are you sure you're not pulling my leg? Can the Court of the Sun, the Prophet Alliance, and that </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization really pose a threat to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios recognized the shift in Joseph's demeanor; the fire of conflict was dimming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Joseph was reconsidering his stance, no longer eager for a fight to the bitter end with the Pantheon League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All it would take to defuse this intense divine clash was a little nudge in the right direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios continued, "What I'm telling you is true! The Court of the Sun is a tough nut to crack. Once the strongest superpower on the Blue Planet, they've grown increasingly elusive. They rarely show their faces anymore, and their numbers have dwindled. Maybe the upheaval in the world has left them weaker than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can assure you, the Prophet Alliance and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization are no slouches compared to us! The Prophet Alliance isn't particularly ambitious; they tend </span><span>to steer clear of outside conflicts and don't seem interested in world domination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization? They're a serious threat. If we go to war and end up tearing each other apart, the only ones who'll benefit are them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios quickly painted a vivid picture of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect they're the descendants of the </span><span>Shadowveil</span><span> Society, which was once a powerful force in the eastern continent during the Age of Gods. Their Stealth Art is strikingly similar to the </span><span>Etherwalk</span><span> Technique. Even I would struggle to see through their Stealth Art! Facing their assassins? I'd have a hard time defending against them. They are definitely our biggest concern."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Shadowveil</span><span> Society? If it's really them, we're in a heap of trouble! I wonder how many of them are still kicking around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios said, "Joseph, I can guarantee that the ones who broke into your place are definitely not from the Pantheon League! This might be a setup! The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization could be using us as pawns!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They steal from your clan, frame us, and then sit back to watch the chaos unfold! Think about it&mdash;only the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's assassins could slip in and out of your place, using Stealth Arts to make off with your valuables without a sound!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Helios spoke, Joseph's expression shifted, realization dawning on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it really be a conspiracy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization swipe the Sanctuary Casket and then pin the blame on the Pantheon League? Are they trying to spark a war between the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League so they can profit from our mutual destruction?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, we can't let this war continue!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's voice was steely, his resolve hardening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a nearby parallel dimension, Osborne couldn't help but feel a mix of shock and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't even had the chance to set the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization up for the blame yet, and here was Helios, deftly shifting the narrative to pin it all on them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization was getting a raw deal here, but for Osborne, this was a nightmare scenario.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted the Deschanel Clan to fear the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, maybe even strike against them, but he absolutely could not allow the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League to bury the hatchet and join forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a line he couldn't let them cross!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League teamed up, Osborne would be staring down the barrel of a more formidable and difficult opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once the Deschanel Clan returned to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, they'd undoubtedly wipe out all superpowers within </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> borders, aiming to unify the region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family would be the first to go, no doubt about it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Joseph on the verge of being swayed by Helios, ready to call off the war, Osborne realized he couldn't afford to wait any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to act now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locking onto a target from the Deschanel Clan, Osborne zeroed in on an Intermediate </span><span>Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the one!" he thought, a smirk creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Intermediate Deity from the Deschanel Clan was currently fending off six Junior Deities from the Pantheon League. Despite being outnumbered, he was holding his own, pushing back against them with impressive skill, leaving the Pantheon League's members in a state of utter disarray.</span></p></div>
