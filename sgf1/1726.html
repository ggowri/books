        <h1>Chapter 1725 What Plan?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's mind raced as she replayed Aldrich and Alfred's words, her face a mask of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?! Why, after I'm already 'dead,' are they still planning to strike against the </span><span>Gellar family and the Mystic Feather Clan? Why annihilate the millions living in Wild Flame City?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did we do to deserve this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't we, the Mystic Feather Clan, subjects under Lord Malevolence's banner?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would the Paramount Supreme Clan do this to us? Why?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of betrayal settled heavily on her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Mystic Feather Clan had always treated the Human Community with kindness</span><span>, </span><span>never bullying humans or turning away from those in need</span><span>. T</span><span>hey had never betrayed Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When engaging in battle against the Human Community, the Mystic Feather warriors had never faltered in their duty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>War, in Hannah's eyes, held no moral absolutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah believed they hadn't done anything wrong; they merely couldn't stand by as various races exploited and oppressed the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, those very actions had incited the Bowman family to wage war against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Aldrich and Alfred attacking the Mystic Feather Clan, wanting to wipe out a million souls of the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City, ignited a burning fury within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bitter laugh escaped her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was such a fool! I thought if I went to the Bowman family and let them kill me, they'd back off from pursuing the Gellar family and the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I see how naive I was! If I had gone through with that, my death would have been meaningless! The Gellar family and the Mystic Feather Clan wouldn't escape annihilation either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled as despair loomed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what can we do now? The Bowman family, alongside the Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan in Wild Flame City, are gearing up to attack. With the Mystic Feather Clan's current strength, we won't stand a chance! What can I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's anxiety spiked as she turned to Osborne, her expression desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm, having foreseen this outcome long before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What you need to do now is alert the Gellar family. Inform the Mystic Feather Clan about the impending attack and get them ready for battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah shook her head in frustration. "Prepare for battle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It won't be enough! The Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan in Wild Flame City are just as powerful as the Mystic Feather Clan. Add in the Bowman family and Aldrich, a mid-stage Deity King, and even if we steel ourselves for a fight, the Mystic Feather Clan will be doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair filled her eyes as she realized the odds stacked against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, his tone unfazed, "If you can't fight, then you need to escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah couldn't help but wear a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Escape? There are over a million Mystic Feather Clan members in Wild Flame City! How are we supposed to flee? Where would we even go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne remained composed. "Who says we can't? I have a plan that could save the Mystic Feather Clan of Wild Flame City from destruction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah perked up, hope flickering in her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of answering right away, Osborne pulled out a Sanctuary Gem. He quickly manipulated it using spatial power</span><span> and</span><span> transform</span><span>ed</span><span> the Sanctuary Gem into a Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne handed the Dimensional Microcosm to Hannah and said, "This Dimensional Microcosm has a radius of six miles. If you squeeze in a bit, it could easily hold a million members of the Mystic Feather Clan from Wild Flame City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you believe they can't take on the combined forces of the Demonic Dragon Clan, Soaring Lion Clan, and the Bowman family, let them all enter the Dimensional Microcosm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They can hide inside</span><span>. I</span><span>t's their only chance at survival!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah stood frozen, staring at the Dimensional Microcosm, her heart racing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Celestara, a Dimensional Microcosm was an incredibly rare treasure, something even the Mystic Feather Clan had never possessed. But now, Osborne casually handed her a Dimensional Microcosm, as if it were nothing more than a trivial matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit her like a bolt of lightning: with this Dimensional Microcosm, she could save them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everyone from the Mystic Feather Clan was inside, she could carry them away or find them a safe place to settle down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, their lives were spared!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought exhilarated her, and gratitude flooded her heart as she looked up at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's seriousness was palpable as she addressed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, thank you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for you, I would have made a terrible mistake and walked right into the Bowman family's trap! I wouldn't have realized how despicable they really are, plotting to wipe out everyone in the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you! You're my savior, the Gellar family's savior, and the savior of the Mystic Feather Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise I'll repay you for this! But right now, I have to hurry back to the Gellar family before they make their move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clutched the Dimensional Microcosm tightly</span><span> and</span><span> determination sh</span><span>one</span><span> in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded, saying, "Sounds good! Best of luck, and don't hesitate to reach out if you run into trouble!"</span></p></div>
