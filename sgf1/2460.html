        <h1>Chapter 2368 Exhausting All Efforts-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became serious. The Ascending Sacred Sanctum ultimately couldn't hold on. Its shield completely collapsed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the current Ascending Sacred Sanctum, being able to withstand three attacks from Isidore, an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior, was already impressive, unless the Warfare Ancient Tree could completely repair it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, even though the Warfare Ancient Tree is extraordinary, completely repairing the Ascending Sacred Sanctum would require a significant amount of time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, it's already too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I do?" Osborne quickly turned his head to glance at Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could clearly feel that the auras of the three had already merged significantly with the aura of the Elven Mother Tree, but complete fusion would still take some time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Isidore clearly wouldn't give them that time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's not worry about the Ascending Sacred Sanctum for now. We must kill Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood first. We absolutely cannot let them merge with the Elven Mother Tree," Isidore roared angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, he charged straight at the three of them, his eyes filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't stop him at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The defensive shield of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum had completely collapsed. Osborne needed time to reopen the shield. But that amount of time was enough for Isidore to kill Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood ten times over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne bit his lower lip, feeling extremely anxious and furious, thinking, "What should I do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood were killed by Isidore, it wouldn't matter. After all, Osborne had already copied their life essences and could revive them later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the key issue is, if they die, they won't be able to merge with the Elven Mother Tree, nor can they harness its power to create a passage out of Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that case, Osborne wouldn't be able to leave Elf City and might even be captured and killed by Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And if he dies, who will revive Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was extremely anxious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!" Isidore's expression was extremely ferocious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His attack had already reached near Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood. As long as he struck them, he could immediately stop them from merging with the Elven Mother Tree, or even seriously injure them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, something else happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a buzzing sound, an incredibly massive and peculiar tree suddenly appeared near Uriah. Immediately, a dense fog emerged, enveloping Uriah and Osborne along with the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That tree was the Warfare Ancient Tree! And the fog was the Warfare Mist!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At such a critical moment, the Warfare Ancient Tree actually left Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, then came outside and released the Warfare Mist to protect Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, Isidore's attack was blocked by the Warfare Mist. The Warfare Mist began to shake violently but did not break; instead, it completely absorbed Isidore's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Isidore was utterly shocked. "What is this thing? Damn it! Whatever you are, you won't stop me from killing them. Let's attack together and break this damn mist."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore's temper was fully exposed. His expression was extremely anxious. He could feel that the fusion between Uriah, Hilaria, Sherwood, and the Elven Mother Tree had reached the most critical moment. If he couldn't break through the mist and stop their fusion in time, it would be even more impossible for him to obtain the Elven Mother Tree in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore attacked the Warfare Mist frantically. However, the Warfare Mist at this moment was personally cast by the Warfare Ancient Tree, almost as powerful as the defensive shield of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Isidore and the attacks of over a dozen warriors at Empyrean Sacredness could make the Warfare Mist tremble, they couldn't break it in a short time.</span></p></div>
