        <h1>Chapter 1176 Ethereal Glow</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain stood frozen, his jaw-dropping in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Using nine strands of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's core energy to refine Divine Bone and Divine Flesh? How is that even possible? This kind of thing shouldn't happen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All those years of hard-earned experience felt worthless in this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once a Deity Overlord himself, Cain had encountered countless prodigies and geniuses during the Age of Gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he had never been so utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is wasteful! Utterly wasteful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His emotions churned&mdash;envy, jealousy, and a twinge of heartache. Only he understood just how precious and vital the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Cain had managed to get even a drop of that energy back in the day, he would have made significant strides in his power. Even if he still couldn't defeat the God of Night, he wouldn't have been so easily overpowered, nor would the God of Night have been able to forcibly strip the Lotus from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's eyes burned red with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Osborne draw on nine strands of core energy to refine his Divine Bone and Divine Flesh made Cain wish he could just eliminate Osborne right then and there, snatching away that precious energy for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, he was powerless to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain could only stand by helplessly as Osborne's Divine Bone and Divine Flesh grew stronger and purer, witnessing the core energy of the Lotus being squandered on someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is already on a different level compared to divine power, and its core energy is even more potent! Just </span><span>imagine how powerful a Divine Body forged with this energy would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it reach Level Five? Level Six?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or even... Level Seven?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain had no idea&mdash;such feats had never been recorded before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only conclude that Osborne was no longer in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer magnitude of nine strands of core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus was overwhelming, making the refining process for Osborne's Divine Bone and Divine Flesh not only effortless but also swift. Though he hadn't fully transformed yet, he was strong enough to withstand the Lotus' overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body was no longer crumbling; instead, it was becoming more robust and refined with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had crossed the threshold of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Cain, this was a silver lining. If Osborne was safe, that meant he could follow him out of this hellish underground lair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, I thought he was a goner for sure. I was pretty rough with him and even insulted him. What if he decides to get back at me later? Or worse, what if he just leaves me behind when he escapes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain felt a pang of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had known Osborne would survive, he would have kept up the charade a little longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness he can't really touch me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, I was once the master of the Primordial Crimson Lotus. My fusion with it reached the fifth step! Even with my fragmented soul, the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity protects me. Not even the God of Night can touch me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless this kid merges with the Lotus to the same level, he won't stand a chance against me! Hmph, once we're out of this cursed place, I'll find my opportunity to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll regain my strength and then deal with this brat, reclaiming the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity for myself! This Cosmic Treasure belongs to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint sparked in Cain's eyes, determination hardening his resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne was completely oblivious to what Cain was thinking. Instead, he was buzzing with excitement as he felt every fiber of his being transforming. Under the refining power of the nine core energies from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, his flesh and blood were rapidly becoming perfect and powerful, morphing into a Divine Body. He finally allowed himself to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Finally, I won't die! And what's even better, this misfortune has turned into a blessing. With such a powerful force refining my Divine Bones and Flesh, combined with the Breath of Celestial, my Divine Body will be immensely strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe, by the time my Divine Body is fully formed, I could actually reach an unprecedented Level Seven! Starting as a Level Seven Solar Divine Body, I'd have a real shot at surpassing a Level Eight Galactic Divine Body or even a Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body, evolving into an Omnipotent Divine Body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was practically bubbling over with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, he felt his bones and flesh pushing toward their limits&mdash;they were </span><span>ready to transform!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metamorphosis was beginning! His bones and flesh were now fully engaged in the transition to Divine Bone and Divine Flesh. This was a pivotal moment; the quality of this transformation would determine the ceiling of his future achievements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with anticipation, Osborne could hardly contain himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that instant, his Divine Bones and Divine Flesh burst forth with Radiance, merging into a brilliant Ethereal Glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft, reddish glow enveloped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Red Ethereal Glow&mdash;it's a sign of a Level One Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the transformation isn't over yet! A Level Two Divine Body will glow orange, Level Three will be yellow, Level Four green, Level Five a soothing teal, Level Six blue, and Level Seven will shine purple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just how many levels of Ethereal Glow will my Divine Body ultimately achieve?"</span></p></div>
