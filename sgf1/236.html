        <h1>Chapter 236 War of Madness</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, everything is ready as you requested. It's all in the warehouse," Valentin said, his tone respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, a glint of satisfaction in his eyes. "Good. I'll head to the warehouse first, then we're off to the diamond mine. I'm eager to see what kind of traps and schemes the Chevalier family has set for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne and Valentin made their way to the warehouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, they were greeted by a sight that filled Osborne with satisfaction. The space was brimming with an array of combat robots and drones, numbering in the hundreds, all fully charged and ready for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a subtle wave of his hand, Osborne activated his spatial power, opening a portal to the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, all the combat robots and drones were sucked into the void, disappearing from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin watched in awe, his expression a mix of shock and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power! Mr. Augustine, you actually have spatial power? That's a rare and top-tier ability, almost unheard of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled modestly, "I've only recently unlocked it, so let's keep this under wraps, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the two of them were in a car, leaving the </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services compound behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A convoy of several vehicles trailed closely behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, as Osborne prepared to meet the Chevalier family at their diamond mine to finalize the agreement, he didn't mobilize the entire </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services team. Instead, he brought along just ten elite fighters, all veterans of the Silent Valley battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Derek had already caught wind of their movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A subordinate reported, "We've spotted activity from </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services. They've sent out about six vehicles, with no more than a dozen people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's expression turned icy. "A dozen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're asking for trouble if they think they can take us lightly. We have three hundred </span><span>ready</span><span> at the diamond mine, and they show up with just a handful? Ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they're skilled, they're dead meat this time! Keep your eyes peeled on </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services. The moment they make a move, I want to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek soon arrived at the diamond mine, a subterranean marvel and one of the oldest and most productive diamond mines in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, renowned throughout </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> for its exceptional quality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This mine had once belonged to the Sinclair family, who had amassed incredible wealth from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At their peak, they employed thousands of guards to protect their precious resources, making them a force to be reckoned with among the ancient families of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a century ago, tragedy struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A miner, digging deep within the caverns, unearthed a blood diamond the size of a fist. This gem was not only of unparalleled quality but also contained a mysterious power that could rapidly elevate a person's power if harnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sinclair family, recognizing the value of the blood diamond, treated it as a treasure. They ramped up their mining efforts and soon discovered nearly a hundred more high-quality blood diamonds. Their power surged, rivaling even the oldest families in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with great power came great attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somehow, news of the blood diamonds leaked, sending shockwaves throughout </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ancient families from Newport City offered staggering sums&mdash;hundreds of billions, even trillions&mdash;to acquire the mine. Powerful individuals even offered billions just for a single blood diamond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the Sinclair family turned them all down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more they resisted, the more desperate the other factions became. The allure of the blood diamonds drove them to take risks, leading to thefts and skirmishes that escalated into full-blown battles, drawing in more and more players into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the depths of the diamond mine, a battle erupted that would change the entire landscape of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This conflict became known as the War of Madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every combatant was driven by a ferocious intensity, fighting relentlessly to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ancient Sinclair family, whose lineage spanned a millennium, was utterly wiped out in this war. Nearly sixty percent of </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> martial masters and power masters perished in the conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the underground kings of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> at the time, emerged victorious. They defeated numerous ancient families, ended the War of Madness, and took control of the diamond mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their victory came at a high cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite seizing the mine, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> found no blood diamonds, which had already been completely extracted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the coveted blood diamonds, the mine's value was severely diminished. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> suffered massive losses, and it took them decades to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, the Godfather rose to prominence, defeating the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> and driving them out of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather then became the new ruler of </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> underworld. Even though Godfather's men also searched for blood diamonds, they came up empty-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the Godfather decided to auction off the diamond mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was ten years ago, and the auction price at that time was 15 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite a decade of development, no blood diamonds were found, but the mine continued to yield a substantial </span><span>amount</span><span> of high-quality diamonds each year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its value was now easily over 10 billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek walked through the mining area, his gaze cold and distant as he surveyed the shadowy tunnels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within those tunnels hid over three hundred elite fighters, along with numerous </span><span>guards with lesser skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should Osborne dare to approach, these defenders would swarm and eliminate them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek commanded with icy resolve, "Get everyone ready!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services has sent their best. If we take them out, they'll be nothing but a toothless tiger destined for extinction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They dare to kill my son Apollo. I want them all dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, one of his men rushed up, breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chief, the </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services team has arrived. Their convoy is already inside the mine. Should we strike now?"</span></p></div>
