        <h1>Chapter 497 Lady Witch</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, not far from the area where Osborne and Bruce were fighting, two figures were observing the situation from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faint ripples of water completely enveloped them, allowing them to blend seamlessly into the environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a man and a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was tall and beautiful. It was Isa who stood with her arms crossed, watching Osborne in the distance. Her expression was calm, but upon closer inspection, one could see the worry in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A step behind her stood a solid, middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the true ruler of this sea, Bryce was the leader of the </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain pirates, a Class AAA powerhouse who possessed the Trident of Poseidon. On the sea, he could even fight above his rank, not losing to a Class S Supreme Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Godfather and the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were unwilling to fight him at sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was an absolute top figure worldwide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, he seemed somewhat injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood half a step behind Isa, his expression extremely cautious, leaning slightly forward. Occasionally, he glanced at Isa, his eyes filled with admiration and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce could not help but feel fear because Isa inflicted the injuries on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Bryce was preparing to leave </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain to come here as agreed and assist Osborne but discovered that George, the chief disciple of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, had suddenly appeared near </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce immediately locked onto George, intending to stop him and inquire about his purpose for coming to </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after George noticed that Bryce was pursuing him, he did not stay to fight. Instead, he relied on his greater speed to continuously entangle Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His aim was simply to delay Bryce, preventing him from helping Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Bryce had no way to deal with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Bryce did not know what to do, Isa suddenly appeared. She mysteriously appeared behind George, wearing a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a single slap, Isa knocked George unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce watched from a distance, stunned, because George was mighty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was only one step away from breaking through to Class S. Even Bryce, without the Trident of Poseidon, would not dare claim he could defeat George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet this invincible George did not even have a chance to react before being knocked out by Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even know who had struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce swallowed hard and hurriedly approached Isa respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Lady Witch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa casually tossed George into the sea and turned to Bryce, saying, "I heard you demanded ten billion as a reward from Osborne before agreeing to help him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's expression stiffened, giving rise to a bad premonition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could react, Isa kicked him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really have big ambitions. I only charged him twenty million for my help, yet you dared to ask for ten billion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you are five hundred times stronger than me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Isa kicked Bryce again, and he dared not dodge or escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly begged for mercy. "Lady Witch, it's all a misunderstanding. If I had known you only charged him twenty million to help him, I wouldn't have dared to ask him for ten billion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I would only have dared to ask for two hundred dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you are at least one hundred thousand times stronger than me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong. I truly apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce continued to plead for mercy, and after receiving a few more kicks from Isa, she finally let him go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then they came here together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce looked at Isa's cold profile and couldn't help but feel a bit fearful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, in the distance, Osborne had just managed to turn the tables and kill Chris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was immediately astonished. "Lady Witch, he actually killed Chris."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce found it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris was also a disciple of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he wasn't as powerful as George, he was certainly not weak. The King selected his disciples very strictly. Only those with extraordinary talent and characteristics had the chance to become his disciples and receive his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris was an extremely powerful psychic metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though young, he had already reached Class AA strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce had thought that Osborne could never be Chris's opponent. When he saw Osborne being beaten by Chris to the point of spitting blood, he almost intervened to help, but Isa stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had found it very strange, wondering, "Why did Isa not let me save Osborne?" Until now, seeing Osborne kill Chris, Bryce finally understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked at Isa again, his expression became even more admiring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lady Witch, why Osborne wasn't injured? Even a Class AAA expert would be affected by Chris's mental attacks. It would be very hard for a Class AA psychic metahuman to remain unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did Osborne manage to do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce asked the doubts in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa glanced at him and calmly replied, "You want to know? But I'm not going to tell you. This is his secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Isa ignored Bryce and focused on Osborne from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She touched her rosy lips and thought, "How do I suddenly feel like kissing? Because of that bad guy?"</span></p></div>
