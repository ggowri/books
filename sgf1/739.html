        <h1>Chapter 739 Returning to Newport City</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded gratefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to go to Tethynia to attend Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony, but it wasn't just for the spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to go because Tethynia was one of the strongholds of the Aberrants!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was deeply concerned about Godfather's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that if Godfather really encountered any danger, he might be able to provide more help in Tethynia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma suddenly interjected, "I want to go with Osborne! How could I miss such an event? I've also reached Class AAA, and I need this kind of opportunity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're already helping Osborne with a new identity, why not make one for me too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Emma grabbed Caleb's arm and began to shake it playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb looked helpless. "Why would you go? Tethynia is one of the strongholds of the Aberrants. If your identities are exposed, you'll both be in danger! You two are the most talented young generation of the Augustine family. I can't rest easy about this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why are you okay with letting Osborne go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma pouted. "Besides, we'll be in disguise with new identities, just going to attend the Honor Quest Ceremony. As long as we don't expose Satan's Eye, how could the Aberrants possibly find us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care, I'm definitely going! If you won't help me with a new identity, I'll sneak over there myself! I'm Class AAA too; I don't believe you can lock me up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma started to act spoiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb looked utterly helpless. "Alright, but you have to convince your grandfather first! If that old stubborn man finds out I helped sneak you over, he'll come after me for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Emma's face lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll talk to my grandpa. He dotes on me, so he won't refuse! Besides, now that I'm Class AAA, he might not even be able to beat me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb chuckled, "So, how about we depart in five days? I'll sort out your new identities and notify you. Don't tell anyone about this. You must make sure no one knows you're going to Tethynia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even people from the Augustine family can't know! It's not that I don't trust our family, but this is too serious&mdash;we can't afford any mistakes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb's expression suddenly became incredibly serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Emma exchanged a glance and nodded solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, we know what to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb nodded and left. After he left, only Osborne and Emma remained in the training field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma looked at Osborne with a smug expression as if showing off that she'd managed to tag along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes and ignored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still pondering how to handle his relationship with Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Clarissa wasn't around during this time; otherwise, Osborne would've had a headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "With the Aberrants retreating from Rosmandi, they won't be making any moves for a while. It will only be when the King of the Aberrants clones stronger Evolved Humans with the Divine Bone Crystal that they will start another war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, Clarissa should be safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also need to return to Newport City to take Anastasia to the medical research institute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his plan set, Osborne quickly prepared to return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ordered the members of the Blood Demon Organization to return to Newport City and head to Training Base No. 6, where they would continue training and await his commands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That afternoon, Osborne boarded a flight to Newport City with Anastasia and Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning to Newport City, Emma finally stopped clinging to Osborne and returned to her own home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Osborne arrived at the medical research institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the headquarters of the Draco Group, located in the most bustling area of Newport City. It had 108 floors above ground and 28 floors underground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All 28 underground levels belonged to the research institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the entire research institute belonged to Osborne, and he easily made his way inside. The medical institute was on the eighth underground floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Passing through layer upon layer of strict defenses, Osborne finally reached the institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, rest assured. Our medical research institute is the most advanced in the world! We've conquered 99% of the diseases known to man. No matter what strange illness your sister has, she will receive the best treatment here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greeting Osborne was a woman in her fifties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the head of the medical institute, named Makenzie Harvey. Her medical skills were highly esteemed, making her one of the top medical talents of the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Makenzie arrange for doctors to take his sister for an examination, Osborne felt incredibly nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he was even more anxious than when surrounded by a dozen Class AAA Evolved Humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Zoe gripped Osborne's hand tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Anastasia will be alright! If she knows you've been so worried about her all this time, she'll definitely get better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Zoe spoke, Osborne's expression softened a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and asked, "Zoe, you're close to breaking through to Class A, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe smiled and nodded.</span></p></div>
