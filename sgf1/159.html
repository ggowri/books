        <h1>Chapter 159 Defeated</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's face immediately turned pale at his words. "Stop! Name your price! The Radcliffe family can give you whatever you want; just don't hurt her!" She pleaded anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hammond sneered, "How laughable! We are the most loyal warriors of the King of the Aberrants. You are insulting us by trying to bribe us with money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hammond, perhaps we shouldn't kill her just yet," Harland interjected, stopping Hammond. With a sly grin, he continued, "Our orders were to kill Ms. Radcliffe. But if we capture her alive and bring her back for research, wouldn't that be an even greater achievement?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hammond's eyes lit up at the idea. Nodding in agreement, he said, "Alright then. Let's slaughter the rest and take Ms. Radcliffe alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move!" He commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Hammond and Harland sprang into action, followed closely by their eight werewolf subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a terrifying roar, the werewolves, immensely powerful and incredibly fast, charged into the ranks of the Personal Guards. Despite the guards opening fire, their bullets barely scratched these fearsome creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos erupted as the formation broke apart. The guards fell injured one by one; the twenty-strong team was no match for the eight werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, they were all doomed to be torn apart by the beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! These shape-shifting werewolves have at least D-level, maybe even D+ level strength! Our weapons can hardly harm them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was shocked, immediately rushing to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, you'd better take care of yourself first!" At this moment, Harland appeared before Barlyn and sneered. His icy gaze bore down on Barlyn, exerting immense pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harland was a Class C+ martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was a Class C earth elemental metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, metahumans were stronger and more difficult to deal with than martial artists, but only when they were at the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harland, however, was half a level higher than Barlyn. This difference was enough to bridge the gap between a metahuman and a martial artist, especially since Harland's experience in combat was evident. In contrast, Barlyn had hardly fought before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without time to think, Barlyn quickly summoned Earth Spikes from beneath Harland, aiming to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such petty tricks!" Harland scoffed, swiftly dodging Barlyn's attack with eerily agile movements. Barlyn found himself unable to lock onto Harland's position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harland soon closed the distance and threw a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn hastily raised an Earth Wall for defense, taking the full brunt of Harland's blow. The impact created a loud crash, and cracks spread across the wall, which quickly crumbled under Harland's relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's face turned deathly pale. He thought, "I can't win. There is no way I can win this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Donna was in an even worse situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Already wounded from Harris' sneak attack, she was at a severe disadvantage against Hammond, who had the upper hand from the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hammond waved his hand, and countless green Vine Phantoms appeared in the air, lashing out at Donna like whips. She gritted her teeth through the pain, conjuring an Earth Wall to block the attack, but the vines sapped the wall's strength and shattered it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vines absorbed the energy from the Earth Wall, growing thicker and stronger. More and more robust vines filled the sky, enveloping Donna completely. With no other options, she formed an Earth Sphere around herself for protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the vines rapidly drained the sphere's power. At this rate, Donna would soon be exhausted and die under Hammond's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna quickly surveyed the surrounding chaos. She saw Barlyn struggling against Harland, the Personal Guards, and the third and fourth Bodyguard Unit being overwhelmed by the werewolves. The situation was dire, and despair flickered in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Donna trembled. Her face was a mix of frustration and guilt. The thought of Clarissa being captured and subjected to some nefarious experiments haunted her. She felt utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Hammond's wood powers completely countered my own. I can't even muster any effective defense. I'm barely holding on to myself. How could I save anyone else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation spread among the defenders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Injuries and casualties began to mount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A werewolf viciously pounced on a member of the Personal Guards. The guard was a skilled fighter trained by the Radcliffe family. The werewolf ripped open the guard's abdomen with razor-sharp claws. Intestines and organs spilled out onto the ground, the stench of blood filling the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams of agony echoed as Barlyn was struck by Harland. A powerful punch shattered his shoulder, sending him flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More Personal Guards rushed to help Barlyn, but their desperation made them reckless. This left them vulnerable, and one by one, they fell to the werewolves' savage attacks. Their bodies were torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Donna's eyes turned red with fury and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Hammond seized his opportunity. His vines shattered the Earth Wall and ensnared Donna, wrapping tightly around her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Donna Radcliffe, it's over!" Hammond sneered. "You all can go to hell now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the vines constricted mercilessly.</span></p></div>
