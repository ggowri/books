        <h1>Chapter 1514 Life Power</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reflected that it had been a while since he broke through to the Superior Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had been reluctant to use the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to boost his strength, the upgrade of Satan's Eye to Level Nine had equipped him with Infinite Devouring Eyes. This allowed him to continuously absorb vast amounts of energy to aid in his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Osborne had finally reached the peak of the Superior Deity realm, and he was closing in on Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope I can break through to Transcendent Deity in the next few days! Once I do, if I can push my Thunder Power source past Level Six, I should be able to hold my own against an average Deity Overlord without relying on spatial or dark powers. Taking down a regular Deity Overlord should be a piece of cake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement bubbled within him at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get moving then!" Osborne declared, eager to set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah nodded in agreement but added, "Hold on! We can't just stroll out of here. Your previous display of strength has ruffled a lot of feathers among the major factions. If they catch wind of you leaving, they might strike immediately, storming in here to kidnap your people and sell them off to the slave market."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What do you suggest we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a confident smile, Hannah replied, "You want to know why there are rumors that I, Hannah, am blind and crippled? It's because no one has ever seen my true form! You're the first. If I take you with me, no one will notice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Hannah enveloped herself in a swirling mass of dark energy, which quickly expanded into a black sphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come a bit closer," she instructed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He complied, stepping beside her, and the mist wrapped around him as well. Being so close, he couldn't help but catch a delightful scent wafting from Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist, Osborne took a deep breath, glancing at her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's cheeks flushed a deep crimson. "What are you looking at?" she teased, her tone playful yet slightly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, Osborne chuckled awkwardly. "Nothing, just thought it smelled nice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her blush deepened. "You perv!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful huff, she waved her hand, causing the black mist to swirl and gradually disappear into the void, taking both her and Osborne with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we're invisible now! Unless there's a Deity King nearby, no one will be able to detect our departure," she announced confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this dark power? No, it's not just dark power. At least, it doesn't seem to be purely dark power; it's mixed with something else. Dark power can conceal our bodies but struggles to hide our presence completely. I feel like our life signatures are entirely masked! What kind of power is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah shot him a surprised look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can sense all that? You're right; it's not just dark power. It's infused with life power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I inherited my father's dark power and my mother's life power, allowing me to perfectly mask all traces of our presence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Life power? What's that?" Osborne asked, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah paused, deep in thought. After a moment, she replied, "Do you know about the Goddess of Life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?!" Osborne's eyes widened in shock as he stared at Hannah, suddenly realizing the implications of her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah nodded, her expression serious. "You guessed right! Life power is the very force once wielded by the Goddess of Life! Most people only know that life power can save lives, even bringing back those who have passed away. But they understand very little about its other capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In essence, life power manipulates vitality! The ability to save lives is really just about replenishing that vitality. So, hiding our life signatures is a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, my life power pales in comparison to that of the Goddess of Life. It's said that at her peak, with just a thought, she could reduce the vitality of billions to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sadly, she fell at the hands of Lord Malevolence! Even he regrets that, regretting the day he killed the Goddess of Life! Since then, no one has come close to mastering life power to her level&mdash;not even a fraction of it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, while I can wield life power, if you were to die, I wouldn't be able to save you. I could help heal some injuries and restore a bit of vitality, but that's about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne listened, completely astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's still incredibly impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, they had already left the estate and were walking along the path. The shadows lurking around them were completely oblivious to their presence, unable to sense them or realize they had departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt a bit like Osborne's Phantom Steps, as if they were traversing a parallel space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Phantom Steps was still a notch above this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move! I'll take you to our Essence Crystal mine. We need to deal with those Deathborn over there as soon as possible!" Hannah urged.</span></p></div>
