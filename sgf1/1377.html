        <h1>Chapter 1376 Deathborn?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne settled into the modest stone house belonging to Harry and Amelia, a structure that seemed to sag under the weight of its own history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, over a hundred similar stone dwellings formed the heart of Rodriguez Village, a place where humans struggled to survive under the oppressive rule of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this village, everyone&mdash;young and old&mdash;was forced into the mines to extract Essence Crystals. The amount they were required to deliver each month was calculated based on the population, meaning even the elderly and small children had to contribute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The harsh reality was that if they didn't pull their weight, the consequences would be dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What shocked Osborne the most was the sheer power of the villagers. Even infants, barely out of the cradle, exhibited Class A strength, while the adults were at least Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a bit of cultivating, they could easily break through to become Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, reaching higher realms was a different story altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Essence Crystals they mined were handed over to the Ninth Dark Deity Legion with barely anything left for themselves. They had little time or energy for personal cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, Harry stood out as an Intermediate Deity, the strongest warrior in Rodriguez Village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet despite their apparent strength, the villagers were nothing more than slaves, shackled by the Legion. They might have seemed free, but in reality, they were trapped in a cycle of relentless labor. To survive, they had to keep mining and turning over their hard-earned crystals. The Dark Deity overseers ensured that any failure to meet quotas was met with brutal punishment, a fate worse than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, they could choose to rebel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decades ago, some villagers had reached their breaking point and attempted to rise against their oppressors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the outcome was horrific.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who dared to resist were tortured for a month until they were unrecognizable, their severed heads displayed on the village gates as a grim warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those tortured were Harry and Amelia's parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, for the past few decades, despite the arduous lives the people of the Rodriguez Village endure&mdash;toiling in the </span><span>mines</span><span> day after day, with countless falling to their deaths and little to no time for rest or cultivation&mdash;none dare to rebel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For to not resist meant to live, however marginally; to resist was to guarantee one's demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne absorbed this grim reality, a heavy weight settled in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you all just escape from Rodriguez Village? There must be somewhere else you can go," he asked, his voice laced with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, </span><span>Celestara</span><span> was vast, and </span><span>surely</span><span> they could find a hiding place far from the reach of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hard-earned Essence Crystals, surrendered to the Dark Deity Legion, only serve to strengthen their might, exacerbating the oppression they inflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a vicious cycle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia exchanged glances, their expressions shifting from surprise to sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry replied, shaking his head vigorously, "Escape? How would we even do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, we're somewhat safe in the mines. Most of the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> around here have been wiped out by the Ninth Dark Deity Legion. If we leave, we'd be sitting ducks. With our current strength, we wouldn't stand a chance against those terrifying </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They can sniff us out no matter where we hide, and they'd swarm us in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staying in Rodriguez Village is the only way we can survive. Outside, it's a death sentence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock. "</span><span>Deathborn</span><span>? What are those?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia exchanged incredulous </span><span>glances,</span><span> their eyes wide with disbelief. "You don't even know what </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> are? It looks like you've really forgotten a lot. Let me fill you in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry took a deep breath, the weight of history heavy in his voice. "</span><span>Deathborn</span><span> are a special kind of life form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To understand them, you have to go back over a thousand years. Back then, Lord Malevolence led the Dark Deity Legion in a sudden invasion of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. It was catastrophic&mdash;millions of humans and deities were killed or injured in an instant, nearly wiping out our entire race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that moment on, the scent of death permeated </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. Whenever anyone tried to absorb the energy of the world, they also absorbed that scent, making the land inhospitable for cultivation and survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, the Seven Great Deity Kings managed to defeat Lord Malevolence, but they couldn't kill him. They could only seal him away. After that, they abandoned </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, deeming it too dangerous for cultivation, and sealed the entire realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What they didn't realize was how resilient humanity is. We adapted to the harsh environment and discovered that we could still harness the power of Essence Crystals to enhance our strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For a while, humanity thrived once again. If things had gone as planned, we would </span><span>have reclaimed our place as rulers of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> within a century or so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But then, out of nowhere, the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're terrifying creatures born from the very scent of death. They don't have much intelligence&mdash;think of them as wild beasts driven purely by instinct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They attack anything that's alive. Even though humanity suffered heavy losses, we could have held our ground if we banded together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the real nightmare began when the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> found Lord Malevolence."</span></p></div>
