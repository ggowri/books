        <h1>Chapter 59 Three Superpowers</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was shocked, yet he had no time to dwell on it. His immediate concern was the pack of werewolves before him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Under Clarissa&rsquo;s superpower treatment, he felt emboldened and shed his previous timidity. He dared to directly target the werewolves&rsquo; vital points regardless of his injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, the situation began to turn around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The werewolves&rsquo; individual strength did not match Osborne&rsquo;s. As a result of his newfound confidence, the werewolves began to inflict casualties, and he swiftly stabbed their hearts with the alloy dagger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although they were not afraid of pain and always managed to injure him before their demise, the holy white light continued to descend upon his head, ensuring he remained in peak condition throughout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The second werewolf was knocked down, followed by the third and fourth ones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With Satan&rsquo;s Eye activated to the extreme, Osborne killed six of the nine werewolves in less than a minute, leaving only the last three.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, unbeknownst to him, at that very moment, two figures stealthily approached Clarissa from behind. With swift transformations, they seized her head with their razor-sharp claws.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By the time he realized, it was already too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Osborne shouted with madness, his eyes suddenly bloodshot as he rushed desperately towards Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She couldn&rsquo;t die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her death would symbolize his failure in the test of heirship. Moreover, they were comrades who had fought side by side. He couldn&rsquo;t bear to see her perish before his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two werewolves had been lurking in the distance. As Osborne engaged in a fierce battle, they suddenly took action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was ensnared by three werewolves, compelled to watch helplessly as the other two used their furred, sharp claws to seize Clarissa&rsquo;s head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but shut his eyes, overwhelmed with self-blame and regret, feeling a pang in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, just as the werewolves&rsquo; sharp claws were about to strike Clarissa down, a horrifying black light suddenly exploded from her body with a loud bang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed like a pair of black wings protecting her in the middle. They fluttered gently, and the two werewolves were immediately thrown back. Their limbs were twisted and broken, and they sank to the ground, reverting to human form and unable to rise anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s complexion turned extremely pale, the black wings vanishing soon after. She swayed and nearly fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She forced a smile at Osborne. &ldquo;Osborne, don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, she slowly fell backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne took a deep breath, observing everything in astonishment and wondering what those black wings were that had suddenly burst from Clarissa&rsquo;s body. Their appearance caused his Satan&rsquo;s Eye to activate intensely as if sensing a threat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Superpower?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Another superpower?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It turned out that Clarissa didn&rsquo;t have two superpowers but three.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What a gifted girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sighed with relief and felt immensely grateful that Clarissa was safe and sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, she seemed very weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After promptly fighting off the three werewolves, Osborne rushed to Clarissa and embraced her tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa struggled to open her eyes and managed a faint smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay, yet a bit drowsy. I want to get some sleep. Be careful,&rdquo; she suddenly shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, the last three werewolves charged fearlessly toward Osborne. With her reminder, he swiftly dodged, shielding her with his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The rest no longer posed a threat to him. Despite Clarissa being unable to heal him and the blade of the alloy dagger being bent, he was unworried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A dozen seconds later, the last werewolf collapsed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With Clarissa in his arms, Osborne paused, glanced down at her, and found that she had fallen asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her long eyelashes fluttered slightly, her rosy and alluring lips pursed tightly. Her pretty face still betrayed concern for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, her physical condition was fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gunfire still echoed nearby. Osborne once again positioned the riot shield to protect himself and Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After practicing The Breath of Celestial, he grew stronger, yet he was not yet invulnerable to bullets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, the most intense battle had concluded. It would be exceedingly regrettable if he were to be killed by a bullet now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only then did Osborne look at Paul, who was several dozen yards away, taking cover behind a large tree and firing at the distant enemies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Shortly after, the gunfire ceased, and all surviving enemies, sensing the futility of their mission, quickly retreated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul finally hurried back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he saw Osborne holding the unconscious Clarissa amidst twelve werewolves who had reverted to human form lying nearby, panic suddenly gripped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let go of Ms. Radcliffe!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Pointing his gun at Osborne again, Paul was furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a cold face, Osborne said calmly, &ldquo;Captain Paul, you&rsquo;ve returned at the perfect moment. The battle is over, yet here you are pointing your gun at me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul snorted, &ldquo;What do you mean? I just went to cover your rear and buy time for you. I faced concentrated enemy fire and got hit in at least three spots. Repelling them was no small feat.&rdquo;</p></div>
