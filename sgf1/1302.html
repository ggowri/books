        <h1>Chapter 1301 Full of Confidence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For most people, reaching Level Six in elemental essence was a daunting challenge. Only Celestial Deities or even Deity Overlords typically possessed such advanced mastery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After attaining divinity, many chose to abandon the pursuit of enhancing their elemental essence, redirecting their focus instead to strengthening their Divine Body and divine power. For gods, elemental power became a secondary concern; as long as their divine power and Divine Body were formidable enough, their strength would stand unmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, a lot of elemental powers weren't particularly strong. Investing time into leveling up elemental essence could feel like a poor return on investment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless one possessed exceptionally powerful elemental powers, it often made more sense to dedicate that same time to increasing divine power and enhancing the Divine Body for a more significant leap in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who possessed spatial powers like Osborne's would never dream of neglecting it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd devote time to honing it because even a slight improvement in spatial elemental essence translated to a massive boost in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the flip side, weaker elemental powers&mdash;like shape-shifting or amplification powers&mdash;weren't worth the effort once one had ascended to godhood. Their ceilings were low. It was a waste of time to focus on upgrading their elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Level Six elemental essence seemed like a distant dream for most; even many Celestial Deities and Deity Overlords might not have achieved it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, both his space elemental essence and dark elemental power had already peaked at Level Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the continued absorption of the second core energy from the Lotus, Osborne felt confident that it wouldn't be long before both his space and dark elemental powers broke through to Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, his abilities would surge dramatically. Even as an Intermediate Deity, eliminating a Transcendent Deity warrior would no longer feel like an insurmountable challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would simply take a few moves rather than requiring him to go all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My goal is clear: I need to elevate my space elemental essence to Level Six as swiftly as possible! Then, I'll use the Sanctuary Gem to create a Dimensional Microcosm, providing a safe haven for the Augustine family to develop within. That's the plan." Osborne firmly resolved in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Osborne! What's our next move? Eighteen of their Transcendent Deity warriors managed to escape. They'll surely strike back! These aren't just any fighters, especially Terrence&mdash;he was once a top-tier Deity Overlord, a contender for the throne of Deity King. If he regains his strength, we could be in serious trouble," Divine Shadow interjected, her brow furrowed in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an air of calm, Osborne smiled, "Don't sweat it, Grandma Divine Shadow. Trust me when I say not a single one of the Deschanel Clan will get away. Terrence thinks he can hide and regain his strength to plot revenge against me? I won't give him that chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow stared at Osborne in shock. She mused, "Why isn't he panicking? What makes him so sure he can track down the fleeing members of the Deschanel Clan and take them out? Does he have a secret card up his sleeve?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking along those lines, Divine Shadow didn't press for more details. "As long as you know your plan, that's what matters! But we can't underestimate Terrence&mdash;he needs to be eliminated swiftly. Just let me know when you're ready to strike."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a grin. "Just wait a few hours, Grandma Divine Shadow. I'll be ready to act."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow raised an eyebrow, surprised. "Just a few hours?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll wait for you those few hours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she vanished in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Augustine family was busy scavenging through the remnants of the Deschanel Clan's treasures. They were unearthing a wealth of riches that had accumulated over thousands of years&mdash;far surpassing what the Augustine family had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excitement was electric as everyone scrambled to claim everything they could carry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne even overheard his grandfather Sebastian mention plans to tear down the entire outer wall of the sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled to himself but chose to remain silent about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He left the Deschanel Clan's sanctuary and arrived on a small island above the ocean. Osborne had discreetly ordered the Blood Demon members to gather there, and now over 48 hundred of them stood in formation, waiting for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he surveyed them, a satisfied smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The victory over the Deschanel Clan was largely thanks to the Blood Demon members. Without them, Osborne, along with Divine Shadow and God of Star, would've struggled merely to escape from the Deschanel Clan's twenty-nine Transcendent Deity warriors, let alone annihilate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne's next goal was to continue enhancing the power of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this battle, they had taken down eleven Transcendent Deity warriors from the Deschanel Clan, alongside numerous Superior, Intermediate, and Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A vast amount of blood energy was harvested. This energy, channeled through the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to the Blood Demon members, would empower many of them to ascend to Intermediate Deity status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Osborne's calculations, the blood energy of a single Transcendent Deity warrior could enable a hundred Blood Demon members to become Intermediate Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The energy from the eleven Transcendent Deity warriors of the Deschanel Clan would be enough for over a thousand Blood Demon members to make this leap. The Blood Demon forces were poised to gain tremendous strength.</span></p></div>
