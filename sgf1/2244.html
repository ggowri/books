        <h1>Chapter 2218 Take Action-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside the mountain, a chaotic spectacle greeted Osborne and Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All manner of creatures were crammed into the space, a dense mass of beings shackled by metal chains pulsating with divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single one of them looked utterly wretched, like livestock penned up, awaiting their turn to be sold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer quantity was mind-boggling&mdash;millions upon millions of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne used his Satan's Eye to scan the crowd. It showed that the weakest among them were at least at the Celestial Deity Level. Most were Deity Overlords, and there were even some Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also spotted a few Supernal Deity Kings in the mix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What really hit him hard was the talent of these beings. Nearly half of them were from the Human Community. Their eyes were lifeless, filled with despair, and they shuffled around like empty shells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no question about it&mdash;these were slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All these millions of beings were being trafficked to the Phantom Tide Demon Sect. The scale of this operation was massive. Gathering such a large number of beings, each at least a Celestial Deity, would have required the life-force of a small life planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phantom Tide Demon Sect warriors patrolled the area. They mercilessly lashed out at any slaves who dared to resist, leaving them bloodied and howling in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with a foul stench, a stark reminder of the suffering going on within these walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face clouded over as he witnessed the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He balled his fists tightly, and memories of his own parents came flooding back. Over twenty years ago, they had been sold to the Phantom Tide Demon Sect, enduring the same fate of beatings and humiliation at the hands of these very warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn the Phantom Tide Demon Sect!" Osborne growled under his breath, his anger reaching a boiling point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he managed to rein in his impulse to attack right away, figuring it was wiser to size up the situation first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What on earth does the Phantom Tide Demon Sect want with so many slaves?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Are they going to use them for mining?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Or resell them for a profit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Or is there something even more evil going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, casting a glance at Vince.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Vince stepped off the battleship and casually gave orders to his men. "Keep a close watch on those women on the ship. Don't let them out of their rooms! If anyone dares to step out, kill them on the spot! We can't let a single soul find out what's going on here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" the warriors responded in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince then climbed onto a platform and surveyed the sea of slaves with a smug grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad, not bad at all! The quality of this batch is top-notch! Once we sell them, we'll make a fortune in resources and Celestial Crystals! The bigwigs on Racial Convergence Planet are going to be over the moon..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to one of the warriors from the Phantom Tide Demon Sect. "Have we accounted for all the slaves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Vince Brunson! The last batch has arrived! We're all set to ship them out. The buyers have already paid the deposit. Once we deliver the goods, they'll pay the rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince nodded with a smile. "Perfect! Let's get this party started! Move it! We can't keep our buyers twiddling their thumbs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, pandemonium broke loose. The warriors roughly herded millions of slaves into metal containers, jamming thousands into each one. The slaves were packed like sardines, hardly able to move an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metal boxes were then hauled to the middle of a huge clearing.</span></p></div>
