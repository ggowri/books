        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Godfather also glanced at the six heirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze gradually fell on each of them, lingering for a few seconds and making them feel overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Godfather finally said, "You are the six most outstanding people among the younger generation of the Augustine family. Now that I am getting old, so I'll retire as the leader soon, so I need to select the heir of the Augustine family as soon as possible amongst the six of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of which, all six of them perked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they had predicted, what Godfather was about to announce was indeed about the heir selection of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, even Osborne became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Osborne could defeat the five competitors in the heir selection of the Augustine Family, he would end up being the first heir of the Augustine Family, and he would complete the sixth heir test given by Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Osborne would bring his sister, Anastasia, to Godfather's medical research laboratory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia would be saved then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Godfather, Osborne waited for him to announce the rules of </span><span>heir</span><span> selection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other five did the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Godfather didn't eagerly announce it but looked over at Emma and Osborne and smiled, "Both of you did a great job today and helped me win this bet, and we won two divine artifacts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Godfather waved his hand, and two divine artifacts instantly appeared in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them was a small shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The small shield was only the size of a palm, with a strange shape that looked like a bird with spread wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other one was a sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That sickle looked ordinary, like an old sickle that the average farmer had at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, everyone looked at the two divine artifacts with passionate eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were divine artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For any superpower, the number of divine artifacts was limited, and they would be counted clearly. Although they were the best amongst the younger generation of the Augustine family, they had never owned a divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Godfather took out the two divine artifacts in front of them. Could it be </span><span>that he was going to give them the divine artifacts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they all perked up, their eyes filled with anticipation as they straightened their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather smiled calmly, picked up the small shield, and said, "This divine artifact is called the swallow shield, and it is said to be a weapon from a deity in </span><span>Glacium</span><span>. It has a powerful defense capability, which can absorb any physical and energy attacks and convert them into the user's energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All in all, this is an extremely powerful divine artifact."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon saying that, Godfather suddenly looked at Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma tensed up, her eyes filled with nervousness and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather said gently, "These two divine artifacts are won by you, and I won't take possession of them. Emma, you have performed well in the fight, and you have defeated two Godsons from </span><span>Yalynch</span><span> who are ranked in the top ten, so I'll leave this swallow shield to you temporarily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that the swallow shield had flown to Emma's front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was instantly extremely thrilled, and her face flushed. She hurriedly took the swallow shield and held it tightly in her arms as if it were a treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At once, Vincent, Matthew, Owen, and Lance all looked at her with jealous eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A divine artifact had truly to be given away by Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Godfather gave it to Emma instead of them, so wouldn't they be jealous?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather ignored them and continued to pick up the second divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I guess it correctly, this divine artifact should be the sickle from Goddess of Grain. It's said that she wasn't a powerful deity, so this sickle is not a weapon, and it doesn't have a particularly powerful effect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Godfather finished speaking, everyone was disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the swallow shield, it seemed that this sickle from the Goddess of Grain was far too common.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was a divine artifact, so their eyes were filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather continued, "It has only two characteristics, including being strong and sharp! It is impenetrable and incredibly sharp, which can cut through anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It'll be useful if you use it properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Godfather looked over at Osborne and said calmly, "This sickle from Goddess of Grain will be given to you to use from now on! In today's fight, if you didn't save the day, we would have already lost, so you deserve it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Goddess of Grain's sickle flew to Osborne's front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hurriedly caught it and couldn't help but laugh helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A sickle again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to have a special connection with sickle-shaped weapons, as he had previously owned the Death Sickle, and he now got the Goddess of Grain's sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was a divine artifact, after all, so Osborne was still delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Goddess of Grain's sickle worked so poorly that even in Osborne's opinion, it might not help him as much as Death Sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Goddess of Grain's sickle was just strong and sharp, and it was not even on </span><span>the same level as Emma's swallow shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swallow shield had a powerful defensive ability, and it could absorb any physical and energy attacks and convert them into the user's energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is a divine artifact after all, and something is better than nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "At this moment, I can feel Vincent, Matthew, Owen, and Lance, who didn't get the divine artifacts, looking at me with envy and jealousy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly and cheerfully put Goddess of Grain's sickle away in Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather smiled faintly and looked at Osborne and Emma, saying quietly, "Don't be overjoyed. These two divine artifacts are only being given to you to use temporarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After that, as for the heir selection of the Augustine family, I hope you will obtain the top two. Otherwise, I will take back the right to use these two divine artifacts and give them to the top two of the heir selection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Emma both felt nervous as Godfather finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, Matthew, Owen, and Lance, however, had a look of excitement on their faces.</span></p></div>
