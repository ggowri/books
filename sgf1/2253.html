        <h1>Chapter 2224 Where to Go-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne took a look around at the destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high-ranking members of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect who had come to rescue Bancroft had all been wiped out by the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's roll!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got no reason to stick around on Necoton Planet any longer. We'll hop on the Translocator and head straight to Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne motioned for Isa to tag along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stepped out of the cavern, he conjured up flames and set the whole mountain ablaze to wipe out any evidence of the recent battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before they were back in Phantom Tide City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place was deathly quiet. The members of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect were completely in the dark, clueless that their leader, Bancroft, and seven top-brass executives had been taken out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused for a second, weighing his options. In the end, he decided not to go after the Phantom Tide Demon Sect anymore. Sure, they were neck-deep in the slave trade and had sold his parents, but the real masterminds&mdash;the seven core leaders&mdash;were already six feet under. The rank-and-file members had no inkling about the slave business, and offing them wouldn't achieve anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go," Osborne said, then led Isa and Maddox towards the Spatial Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five hundred Celestial Crystals per person to transport to Racial Convergence Planet!" The middle-aged warrior operating the Translocator said coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five hundred Celestial Crystals was a fortune!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was in a bind. This was the only Cosmic Translocator that could take them to Racial Convergence Planet, so he had no alternative but to fork over the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, though, five hundred Celestial Crystals were peanuts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out one thousand five hundred Celestial Crystals and handed them to the guy. Then he, Isa, and Maddox stepped onto the Translocator platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Translocator was a behemoth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which part of Racial Convergence Planet are you three aiming for?" The middle-aged man asked with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attitude had done a complete 180 now that Osborne had paid up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "We can pick the destination?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man let out a little laugh. "You must be new to using our Cosmic Translocator! Of course you can choose! Our Cosmic Translocator is linked to the Stellar Formation Diagram of Racial Convergence Planet. You can get dropped off in neutral areas, or even in the territories of the Evernight Court or the Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, you won't end up in the capitals of the Evernight Court or the Glorious Divine Kingdom, mind you. It'll be some out-of-the-way places...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But once you're on Racial Convergence Planet, Cosmic Translocators are all over the place. Getting to the capitals of the Evernight Court or the Glorious Divine Kingdom will be a piece of cake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the man finished talking, Osborne started to ponder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Where should we go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Evernight Court or the Glorious Divine Kingdom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly nixed the idea of going to the Evernight Court. He was a total newbie when it came to that place. As the most powerful force on Racial Convergence Planet, the Evernight Court had a ton of rules, and he wasn't up for being tied down by them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Then what about the Glorious Divine Kingdom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew the Glorious Divine Kingdom like the back of his hand. After all, he was born there in his past life. He'd spent over a hundred years there. While Osborne couldn't say he knew every single corner, he definitely knew it better than the Evernight Court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, he was super familiar with the capital city of the Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to pay homage to his mother from his past life and, for that revenge he sought, he needed to be in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, specifically its capital city!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne realized he was still too weak. Even if he went to the capital, he wouldn't be able to do much of anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to find a place to build up his strength first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Then we'll go to Mystic Sirius Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That worked perfectly. Mystic Sirius Sect was also a Second-rate Power within the Glorious Divine Kingdom. He could leverage Maddox's connections to settle there temporarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his plan formulated, Osborne spoke up, "We're going to the Glorious Divine Kingdom!"</span></p></div>
