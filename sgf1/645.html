        <h1>Chapter 645 Medusa Mark</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was grim as he clenched his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His back injury was slow to heal, and his spiritual energy had not yet recovered enough for interdimensional travel. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Duke Medusa caught up to him, he would be in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he had managed to escape, Duke Medusa, at Class AAA, was faster. And the distance between them was quickly closing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes glowed with a cold, petrifying light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stone skin around Osborne began to spread again. At this rate, he feared he would be completely petrified before his spiritual energy recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I going to die here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip, desperately searching for a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack, crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa's petrification power was overwhelming. Osborne's martial art aura offered no resistance, and he felt his body gradually stiffening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed gradually slowed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! If I had known this would happen, I would have fused the dark and light elemental essence to raise my Devil's Light to level eight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That would have been enough to withstand Duke Medusa's petrification power. But it's too late now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the petrification reached his chest, he realized he had only seconds left before being completely immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a force erupted from his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the power of Cain's Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without his control, the Blood Cross surged, transforming him into a Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he had long </span><span>red</span><span> hair, sharp teeth and nails, and a pale, angular face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt an extraordinary surge of power, halting the spread of petrification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though relieved, he knew the crisis was not over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa was still closing in at an alarming speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't escape! You lack the spiritual energy for spatial power, don't you? I'll enjoy torturing you until you become a perfect stone sculpture!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa's chilling voice dripped with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transformation not only suppressed petrification but also increased his speed. While he still couldn't match Duke Medusa, he was now faster than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using some of his spiritual energy, he activated his wind elemental power, propelling himself forward and pulling away from Duke Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joy surged within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His current speed had surpassed Duke Medusa. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he continued to maintain this speed, he would be able to get rid of her even if he couldn't perform interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his relief was short-lived as he noticed Duke Medusa's speed had increased again, surpassing him and slowly closing the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grimly, Osborne thought, "You don't give me a break. If I survive today, I'll make sure to beat you to a pulp when I reach Class AAA!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became furious and ran away desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he fled, he focused on gathering the star power with Satan's Eyes to replenish his </span><span>spiritual energy, which was finally stabilizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon, I'll be able to perform interdimensional travel again, but even if I escape temporarily, I need to heal my back injury or risk being caught by Duke Medusa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She might have already contacted others from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> to set a trap for me. I must eliminate her to be safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were not limited to just Duke Medusa at Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were other powerful dukes, including werewolf, Titan, Tauren, and Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was extremely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been entangled with Duke Medusa for too long, Osborne worried she had summoned reinforcements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to heal my wound quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he missed Clarissa very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's divine healing could save even those on the brink of death. If she were here, she could easily heal the injury on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's eyes lit up and he thought of Aria Rosenthal, the sixth-ranked Godson of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once used a unique light elemental power, the Detoxify, during her battle with Emma.</span></p></div>
