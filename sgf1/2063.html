        <h1>Chapter 2054 Elf Water-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, he felt ten Celestial Crystals was a steal for this cup of Elf Water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he downed the rest of the Elf Water in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda asked eagerly, "How does it taste? How do you feel? Elf Water purifies the body, flushing out impurities and boosting physical strength. It's quite effective!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, her brow furrowing, "Hmm? You don't seem to be reacting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Usually, the first time someone drinks Elf Water, the effects are most pronounced. They end up releasing a lot of impurities! But you... nothing at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is my Elf Water no longer effective?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or is your Divine Body so powerful that you simply don't have any impurities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda looked at him with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. His body had surpassed the limits of a Level Ten Divine Body, reaching the Infinite Sacred Body stage, which meant he was already pure and free of impurities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elf Water, while potent, wasn't enough to change that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to steer the conversation in a different direction. "Thanks for the Elf Water, Alfreda! It was delicious! My name's Osborne Augustine. Now, could you tell me why there aren't any other guests around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He studied her, sensing that Alfreda was far friendlier than any of the other elves he'd encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being around her put him at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda sighed again at his question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason I don't have any guests is because I'm part of the Nature Elf Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the second time he had heard her mention her clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does being part of the Nature Elf Clan have to do with the lack of guests?" he wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could ask, Alfreda continued, "Since this is your first visit to Elf City, you probably don't know much about it, do you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elf City was founded by the ancient elven ancestor over a hundred thousand years ago. Over time, more and more elves have come here to settle and grow. Today, there are nine different clans living in Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's the Fire Elf Clan, Ocean Elf Clan, Sylvan Elf Clan, Thunder Elf Clan, Storm Elf Clan, Light Elf Clan, Shadow Elf Clan, and then the Life Elf Clan and Nature Elf Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each clan varies in numbers and strength, and their status in Elf City differs as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The most powerful are the Shadow Elf Clan and the Light Elf Clan. They have a moderate number of members but are incredibly strong! The king of the Shadow Elf Clan is currently the lord of Elf City, while the king of the Light Elf Clan is the pope of the Ethereal Elven Temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of their might, the Shadow Elf Clan and Light Elf Clan are the ones you definitely don't want to cross. Thankfully, they tend to be aloof and don't meddle in outside affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just below them in power are the Sylvan Elf Clan, Thunder Elf Clan, Fire Elf Clan, and Ocean Elf Clan. They have large populations and considerable influence. While their royal families differ in strength, the gap isn't that wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The weakest clans in Elf City are the Life Elf Clan and the Nature Elf Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because both clans are quite rare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Life Elf Clan is a bit better off; they excel in healing magic, so even though they aren't particularly strong, they hold a high status. Even the Shadow Elf Clan and Light Elf Clan have to treat them with caution, not daring to offend them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, in the perilous deep space, no one can guarantee they won't get hurt! And when injuries do occur, they can be severe&mdash;sometimes even a Miracle Elixir won't suffice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that happens, you either need to rely on a Sacred Elixir or turn to the Life Elf Clan for help! But Sacred Elixirs are incredibly rare and precious; who can afford to use them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why the Life Elf Clan enjoys such a high standing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for us in the Nature Elf Clan..."</span></p></div>
