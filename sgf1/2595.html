        <h1>Chapter 2485 Adriana's Third Invitation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stood frozen at this moment, feeling as if he were </span><span>stripped bare</span><span> before Adriana, </span><span>every secret of his</span><span> completely </span><span>laid bare</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, it was merely an illusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana quickly looked away, handed the four Sacred Artifacts back to Osborne, and said calmly, "In my opinion, the favor you owe me is worth more than these four Sacred Artifacts. Just </span><span>keep them</span><span>. </span><span>Aside from t</span><span>he three Legendary Sacred Artifacts, if you can make good use of this Supreme Sacred Artifact, it will greatly enhance your strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but eventually took them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Adriana </span><span>had no shortage of</span><span> Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With her strength, if she lacked such treasures, she could easily seize them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at the fist-sized, stamp-shaped Supreme Sacred Artifact and couldn't help but ask, "Will this Supreme Sacred Artifact greatly enhance my strength? What exactly does it do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>You h</span><span>ave</span><span> </span><span>already experienced it yourself</span><span>.</span><span>" Adriana replied calmly, "It's called the Invictus Seal, an auxiliary-type Sacred Artifact. It can unleash immense power, sealing off an area to form the so-called Invictus Field. With Aaron's strength, even I would struggle to break out from within."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I could easily break the Invictus Field because I was </span><span>on the </span><span>outside. It's always easier to destroy it from the outside. However, with your current strength, it's hard to fully activate the Invictus Seal, let alone unleash its full power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can infuse power into you," Adriana continued, "You just need to channel my strength to unleash the Invictus Field. If you encounter an opponent that's hard to handle, you can use the Invictus Field to trap them. Even a warrior at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection level would need at least half a day to break it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior would need a few minutes to break it! And that time would be enough for you to escape."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, Adriana waved her hand, instantly channeling an incredibly terrifying power into the Invictus Seal, causing it to emit a dazzling light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out that the prison barrier that had trapped him earlier was created by the Supreme Sacred Artifact, the Invictus Seal. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder he couldn't escape using spatial power, and even the sharp Warfare Scythe struggled to break it. Its defensive strength far surpassed that of the Magma Devourer by several times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Adriana infused power into the Invictus Seal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne could easily wield it now. If he faced enemies like Lionel or Aaron, he could simply use the Invictus Seal to trap them and escape with ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne, although the Invictus Seal couldn't directly enhance his strength, it greatly boosted his survival ability. </span><span>Against</span><span> formidable warriors, he now had more chances to protect himself and escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Ms. Alba! You've helped me again this time, and I owe you even more." Osborne said sincerely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled and replied, "This time, consider it a free gift from me, not added to what you owe. After all, you introduced me to a few excellent </span><span>disciples</span><span>, and I'm very pleased with the</span><span>m</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately understood that Adriana was referring to Isa, Clarissa, and Anastasia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of them, Osborne couldn't help but feel a tinge of longing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana teased, "What? Missing them already? If that's the case, come back to Fairy Moon Sect with me. Although they're in training, I can wake them up if you're willing to visit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit tempted by her words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, he still shook his head. "No need! Since they're training, I won't disturb them. There's plenty of time in the future anyway!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, he paused and continued, "However, </span><span>would you mind bringing</span><span> them some gifts for me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bring gifts?" Adriana looked at the three Legendary Sacred Artifacts in Osborne's hand and said, "You want to give these three Legendary Sacred Artifacts to them? You don't have to do that. </span><span>Once they are ready</span><span>, I'll prepare everything for them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "I know you'll prepare for them, but that's your arrangement, not mine. I also want to do something for them. Besides, these three Legendary Sacred Artifacts&mdash;the ring, the hammer, and the gauntlets&mdash;aren't suitable for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, give them to whoever you think suits them best! Also..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out two more Sacred Artifacts, one being the Ice Scepter, and the other Lionel's Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ice Scepter is a Legendary Sacred Artifact, while the Void Sword is a Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the Void Sword, even Adriana was a bit surprised. "You're giving these to them too?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Then I'll </span><span>leave them to you</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled faintly. "The Ice Scepter is acceptable since it's just a Legendary Sacred Artifact. But this sword is no ordinary one. It comes with the ability to traverse time and space, making it a premium among Legendary Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you sure you don't want to keep it for yourself? You're really giving it to them?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded. "I have Spatial Power. The sword's traversal ability is useless to me. Besides, I don't like using swords."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then I'll hand it over to Isa!" Adriana explained, "It's not because Isa is the closest to me that I'm </span><span>doing this</span><span>, but because she's indeed the most suitable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, right now only Isa can wield this Supreme Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned after hearing that. "Isa can already wield the Supreme Sacred Artifact? What's her current cultivation level?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled and replied, "Primary Empyrean Sacredness! But I guess by the time she finishes this cultivation, she'll already be at Mid Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seems like it's only been a little over half a year, and Isa has already reached Primary Empyrean Sacredness, about to break through to Mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">When she left with Ms. Alba back then, her cultivation level was lower than mine, but now she's about to surpass me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Her progress is incredibly fast!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the benefit of having a powerful master?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had to admit that he was indeed a bit envious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled and said, "It's not too late to regret now. If you take me as your master, I guarantee you'll reach Mid Empyrean Sacredness in half a year. Within a few years, you'll achieve Advanced Empyrean Sacredness. In a few decades, you can reach Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, or even Great Perfection..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne </span><span>could feel the temptation in her voice</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He calmed down and said, "Thank you for your kindness, but I'm afraid I have to disappoint you again. I won't take a master. I think cultivating on my own is pretty good. Although it's a bit slower, it's more solid."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana looked at Osborne and finally shook her head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Alright. This is the third time I've invited you, yet you've still refused. If I insist any further, I'</span><span>d</span><span> </span><span>make a fool of myself</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, </span><span>If you had taken me</span><span> as your master and </span><span>broken</span><span> through to Empyrean Sacredness so quickly</span><span>, it</span><span> might </span><span>not</span><span> be a good thing for you. </span><span>In that case, </span><span>I definitely wouldn't let you participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, and you might miss out on this opportunity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Adriana in surprise after hearing this. "The opportunity of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?"</span></p></div>
