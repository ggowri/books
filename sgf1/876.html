        <h1>Chapter 876 The Excited First Challenger</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the jeers and mockery echoed around the arena, the members of the Augustine family found themselves caught in a whirlwind of emotions. Some were seething with anger, while others felt a deep sense of embarrassment, wishing they could just disappear into the ground.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They all blamed Osborne for the humiliation they were facing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne, unfazed by the ridicule, remained calm. He knew that soon enough, those same voices would be silenced, and their laughter would turn to disbelief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a steady voice, he addressed the crowd, "Thank you all for coming to my Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's skip the formalities! I declare my Honor Quest Ceremony officially open! Anyone who wishes to challenge me can come up to the stage now.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"On this platform, there are no rules of life or death&mdash;only victory and defeat!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you can defeat me, regardless of how you do it, you'll win a divine artifact and a staggering reward of 500 billion!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's get this started!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne finished speaking, a wave of excitement surged through the crowd, and dozens of figures leaped to their feet, eager to make their move.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll take you on!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Me first!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The frenzy of challengers surged, all believing Osborne's strength to be minimal and each eager to seize the chance for glory and wealth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, such an opportunity&mdash;defeating Osborne and claiming a divine artifact along with 500 billion&mdash;was too tempting to pass up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, over a hundred people were eager to be the first to challenge Osborne, worried that if they didn't seize the opportunity quickly, he might be defeated before it was their turn to step up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the midst of the chaos, one figure darted ahead, racing to the stage with remarkable speed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne caught sight of the challenger, a faint smile appeared on his face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a familiar face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay, ranked third in Yalynch and second among the young generation of the Rosenthal family, had been striving to break into the Godson Rankings but had fallen short time and again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, he stood proudly on the stage, a smug expression plastered across his face. Osborne's amusement faded quickly, replaced by a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay was Everett's grandson!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just five days earlier, Everett and Rumen from the Thornberry family had come together to pressure the Augustine family on behalf of the League of Divine Descent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had coerced Wesson, the family steward, into surrendering seventy percent of the Draco Group's rare metal profits to the League.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they refused, the League threatened to aid the Aberrants in annihilating the Augustine family and the Draco Group.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To Osborne, the League of Divine Descent was a formidable enemy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, Clay was the first to challenge him?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A chilling smile crept onto Osborne's face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay, meanwhile, was grinning from ear to ear. He locked eyes with Osborne, his expression dripping with disdain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said, "Ha! Luckily for me, I failed my attempt to climb the Godson Rankings yesterday.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, I wouldn't have this chance to be the first to challenge you! Just think&mdash;if I beat you, I'll walk away with a divine artifact and a cool 500 billion!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everything here belongs to me, Clay!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His excitement was palpable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead of launching an immediate attack, Clay turned to Wesson, who sat high above watching the proceedings. "Before we get started, I'd like to ask the Augustine family what divine artifact you've prepared as a prize. Aren't you going to show it off?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you dared to host this Honor Quest Ceremony, I hope you're not stingy. Surely, you have something more impressive than an Ordinary divine artifact, right?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Or would that be too embarrassing?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's patience wore thin, and he let out a sharp huff. "Rest assured, the Augustine family wouldn't hold back when hosting an Honor Quest Ceremony! If you want to see the prize, then let's show you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a swift motion, Wesson clapped his hands.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several members of the Augustine family hurried to bring forth the prize.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson declared, "This is the Axe of Strength!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Behold, one of the three axes of the River God Hermes&mdash;the Axe of Strength! This is a Premium divine artifact! Offering it as a prize should be more than enough, right?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A wave of astonishment swept through the crowd.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They hadn't expected the Augustine family to actually present a Premium divine artifact as a reward.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay was equally taken aback, but his eyes sparkled with excitement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fantastic! They really went all out for this! Hahaha! That axe is as good as mine!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a sly grin, Clay locked his gaze on Osborne. "I'm the first challenger here.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I manage to take you down, you'll make history as the first host of an Honor Quest Ceremony to leave without a win!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you ready to be defeated?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A number of onlookers below the stage eyed him with envy and jealousy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! If I had known the Augustine family would offer a Premium divine artifact, I would've been quicker!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clay got the jump on us!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, he failed to break into the Godson Rankings, but he's still strong enough to possibly walk away with that Axe of Strength!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We've come all this way for nothing. What a shame."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay reveled in the crowd's chatter. "Let's get started! Are you ready to turn your Honor Quest Ceremony into a spectacle of shame?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne remained composed. "Cut the chatter. Just make your move."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, here I come!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Clay launched his attack.</p></div>
