        <h1>Chapter 2346 Calamity-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha thought, "Am I going to die? Maybe it's a good thing that my Dark Phoenix Bloodline hasn't awakened. At least, the elders of the Ember Phoenix Clan won't die because of me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She bit her lower lip, </span><span>a pang of regret washing over her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, she shook her head. What these people trying to kill her truly wanted to destroy was the hope of the entire Ember Phoenix Clan. Even if she hadn't awakened the Dark Phoenix Bloodline, as long as the Ember Phoenix Clan grew slightly stronger, they would still be suppressed by them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her appearance merely brought these people out earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's eyes were filled with unwillingness. She thought, "It's a pity I'm too weak. If I were strong enough, I would definitely kill these people."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had never craved power as much as she did at this moment. But power doesn't appear out of thin air; she was merely a weakling who wasn't even an Empyrean Sacredness. In a battle of warriors at this level, she could do nothing, not even resist, and could only wait silently for death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take the Dark Phoenix and leave." Suddenly, Zebulon roared, "The Dark Phoenix is not only the hope of the Ember Phoenix Clan on the Racial Convergence Planet but also the hope of the Ember Phoenix Clan in the cosmos. She absolutely cannot die. Otherwise, I won't be able to face the ancestors of the Ember Phoenix Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll hold them off. Take the Dark Phoenix and leave immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Zebulon's body began to swell, flames and light bursting out from within him. At this moment, a terrifying energy locked onto the ten top-tier warriors wearing black masks at the level of Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone shouted, "Mr. Hiram."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another person shouted angrily, "Mr. Hiram, don't!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Zebulon's current state, the elders of the Ember Phoenix Clan immediately had reddened eyes, as Zebulon was self-destructing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hiram!" Agatha's eyes also turned red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a top-tier warrior at the level of Empyrean Sacredness, Zebulon was one of the strongest warriors on Racial Convergence Planet. He was respected, held immense power, and possessed an incredibly long lifespan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to save her, he was willing to self-destruct.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used self-destruction to block those ten top warriors, just to give her a sliver of hope to survive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha felt a lump in her throat. She stared at the ten enemies with hatred in her eyes, but tears still fell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go now. I can die, but Dark Phoenix cannot. Take her away immediately. If she dies because of us, we will all be sinners of the Ember Phoenix Clan. Go!" Zebulon roared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elders of the Ember Phoenix Clan were now fewer than twenty. Their eyes were bloodshot, still ready to fight to the death. But hearing Zebulon's roar, they clenched their teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!" An elder of the Ember Phoenix Clan quickly grabbed Agatha and fled into the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other elders surrounded her protectively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to leave? Do you think you can escape? Since the Ember Phoenix Clan is so foolish, not only will Dark Phoenix die, but all of you will too." The warriors in black masks immediately launched a pursuit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All of you, come back! Phoenix Shackle!" Zebulon shouted angrily. A flaming chain suddenly emerged from within him, swiftly linking together and sealing off the entire area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The warriors' attacks struck it, but they were all repelled and unable to break through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think this can stop us? How ridiculous. Break it!" the leading warrior sneered. Immediately, an even more terrifying power emanated from him, and the burning chains shattered instantly.</span></p></div>
