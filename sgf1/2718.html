        <h1>Chapter 2589 Being Toyed With</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne took out the Warfare Scythe, Matthew was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, his face immediately darkened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he realized that Osborne's Warfare Scythe was merely a Superior Sacred Artifact, he couldn't help but laugh, his smile full of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ridiculous! If you had used that Bloodwrought Bow, with your ability to defeat Yunus in one shot, I might have been more cautious and taken this battle seriously! But you actually gave up your advantage and chose to fight me in close combat?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You&rsquo;re courting death!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You actually want to use a Superior Sacred Artifact to clash head-on with my Supreme Sacred Artifact? Aren't you afraid that your Warfare Scythe will be cut in half by my blade?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Matthew finished speaking, the crowd below began to chatter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne may be a dark horse, but he's just too arrogant! If he used his best long-range attacks, he might have a slight chance of winning! But he actually wants to engage Prince Matthew in close combat?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When it comes to close combat, even Princess Seraphina is no match for Prince Matthew! He must keep Prince Matthew at a distance to stand a chance of winning!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne abandoning his own advantage and choosing close combat is pure suicide! Plus, the gap between their Sacred Artifacts is too big! Osborne is using only a Supreme Sacred Artifact, while Prince Matthew wields a Superior Sacred Artifact. In close combat, the level of the Sacred Artifact is crucial&mdash;otherwise, after one or two clashes, it could crack or even shatter completely, guaranteeing defeat!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne is doomed to lose!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That dark horse has no chance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, no one had faith in Osborne, especially those familiar with him. They knew Osborne's close combat skills were poor because back in Zephyr State, Osborne once fought against Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That time, Osborne was brutally suppressed by Agatha in close combat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for his spatial power, he would have lost already.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Matthew's strength was far superior to Agatha's at the time, completely on a different level. They all believed Osborne was bound to lose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fight begins!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Zorro announced the start of the fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Osborne didn't use the Bloodwrought Bow, Matthew didn't rush in immediately. Instead, he moved his steps, slowly approaching Osborne while taunting him along the way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I advise you to surrender now! That way, you'll suffer less pain! After all, everyone knows the risks of close combat. If I accidentally kill you, that would be such a pity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Surrender is your only way out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "You're really noisy! If you have the ability to kill me, then go ahead! I don't think you have what it takes!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne suddenly vanished from where he stood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He activated his spatial power!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next instant, Osborne appeared in front of Matthew. The Warfare Scythe in his hand slashed fiercely at Matthew with incredible speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew reacted swiftly, dodging Osborne's attack. Then, with even greater speed, he drove the Crimson Dagger in his hand fiercely toward Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Compete with me in speed? You're not qualified!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that so?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. He swiftly dodged Matthew's attack. His speed became even faster as his Warfare Scythe suddenly changed direction and thrust toward Matthew's chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew's expression changed instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne easily dodge his attack instantly made Matthew feel that his strength seemed quite formidable. He realized that Osborne's speed and reactions were no worse than his own!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who said this kid isn't good at close combat?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew was a bit angry at this moment. He thought to himself, "So what if he's good at close combat? At the same cultivation level, my close combat skills are unbeatable. No one can defeat me in close combat!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew swiftly dodged Osborne's attack and appeared behind him. He fiercely thrust the Crimson Dagger toward Osborne's back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, he missed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne vanished in front of him. At the same time, he felt a terrifying force coming from behind, and he quickly dodged again, appearing at Osborne's side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was about to counterattack but found that Osborne had disappeared again, with a dangerous aura coming from his side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only dodge again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew felt utterly shocked at this moment. All he could do was dodge, without even a chance to strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He realized that Osborne's speed and reflexes were actually faster than his. He couldn't even touch Osborne's clothes, while Osborne's attacks made him feel increasingly endangered, as if a slight delay in dodging would result in being hit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, from the audience's perspective, the two of them were constantly flickering on the stage, unable to hit each other or gain the upper hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if they looked closely, they would realize that Matthew was completely being forced to dodge by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew's Supreme Sacred Artifact, the Crimson Dagger, had no chance to be used at this moment. Meanwhile, Osborne's Warfare Scythe, though missing Matthew with each swing, was getting closer and closer, as if Matthew wouldn't be able to dodge the next one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation instantly left the spectators dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prince Matthew is actually at a disadvantage!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this possible? In close combat, Prince Matthew is actually at a disadvantage? His opponent is merely an ordinary person at the same cultivation level as him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prince Matthew has defeated numerous advanced Empyrean Sacredness-level experts in close combat before! And now he's at a disadvantage?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who said Osborne isn't good at close combat?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who said Osborne only knows how to use a bow and arrow for long-range attacks?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He seems to be very good at close combat!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, countless faces showed shock as they watched Osborne and Matthew's battle on the stage, feeling dizzy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew desperately dodged but could never escape Osborne's pursuit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At first, Matthew wanted to attack Osborne, but now he just wants to distance himself from Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he can't!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was completely overpowered by Osborne, which made him incredibly angry. The confidence he had built up over years of close combat was shattered at this moment!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Osborne, he looked calm at this moment, his expression as relaxed as if he were playing a game.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, close combat was indeed his weakness, but ever since he acquired the Warfare Scythe and created the Warfare Blade Technique, that weakness had long disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, he took the Legendary Dragon Elixir and Perfect Dragon Elixir, entered a special Enlightenment State, and incidentally refined his self-created Warfare Scythe to make it even more perfect and better suited for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's even more impressive is that his Warfare Scythe can be used in conjunction with spatial power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is now incredibly confident; in close combat, he's no worse than anyone. Anyone daring to challenge him in close combat is simply courting death!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They think he only uses the Bloodwrought Bow for long-range attacks? That's just because he finds it more convenient!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he wanted, he could easily defeat Matthew in close combat!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He's just deliberately toying with Matthew, wanting him to taste despair a bit more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne feels this game is almost over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, his movements and attack speed suddenly increased again, as swift as lightning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, his Warfare Scythe tore through Matthew's defense. Blood immediately gushed out from Matthew.</span></p></div>
