        <h1>Chapter 2261 Advancement-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's victory was marked by yet another arrow fired with precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One arrow! Another victory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Quincy tried to get around the rules by using his massive battle blade as a shield, he still couldn't hold up against Osborne's non-stop onslaught and was quickly taken down by a single arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marreese and Tyson, watching from the sidelines, exchanged grave looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that was some serious firepower on display!" Marreese exclaimed, clearly caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For sure, a formidable opponent! Guess Mystic Sirius Sect isn't as washed-up as people say! But if you </span><span>wanna</span><span> make it into the top five, you'll have to get past us first!" Tyson chimed in, his competitive juices flowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, though, didn't give them a second glance. He simply turned around and walked away, leaving them to chew over their thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the third day of the group matches came to an end, and the top sixteen players were decided. It was no shocker that all nine seeded players had sailed through without a hiccup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the remaining seven contenders, four were from Azure Haven Academy, two from Fantasia Isle, and one from a Third-rate Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All in all, the sixteen finalists consisted of seven from Azure Haven Academy, five from Fantasia Isle, three from Mystic Sirius Sect, and one from the Third-rate Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that Azure Haven Academy was still in top-notch form, and Fantasia Isle had lived up to expectations. In contrast, Mystic Sirius Sect was lingering at the bottom of the rankings, a glaring sign of its decline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation made Angela and Danilo, look a bit on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela tried to convince herself, "It's only the group stage. Maybe there'll be some game-changers in the round of sixteen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she thought of Osborne, a glimmer of hope ignited within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Mystic Sirius Sect had the smallest contingent among the Second-rate Powers, if Osborne could snatch the championship, no one would dare to write off the sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the title of champion was the ultimate bragging right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Game-changers?" Danilo shook his head and let out a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't as starry-eyed as Angela.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just praying those three can make it into the top ten. In the last city duel, we had three in the top ten. I'd be gutted if we do worse this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela kept her silence, her mind preoccupied with the upcoming matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the group stage was finally over, the sixteen most powerful contestants were on the verge of engaging in thrilling battles. The top ten would earn the privilege of representing Tempest Fortress City in the state duel </span><span>across</span><span> the whole Zephyr State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the anticipation reached a fever pitch, each of the sixteen competitors was champing at the bit to showcase their mettle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience was abuzz with excitement, passionately debating the matches they had just watched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy's a shoo-in for the championship! I'm sticking to that! Sure, her opponents might have been weak, but she's been knocking them out in one fell swoop every time&mdash;she's in a league of her own!" one spectator asserted with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't underestimate Marreese, though! Just like last time, no one can withstand even a single strike from his blade! His attacks are brutal; if you get hit, it's all over!" another spectator retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Tyson's no pushover either! You can tell he's hungry for revenge after coming in second last time! He's got his eyes set on Marreese. I wouldn't be shocked if they go head-to-head again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I actually reckon Clara from Fantasia Isle is the biggest wild card! Her divine artifact, that iron chain, is a nightmare! She's had every opponent in a stranglehold so far&mdash;nobody can move an inch against her, and they end up throwing in the towel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, give me a break! Let's not overlook Osborne from Mystic Sirius Sect! His archery skills are off the charts! His arrows seem to teleport, and they pack such a punch that if you can't dodge, </span><span>you're</span><span> toast! He took out his last three opponents with a single arrow each&mdash;just like it's nothing!" someone else exclaimed excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Whether it's Marreese, Tyson, Clara, or Osborne, they're all just vying for second place! The championship is as good as Leroy's!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For sure! Leroy is invincible!"</span><span> </span></p></div>
