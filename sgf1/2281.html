        <h1>Chapter 2242 The Disheartened Angela-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the hundred-fold time acceleration, Osborne had spent over four years in secluded cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this grueling period, he finally managed to advance his cultivation from the Ascension Seven to the Ascension Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His command of the dark, space, and lightning elemental essences had also made remarkable headway. He'd moved from the mid-level of Level Ten to the late-level, just one step shy of reaching the peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he'd infused several hundred Azure Ores into the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow until it couldn't absorb any more of their energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could clearly sense the change; the bow had grown more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it hadn't yet evolved into a Sacred Artifact, it was incredibly close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe the next infusion would trigger that long-awaited transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, he'd delved deeper into the Divine Ascendance Techniques he'd mastered. He'd dissected them and incorporated them into his archery skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Techniques such as Spatial Oblivion Slash, Dimensional Maw, Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes, Multi-Thunder </span><span>Chainstorm</span><span>, and Tempestuous Celestial Bolt Descent, along with Soul Spark Oblivion and the Nether Soul-seizing Slash, were now smoothly integrated into his archery. He could effortlessly unleash them using the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, deftly channeling Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of confidence; his strength had grown tremendously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to face Lord Malevolence now, he was certain he could take Lord Malevolence down with a single arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the formidable Malevolence Tower, a top-tier Apex divine artifact protecting Lord Malevolence, wouldn't stand a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nowadays, the power of just one of his casual arrows was enough to defeat an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Too bad I still haven't managed to break through the absolute fusion of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! The Fusion Vessel has grown larger, but it still only has two fusion bases, limiting my ability to merge more power and enhance my Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, a hint of disappointment creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his efforts over the past four years to boost his Sacred Power, he had come up short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he sensed that the Fusion Vessel was on the verge of a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps soon, it would evolve, allowing for a third or even fourth fusion base, enabling him to merge even greater forces and strengthen his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time for the Sect Tournament!" he declared, shaking off the lingering thoughts of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stopped his training, stood up, and stretched, his joints cracking like firecrackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he stepped out of his quarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Maddox was pacing anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, relief flooding his features, "Osborne, you're finally out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't come out soon, I would have barged in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arched an eyebrow, piqued with curiosity. "What's going on? Did something happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox hurried to explain, "The Sect Tournament is about to kick off! I know how much this means to you, and I was afraid you'd miss it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle. "Don't fret. I've got the date circled! Let's head over right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne was in seclusion, the Mystic Sirius Sect had been abuzz with excitement, gearing up for the once-in-a-decade Sect Tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each tournament was a colossal affair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It determined the top ten disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect, who would then represent the sect in the city duel at Tempest Fortress City, vying for glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the Mystic Sirius Sect, the tournament also signified fierce competition among the nine peaks. The better a peak performed, the more resources it would secure, giving it the edge in recruiting the cream of the crop first.</span></p></div>
