        <h1>Chapter 2189 One Arrow-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, many of the onlookers knew that just a month ago, Osborne was merely at Ascension One. The idea of him leaping to Ascension Six in such a short span was already mind-boggling. If his supposed cultivation level were even higher, no one would give it a second thought; they'd just dismiss it as impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze turned as cold as ice, and in an instant, he released the tension on the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow shot forward like a lightning bolt, streaking through the air towards its target. This arrow was infused with Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Osborne had intended to unleash its full might against Lord Malevolence, but against Ricky, he had deliberately restrained its power by ninety percent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Ricky was only at Ascension Eight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with that much power held back, the Sacred Power arrow was far beyond what Ricky could withstand. Not only was Sacred Power inherently formidable, but the Bloodwrought Bow, reinforced with thousands of blue Azure Ores, was among the top-tier Apex divine artifacts, verging on being a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way Ricky could block this arrow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Sacred Power, a blend of spatial and dark energies, vanished as soon as it left the bowstring, entering the Dimensional Space, and reappearing right in front of Ricky in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Ricky realized that something had gone horribly wrong, it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power arrow was headed straight for his chest, zeroing in on its target with deadly precision. Ricky's eyes bulged out in sheer terror, but he didn't have a split-second to respond. The arrow struck him, and his divine power defenses, which he'd thought were impenetrable, crumbled like a house of cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were as flimsy as wet paper, easily pierced by the arrow's might. Then came the sickening sound of tearing flesh, the shattering of bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a boom, a thunderous explosion ripped through the air, turning Ricky's body into a million tiny pieces. His blood and entrails sprayed across the battlefield, painting a gruesome picture of death and destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky, the Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that very instant, every single onlooker's eyes popped out in disbelief as they witnessed Osborne wipe out Ricky with a single arrow. There was no complete piece of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky didn't even have the chance to let out a scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the deafening echoes of the explosion gradually faded away, an eerie silence descended upon the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a voice pierced through the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's my man! Isn't he just amazing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Isa, still under the thrall of Lord Malevolence. Her face was alight with pride, as if she were the one who had just pulled off that spectacular feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence stayed quiet, his expression growing gloomier as he watched Ricky's body disintegrate in a shower of gore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were glued to the Bloodwrought Bow in Osborne's hands, filled with a greedy and covetous look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's one of the most exquisite Apex divine artifacts in the entire cosmos!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's practically a quasi-Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With a quasi-Sacred Artifact like that, taking down an Ascension Eight warrior is a piece of cake! But even with that powerful bow, he's no match for me!" Lord Malevolence mumbled to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blew Ricky to pieces with an arrow. Lord Malevolence didn't think it was because of Osborne's own strength. Instead, he believed it was solely due to the extraordinary power of the Bloodwrought Bow in Osborne's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa caught his mumblings and couldn't suppress a little snicker. She found it amusing, perhaps at the irony or the absurdity of his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just at that moment, the crowd went wild. Shouts, gasps, and exclamations filled the air as the onlookers reacted to the astonishing turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good heavens! Ricky's gone! Did Osborne really blast him to bits with just one arrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this for real? Am I seeing things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is spine-chilling! How on earth did Osborne get so powerful in just a month? Ricky was an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King, and now Osborne can take him out in one shot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not his own strength! It's all thanks to that bow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bow is insanely powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're absolutely right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was abuzz with a mix of excitement and disbelief. But Osborne didn't give them a second thought. He shifted his cold, steely gaze back to Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence, release Isa this instant, and let's have a fair fight!"</span></p></div>
