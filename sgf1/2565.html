        <h1>Chapter 2463 Reprimand-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy truly felt very angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian suppressed Leroy to the point where she couldn't speak. She was clearly being framed, but she couldn't explain and could only helplessly watch Ian shamelessly seize what belonged to her, so she had already cursed Ian countless times in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne stood in front of Leroy and shielded her from Ian's oppression, allowing her to finally explain, she almost instantly started cursing without a second thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, after she finished cursing, she realized what she had done. Her face instantly turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Did she curse Ian?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian is a member of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's royal family, a three-star general, and considered a high-ranking figure in the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, Leroy is merely a disciple of the Second-rate Power, Azure Haven Academy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the entire Azure Haven Academy, and even with the combined forces of the Eight Great Academies, no one dares to offend Ian; otherwise, they would face catastrophic consequences.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, Leroy still cursed Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She cursed Ian like this in front of so many contestants. How furious would Ian be?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, it was incredibly quiet around. Everyone stared at Leroy in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air seemed about to freeze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone could see Ian quickly becoming extremely cold and stern, exuding intense killing intent that sent shivers down Leroy's spine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy is doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No one can save her now! No matter why she did it, she insulted General Ian Augustine. She's finished!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"General Ian Augustine is, after all, a member of the royal family. Even if he's just part of the branch bloodline, no one can insult him lightly. Even the rulers of first-rate powers wouldn't dare offend him easily..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare a disciple from a Second-rate Power insult him? Not only is Leroy doomed, but her sect, her family, and her friends will all be ruined because of her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Idiot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Listening to everyone's discussion, Leroy's face instantly turned pale, and her body even trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt very scared!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was afraid she would implicate Azure Haven Academy and her family and friends. Feeling Ian's terrifying killing intent, she felt weak and powerless. She had caused trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at that moment, Osborne suddenly turned around and grabbed Leroy's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne's voice appeared in her mind. "Leroy, don't be afraid! It's okay, Ian does deserve to be scolded! Don't worry. I'll protect you, you won't face Ian's revenge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's body trembled as she looked at Osborne in disbelief. Why did Osborne dare to say such things?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Somehow, looking into Osborne's eyes, Leroy suddenly calmed down, as if there was a reassuring power in his gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She bit her lip and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finally turned around and looked at Ian, whose face was full of ferocity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Ian said, "Leroy, how dare you? You insulted a royal member. You deserve death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, everyone was in an uproar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Here it comes! Ian finally exploded! He could kill Leroy in ten thousand ways, but he just chose to pin her with the charge of 'insulting a royal member'!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy is doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if someone powerful is backing her, it's useless now. She's doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people looked at Leroy with disdain, as if they were looking at a dead person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's body started trembling again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Osborne's back, she bit her lip tightly without saying a word. She believed that since Osborne said he would protect her, he would definitely do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't need to do anything, just wait for Osborne to handle everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne finally broke his silence.</span></p></div>
