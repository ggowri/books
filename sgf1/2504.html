        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is that?" Osborne saw the golden light flashing in Brenda's eyes and suddenly felt like he was being watched, as if Brenda had already discovered him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! This woman also has a special eye technique. Her eyes can emit golden light. What kind of eye technique is this? Did she see us?" Osborne frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want anyone to know he had been to the Magma Devourer's lair, nor did he want anyone to know that he had taken the treasures from the lair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, greedy warriors would surely ambush him and steal his gains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her eyes can emit golden light?" Primordial thought for a moment and said, "It might be the Golden Dragon Eye. However, the Golden Dragon Eye doesn't have X-ray vision capability. In fact, eye techniques with X-ray vision are extremely rare. At most, she can sense our energy fluctuations but can't clearly see our appearance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's</span><span> words made Osborne feel a bit relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>However</span><span>..." Primordial continued, "just in case, I suggest you kill her directly. Only the dead can keep secrets. Although you took the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branch, you must have left some traces. If she saw it and let others know you obtained a large amount of Primordial Phoenix Sycamore, you'd be in big trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face </span><span>darkened</span><span>. "Should I kill her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, Osborne said, "Forget it. Let's observe the situation first. This woman isn't simple. For her to come here alone, she must have many ways to save her life. I&rsquo;m confident I can defeat her. But if she escapes, it&rsquo;ll cause even bigger trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial said no more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda pushed the Golden Dragon Eye to its limit and sensed a powerful energy fluctuation deep within the magma pool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She immediately became excited, thinking, "There really is something in the magma pool. This might be a treasure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Brenda frowned again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could feel the terror of this magma pool. Its temperature was already frighteningly high, so she wasn&rsquo;t sure if she could withstand such extreme heat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, it was already impressive that she made it here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was thanks to her fire-resistant Sacred Artifact. Otherwise, relying solely on her strength, she might have been scorched by the boiling magma before even reaching the Magma Devourer's lair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Should I take the risk and go down to check? Just try it!" In the end, Brenda decided to give it a shot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she had come all this way, only to find she was late. If she didn&rsquo;t find anything worthwhile, she would feel very unwilling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Brenda activated a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Artifact instantly emitted a blue glow, shielding her. Brenda added a few more layers of defense and then jumped into the magma pool below.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That woman came down," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn&rsquo;t hear Brenda&rsquo;s muttering, only see her actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, seeing Brenda come down, he felt relieved instead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "She probably didn&rsquo;t see us. Otherwise, she definitely wouldn&rsquo;t dare to come down. After all, if she could see me enduring the scorching heat of the magma here, she would surely realize that my strength couldn&rsquo;t be weaker than hers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, her risking to come down to find me would be courting death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But she must have noticed the energy fluctuations around me. After all, to withstand the heat here, I couldn&rsquo;t fully conceal my power, so her Golden Dragon Eye picked up on it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She might have mistaken me for some kind of treasure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly figured out the whole situation, then hesitated a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Should I kill Brenda to ensure she keeps the secret forever, or should I keep diving deeper into the magma pool until Brenda gives up from the unbearable heat?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne decided to keep diving deeper into the magma pool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could see that Brenda was already struggling to withstand the intense heat of the magma pool, barely holding on with the combined power of multiple Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, as long as he kept diving deeper into the magma pool, Brenda would be unable to endure it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If possible, Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to kill anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he had no grudge against Brenda. Brenda was even a member of the </span><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion, which was as renowned as the Fairy Moon Sect. </span><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion had many top-tier warriors. If they found out he killed Brenda, he&rsquo;d be in big trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he just needed to avoid her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued diving deeper into the magma pool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The heat here was terrifying. If Osborne hadn&rsquo;t ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame, he absolutely couldn&rsquo;t endure it. Even an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior couldn&rsquo;t withstand the heat here relying solely on Sacred Power for protection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This showed that Brenda was very powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was still following behind Osborne at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That energy fluctuation is moving. It seems to be sinking. What is it? Could it be a living being?" Brenda thought, frowning deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using the Golden Dragon Eye, she could see a mass of energy rapidly sinking deeper into the magma pool. It moved so fast that it quickly went beyond the Golden Dragon Eye's visual range.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda was already struggling to withstand the intense heat of the magma pool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Maybe I really have no fate with the treasure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda had to stop because she knew with her strength, continuing deeper into the magma pool made it uncertain whether she could obtain the "treasure" that could move, but she would definitely die in the magma pool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hesitating for a while, she decided to give up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she began to ascend, ready to leave the magma pool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne also stopped. "That woman really gave up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Brenda leave, he breathed a sigh of relief, thinking, "Once she&rsquo;s gone, I need to leave quickly too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer had already started fighting with Mr. Norton. But Mr. Norton was clearly no match for Magma Devourer. He </span><span>had teamed up</span><span> with over a hundred judges at advanced Empyrean Sacredness level to battle Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their battlefield had already moved far from the volcanic area. This might be Mr. Norton's strategy. Magma Devourer was stronger in the volcanic region. Only by moving away from it would they have a chance to defeat Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once they injure Magma Devourer, I'll start taking action."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne decided to wait a little longer. Once Brenda left the nest, he would immediately head out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> voice sounded. "Osborne, I sense an unusual aura deep within the magma pool."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Osborne looked at Primordial in surprise. "Are you sure? Could there be more treasures deeper in the magma pool?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe, but maybe not. I sense a faint trace of life," Primordial frowned. "There seems to be a creature deep within the magma pool. However, the life aura is quite weak, so I'm not sure what it is."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I suggest you go down and take a look. Anything that can survive in such a scorching lava pool and still maintain a life aura is definitely extraordinary."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, then nodded and said, "Alright, I'll go take a look."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, Brenda hadn't left yet. Osborne decided to keep diving deeper into the magma pool to see what was below.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he dove hundreds of miles deeper into the magma pool, almost reaching the depths of Abyssal Planet's core.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, even Osborne could clearly sense the faint life aura deep within the magma pool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "What exactly is this?"</span></p></div>
