        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, letting the suspense build. "But you'll find out soon enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave them all a pointed look. "I can tell you this much. This border challenge isn't a one-day event. It'll go on until either the Human Community or the Dark Deity Legion decide they no longer want to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fact that Hudson's strong fighters aren't participating today doesn't mean they won't be in the future. The absence of Hudson family members on today's list is due to my own considerations. It has nothing to do with Mr. Hudson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, I assure you... the Hudson family would never betray the Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused again, letting the weight of her words sink in. "Lastly, let me make one thing perfectly clear... the list Mr. Hudson submitted has more names than any of your factions! It's not just the quantity; it's the quality...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Among them, Mr. Hudson himself will be participating in the Supernal Deity King Ascension Three competition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the room fell completely silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro straightened, his chest puffed out in pride. His gaze swept across the crowd, as though daring anyone to challenge him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still questioning me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still doubting the Hudson family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I submitted more geniuses than any of you, and I'm even stepping into the arena myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood tall, an air of superiority radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others felt a flush of embarrassment creeping up their necks, especially Tanner and Julian, whose faces twisted in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner paused, then gave a respectful bow. "Well, if </span><span>God of Light</span><span> says it's true, then I'll believe the Hudson family. I was too hasty before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Jethro. "Mr. Hudson, I sincerely apologize. I shouldn't have doubted your family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro felt a wave of relief wash over him, and a smug sense of satisfaction bubbled up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian snorted, clearly still unconvinced. He frowned and addressed </span><span>God of Light</span><span> again. "</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, I still don't get it! You say you were shocked by the list Hudson submitted&mdash;so why didn't you include any Hudson family members in today's competition? What's really going on here? Why can't you just tell us now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked around, as if searching for confirmation. "I'm sure many of us are as curious as I am, and I think it's best to clear the air now, so we don't end up second-guessing each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span> narrowed her eyes slightly, her patience wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really want to know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian felt a chill at her tone, but he stubbornly pressed on, bowing slightly as he spoke, "I really do want to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave him a sharp look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph. Fine. If you want to know, then I'll tell you. The list Mr. Hudson submitted contains over 20,000 names: 10,000 geniuses at the peak of the Deity Overlord level, 10,000 at the highest Deity King level, 100 at the Ascension One Supernal Deity King level, and one at the Ascension Three Supernal Deity King level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as </span><span>God of Light</span><span> finished speaking, the room fell into an eerie silence. It felt as though time itself had stopped. Everyone stood frozen, mouths agape, staring at Jethro in utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Tanner and Julian jumped to their feet, eyes wide with shock, unable to process what they'd just heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, </span><span>God of Light</span><span>'s words echoed over and over again, each one sinking in deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The list Hudson had submitted...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten thousand at the peak of Deity Overlord level? Ten thousand at the highest Deity King level? And 100 at Ascension One Supernal Deity King, plus one at Ascension Three Supernal Deity King?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is that even possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having 10,000 at the peak of Deity Overlord wasn't exactly mind-blowing. The various Dukedom-level powers here could easily boast over 10,000 in that range&mdash;though most of them were far from "genius" material. They were just ordinary cultivators who had run out of potential, stuck at the same level after years of training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But 10,000 at the highest Deity King level...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the hell was going on here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hudson's family was ranked near the bottom among Dukedom-level powers. How could they possibly have more than 10,000 at the highest Deity King level?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this some kind of joke?</span></p></div>
