        <h1>Chapter 2060 Astral Testing Arch Assessment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thunder Elf Clan Royal Family was on the lookout for talented warriors under three hundred years old, requiring a cultivation level of at least Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, with a preference for those possessing unique abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Storm Elf Clan Royal Family had slightly lower standards, accepting candidates with a minimum of Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, with a preference for those possessing unique abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fire Elf Clan set its bar at Ascension Three, while the Ocean Elf Clan also aimed for Ascension Two, with a preference for those possessing unique abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly scanned the recruitment criteria for each Elf Royal Family and felt a sinking feeling in his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized, to his dismay, that he couldn't meet any of the requirements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his cultivation level stuck at Ascension One Supernal Deity King, he didn't even come close to qualifying for the minimum standard of Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension One Supernal Deity King? Sorry, no entry here!" he muttered to himself, frustration building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reality was harsh: without even the qualification to register, participating in the assessments was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought bitterly, "This is cultivation level bullying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, I'm just Ascension One, but I could take down an Ascension Four! If I tapped into the absolute forbidden zone, I'd have no problem facing off against Ascension Five or Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can't they lower the bar just a bit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might miss out on some real super talents with these rigid standards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no options in sight, Osborne sighed, pondering how he could possibly join one of these Elf Race Royal Families' exploration teams and venture into Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do they mean by 'special abilities'? Every Royal Family has that line about preferring those with unique skills in their recruitment ads. What exactly are they looking for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stuck without a way to apply, he decided to stick around and watch the proceedings closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to see the specific assessment standards of the various royal families, hoping to spot a glimmer of opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's thought, he made his way to the Shadow Elf Clan Royal Family's area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the talented young warriors from World of Racial Convergence aimed to join the Shadow Elf Clan's exploration team first. Those who met the requirements would register there and await their assessments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they passed, it would be a cause for celebration; if not, they would then consider other Royal Families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he approached, Osborne spotted Jaden, Renata, Letitia, and the Ascension Five human warrior all queuing up to pass through a massive structure known as the Astral Testing Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arch emitted a dark gray light, scanning each individual who walked beneath it. It seemed capable of detecting a person's age, cultivation level, and primary elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the Ascension Five human warrior stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arch's voice announced, "Human Community Floyd Potter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Age test: passed! Cultivation level: Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, primary elemental power: fire elemental!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire elemental energy intensity: Class A!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Overall score: Class A!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Astral Testing Arch vibrated as it projected a holographic display of Floyd's information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, the eyes of several princes and princesses from the Shadow Elf Clan, who were seated at the top, lit up with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One prince from Shadow Elf Clan, Waylon Bolton, who was Ascension Six, wasted no time. "Floyd from Human Community, your strength is impressive! Join my exploration team! With your abilities, you're more than qualified to be part of my group. Only with me will you have the chance to delve deeper into Umbra Earth and reap greater rewards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another Ascension Six Shadow Elf Clan princess, Bernice Bolton, piped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on a second! What do you mean the only way to delve deeper into Umbra Earth is by following you, Waylon? Following me, Bernice, would do the trick just as well! You're Ascension Six, and so am I! Floyd, join my exploration team, and I'll make sure we break through Umbra Earth together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon smirked. "Bernice, you've just barely hit Ascension Six, and you think you can compete with me already? Breaking through Umbra Earth? We've explored it so many times, and we can't even get a solid foothold there. You're dreaming if you think we're going to punch through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Floyd, don't fall for her bravado! Sticking with her could be a death sentence in Umbra Earth. Join my team instead! At least with me, you'll have a better shot at finding treasures and making it back alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really, Waylon? Isn't the big brother supposed to let the little sister have a turn?" Bernice rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon chuckled, "Finding talent is tough, so of course I'm going to compete! Besides, I genuinely believe that having a prodigy like Floyd on your team is a waste. You wouldn't net any rewards in Umbra Earth anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're driving me crazy!" Bernice seethed. "Floyd, don't listen to him! If you join his team, he might just toss you aside as cannon fodder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lively bickering between the two siblings, </span><span>who were </span><span>both powerful prince and princess of the Shadow Elf Clan, had escalated into a heated argument, leaving the onlookers stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were supposed to be on the same side, yet here they were, red-faced and airing their grievances in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Floyd stood there dumbfounded, caught between the two, unsure about where to turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One warrior from the Shadow Elf Clan called out, "Prince Waylon, Princess Bernice, enough with the squabbling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you seriously going to make a spectacle of yourselves? Floyd from Human Community might be an Ascension Five powerhouse with an overall score of Class A. He's a rare gem, but let's not lose our dignity over this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're both interested in Floyd, how about we let him decide?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, both Waylon and Bernice fell silent, their gazes turning expectantly toward Floyd, their eyes holding a flicker of goodwill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief moment of hesitation, Floyd took a deep breath, bowing slightly to Waylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Prince Waylon, for your interest, but I'd prefer to join Princess Bernice's exploration team."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, disappointment washed over Waylon's face, while Bernice's expression brightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot a smug glance at her brother. "Did you see that? He's got good taste! He knows joining my team is the way to go! You can take a step back now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick wave, Bernice called out, "Floyd, come on over here! Once I gather my fifty recruits, we'll take off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Floyd nodded with a smile and quickly positioned himself behind Bernice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assessment continued. Candidates only needed to pass through the Astral Testing Arch, which would provide an evaluation of their strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a prince or princess from the Shadow Elf Clan took notice, they would naturally initiate a recruitment offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accepting meant joining that royal's squad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been watching intently from the crowd for a while. He recognized that the Shadow Elf Clan's princes and princesses primarily focused on the overall score provided by the Astral Testing Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a candidate's total score fell below Class C, they were deemed unqualified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Class C score generally prompted interest from one of the royals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the score hit Class B, multiple princes and princesses would vie for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a score hitting Class A?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a magnet for the strongest contenders like Waylon and Bernice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Jaden stepped boldly toward the Astral Testing Arch, ready to face his own assessment.</span></p></div>
