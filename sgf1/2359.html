        <h1>Chapter 2289 Tough-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that little showdown, no one else really caught Osborne's eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that all the top ten were gathered there, Osborne took a quick once-over, sized up their general strength, and then tuned out. He knew the real battle was yet to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still a huge gap in strength between them and Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson. It was like comparing a candle to the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Clara, standing beside Osborne, murmured with a solemn look in her eyes, "Wow! This is really a gathering of the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara continued, heaving a sigh, "When you think about it, making it into the top ten in the state duel is like walking through the valley of death! Compared to the state duel, our city duel in Tempest Fortress City was a piece of cake! The city duel was basically just a showdown between the top dogs of three Second-rate Powers. But the state duel... there are at least hundreds of top disciples from Second-rate Powers, not to mention the top guns from three First-rate Powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just too tough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of discouragement flashed across Clara's eyes. During the city duel, she'd been as confident as a peacock. She even thought she had a fighting chance against Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the state duel, there were a ton of people who were clearly stronger than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the worst part was, that these powerhouses could team up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How on earth could they compete with that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Clara had thought that with a bit of luck, they might just scrape into the top ten. After all, in the world of duels, anything could happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, a sense of hopelessness washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara exclaimed, "No wonder so many of the top-hundred rankers are willing to be hired guns for others. They know their odds of making it into the top ten are as slim as a reed. So, they might as well lend a hand and get some dough in return!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's lament made Osborne let out a soft chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, what's this? Are you throwing in the towel already? Deciding to give up the battle for the top ten?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara forced a wry smile. "I'm not quitting! I'm just being realistic. I'll take this as a learning experience. If I break through to Empyrean Sacredness in the next ten years and get a shot at the next state duel, I'll surely be a force to be reckoned with. I wanna shine as bright as Agatha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, a fire of determination blazed in Clara's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled encouragingly, "I'm right behind you! Your talent is no slouch compared to theirs. And of course, it'd be a dream come true if you could break through to Empyrean Sacredness in ten years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara gave a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the booming voice rang out once more. "Is everyone here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man materialized in the air right in front of the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His presence was as imposing as the ocean. When his eyes swept across the crowd, it was like an electric shock went through each of them, leaving them all tingling from head to toe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was a heavy-hitter from the Zephyr State government and the head referee of the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha, Horace, and the others at the front quickly bowed to the middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good day, Mr. Carroll!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert Carroll, the chief judge, nodded back at Agatha and the gang. Eventually, his eyes landed on Agatha and Horace, and a smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that he had high hopes for these two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't say a word about it. Instead, Rupert scanned the crowd and declared, "Those who aren't here are considered to have thrown in the towel! Now, let me introduce myself. I'm Rupert Carroll, the chief judge of this state duel. You can call me Mr. Carroll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm gonna lead you to the combat zone of the state duel. Starting tomorrow, for the next seven days, that's where you'll be hanging out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who takes off without permission will be counted as a quitter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got one day to get the lay of the land!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Rupert finished his spiel, the crowd started buzzing like a hive of bees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One guy at the front piped up and asked, "Mr. Carroll, where on earth is this state duel gonna take place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert gave a little smile and decided it was time to spill the beans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Arctic Maw Chasm!"</span></p></div>
