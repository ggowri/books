        <h1>Chapter 641 Perfectly Evolved Beings</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought quickly, "If any one of these three Class AA Medusas were alone, I </span><span>could easily take them out. But together, I can't kill them. I need to find a way to separate them, at least keep them from quickly supporting each other. How can I temporarily split them up? They know that if they spread out, I'll pick them off one by one, so they won't willingly separate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne focused on the three Medusas, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he thought, "If light and time can be distorted, can space be distorted too? I have spatial power, but my control is not very high. I can only use Spatial Tearing for dimensional travel. But maybe I can try stretching or compressing space? They're only dozens of feet apart. If I stretch the space between them, their distance will increase, and they won't be able to support each other in time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne decided to give it a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started quietly experimenting, searching for a way to stretch the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Medusas saw Osborne stop attacking, they did the same. They knew that even if they teamed up, they could only protect themselves and couldn't defeat Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Medusas looked at the others and said coldly, "If I'm not mistaken, you're Osborne, one of the Augustine family's future heirs, right? Your strength is much greater than the information we have on you. I'll give you a chance to join the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> and serve the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. That way, you'll have a chance to survive. The Augustine family is doomed to be destroyed by the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. You're just from a branch of the Augustine family. There's no need for you to be destroyed with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne continued trying to stretch the space, he replied calmly, "Join the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>? Serve the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>? I might consider it, but how do I know the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will definitely win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Medusa sneered, "Because the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> wields the power of a god. He has an endless supply of perfectly evolved beings born for war serving him. No matter how strong the Augustine family is, they will eventually be worn down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and thought, "Perfectly evolved beings born for war? I remember that Medusa No. 7 has mentioned something similar before. Are these so-called perfectly evolved beings clones?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, "Are the perfect evolved beings you're talking about like you, clones?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Medusa scoffed, "We're not clones. We're evolved beings. The great King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> has not only us but even more powerful evolved beings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious. "I once met a Medusa who claimed to be Medusa No. 7. She said you don't have names, only numbers, and that the higher the number, the stronger the Medusa. But her strength was far less than yours. What number are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Medusas exchanged glances. One of them smiled, "Medusa No. 7 is just a Class A Count Medusa. We are Class AA Marquis Medusa. Our strength is naturally much greater than hers. As for our numbers, it's fine to tell you. I am Marquis Medusa No. 61. They are Marquis Medusa No. 62 and No. 63."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned. "No. 61? There are at least 60 Class AA Marquis Medusas like </span><span>you? Marquis Medusa? Count Medusa? Do you also have Duke Medusas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marquis Medusa No. 61 smiled faintly, "Of course. Anyone at Class AAA is a Duke Medusa. They are even more perfect and thoroughly evolved than us. Besides, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> also have Werewolf Dukes, Blood Clan Dukes, Titan Dukes, and Tauren Dukes. In short, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> are far more powerful than you can imagine. Even though you're strong, opposing the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> is like using an egg to smash a rock. You will be utterly crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your only chance is to leave the Augustine family and join the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, serving the great King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. With your talent, you could still rise to a high position in the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. When the great King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> becomes the underground ruler of the </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, your status will be higher than now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marquis Medusa No. 61 kept persuading Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' power was indeed beyond his imagination. If what Medusa No. 61 said was true, the Augustine family was in serious danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, his eyes lit up as he exclaimed, "Great. It really can work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 61 smiled, "It seems you've agreed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and said, "No, I haven't agreed, and I never will. I've just finally thought of a way to deal with you, and now, you damned clones can all die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne suddenly reached out and made a stretching motion towards the space next to Medusa No. 61.</span></p></div>
