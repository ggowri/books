        <h1>Chapter 1994 Two Straight Losses-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, if you want your so-called geniuses from the Human Community to die early in the arena, I'm more than happy to oblige!" Icy One sneered, waving a hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that signal, ten thousand soldiers emerged from the ranks of the Dark Deity Legion, each one at the peak of Celestial Deity Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, from the Human Community's coalition, another ten thousand soldiers stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were grim and tense. The previous battle between the Transcendent Deity Level fighters had shown them just how brutal and savage this contest could be. Every one of the Human Community's Transcendent Deity Level geniuses had perished in that arena&mdash;none of them had made it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, as they lined up for the new fight, they couldn't help but wonder&mdash;was their fate going to be the same?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only way out was to wipe out every enemy in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of them hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't just fighting for their lives; they were fighting for the honor of the Human Community. If they showed fear, if they backed down, the respect of their people would be trampled underfoot by the Unity Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even knowing that stepping into the arena could mean their deaths, they marched forward without a second thought, climbing onto the viewing platform with steely resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stage was set. Ten thousand Celestial Deity Level geniuses from the Human Community, facing off against the same number from the Unity Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let the battle begin!" Icy One's low command rang out, and with that, the fight erupted. The blood, the carnage&mdash;everything repeated just like the last time. The numbers on the arena floor dwindled rapidly as the two sides clashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community's elites, watching from the sidelines, couldn't hide their growing unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene unfolding before them was eerily familiar&mdash;the same brutal violence, the same heartbreaking outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the Human Community geniuses fought with all the courage and ferocity they had, but in the end, it wasn't enough. They managed to take down about eight thousand of the Dark Deity Legion's fighters, but one by one, they fell, their bodies littering the viewing platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy, suffocating silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Sanctum of Light, the leaders of all the major Human Community factions were visibly shaken, their eyes bloodshot with frustration and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two straight losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hand-picked geniuses of the Human Community had fought valiantly against the Dark Deity Legion's best, only to fall short twice in a row. Every time, there had been a glimmer of hope, a sense that victory was within reach, but in the end, it was always the same&mdash;defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, your Human Community lost again!" Icy One's mocking voice echoed through the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk! Get on with it!" </span><span>God of Light</span><span>'s voice was ice-cold, but anyone who listened could feel the rage and sorrow brewing beneath her composed exterior. She was holding it in, struggling to suppress the torrent of emotions threatening to spill over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew this was part of the plan&mdash;the losses were painful, but they had a purpose. If they could just buy enough time, it would be worth it, even if it meant losing thousands of the Human Community's finest geniuses in battle, one fight at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing them fight so fiercely, knowing they were giving everything, only to end up dead on the arena floor... it cut deeper than she could express.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she was the leader of the Human Community. She was their pillar. She couldn't afford to show weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep going!" she ordered, her voice steady despite the turmoil inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up were the Deity Overlord Level fighters&mdash;ten thousand from each side. These were powerful, seasoned warriors, their strength far beyond that of the previous groups. Maybe it was the bitter taste of the earlier defeats that fueled the Human Community fighters, or maybe it was just sheer determination, but this time, the Human Community's Deity Overlord Level geniuses came out swinging with unmatched ferocity and strength.</span></p></div>
