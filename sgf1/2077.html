        <h1>Chapter 2068 Nature Kingdom</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight guards from the Fire Elf Royal Family rushed over. They had seen their princess being choked by Alfreda and mercilessly slapped. Their eyes burned with anger as they shouted at Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda glanced at them and simply ignored them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued to slap Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda knew that once she hit Monica, she would be punished. She understood that one slap meant punishment and that more slaps would only worsen her fate. So she chose to keep hitting Monica for a while longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, when she saw the guards, her actions only quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica was utterly stunned. Her head buzzed, and her once beautiful face swelled up like a pig's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore very little. Just moments ago, she had covered her vital parts with a cloth as thin as a leaf. Now, under Alfreda's brutal assault, even that scant covering failed to hide anything...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sight gave Osborne quite a show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Monica had a bad temper, her figure was undeniably superb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, if you don't stop, we will have to take action!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight guards, seeing no sign that Alfreda would cease, grew even more anxious. Their eyes were full of threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alfreda decided she had hit enough. She tossed Monica aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards quickly caught Monica and covered her exposed body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief inspection of her condition, they glared at Alfreda in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, how could you hurt Princess Monica like this? Are the Nature Elf Royal Family and the Fire Elf Royal Family about to go to war?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's face twisted into a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"War? You are nothing but a group of guards. How dare you talk about war with me? Do you really think you represent the Fire Elf Royal Family? With a statement like that, I could kill you on the spot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes flashed with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Alfreda in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never imagined that someone so petite could possess such an imposing aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guard who had spoken suddenly turned pale. He tried to explain, but no words came. He even dared not meet Alfreda's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "Princess Alfreda, this matter will not end here! I will take Princess Monica back immediately and report everything to the King of Fire Elf! Just wait and see. You will be punished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your actions are unforgivable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda shrugged dismissively. "What you do is none of my concern. Hurry back and file your complaint! If you don't scram, I'll beat all of you too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scram!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, the eight guards' expressions changed dramatically. They truly seemed afraid of being beaten by Alfreda and quickly helped Princess Monica away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their furious voices still echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just you wait! The Fire Elf Royal Family will not let this slide! Princess Alfreda, you will be severely punished! Not even the King of Nature Elf can save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, you're finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, they all ran off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda snorted disdainfully, "Hmph! As if I would be afraid. If they were so powerful, they wouldn't run away! They only know how to call in favors... I really look down on those who love to complain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A trace of dejection crossed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Osborne and said, "Osborne, I have to go back now! You... never mind. Do as you please! If I return in a few hours, we can continue our conversation. If I don't, then you must leave Elf City immediately, understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "Alfreda, are you going to be alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual wave of her hand, Alfreda smiled, "What harm can come to me? They don't dare to kill me! At worst, they will only threaten my father and force him to punish me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I reckon my father will only expel me from Elf City for a short while. It isn't a big deal! Even though our Nature Elf Royal Family has fallen on hard times, Elf City cannot function without us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I will be fine. But you...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they ultimately can't handle me, they might take it out on you! So if I haven't returned in a few hours, you must leave Elf City immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Alfreda waved her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm off! I'm going back now to turn myself in. Perhaps that will lessen the punishment. If I delay any longer, my father will catch me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda soared toward the center of Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nature Elf Royal Family, along with the other royal houses and the Ethereal Elven Temple, resided high atop the crown of the giant Elven Mother Tree in the heart of Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary people could not approach the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only members of the Elf royal families, temple members, and those they invited were allowed to ascend it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wore a solemn expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope Alfreda doesn't receive too harsh a punishment. She seems so afraid of leaving Elf City. Only here can she feel safe. If she really gets expelled from Elf City..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head and did not dwell on it further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had not known Alfreda long, he felt a deep connection with her. He had come to consider her a friend. She was his only friend among the Elf Race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not want to see Alfreda punished, but there was nothing he could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a power struggle among the Elf royal families. He was merely an outsider, a Human of only Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing he could change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must find a way to strengthen myself. Right now, I have no way to join the Elf Royal Family's exploration team and enter Umbra Earth. I will have to find another way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne returned to his wooden lodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crown of the Elven Mother Tree was enormous, almost covering half of Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Kingdom of the Nature Elf Royal Family lay atop the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a grand and imposing Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was known as Nature Kingdom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One could see hints of its former splendor. But now, the Kingdom looked somewhat dilapidated. Within its vast halls, few Elves remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda flew straight into Nature Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, I am back!" she called loudly, her clear voice echoing throughout Nature Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, a handsome man appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, why did you run back? Don't you know the wrath of the Fire Elves still burns? Father arranged for you to guard the Emerald Forest Lodge not as a punishment, but to prevent them from continuously targeting you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why have you returned now? If they discover this, they will come complaining to me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The handsome man frowned as he looked at Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded to the handsome man and then stuck out her tongue. "I've gotten myself into trouble again! I just gave Monica a severe beating! I guess she has already returned to the Fire Kingdom. Their people will be here very soon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought I should come back and confess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The handsome man was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You hit Monica again? Weren't you supposed to hold back a little?"</span></p></div>
