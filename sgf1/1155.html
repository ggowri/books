        <h1>Chapter 1154 He Can’t Be the Godfather</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle was finally over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the warriors of Eidolon City gazed at the fallen Class S Dark Exotic Beasts, a collective sigh of relief swept through them. Exhausted, they dropped to the ground, desperate for rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight had lasted over an hour, costing them at least a hundred lives, and nearly everyone bore injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the way it ended felt utterly bizarre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How had these formidable beasts, who had been wreaking havoc just moments ago, suddenly run out of power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been charging at Eidolon City's warriors with lethal intent, only to become motionless and easy targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confusion filled the air, but no one wanted to dwell on it long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they wanted was a moment to catch their breath and figure out the next steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave felt utterly drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, those Class S Dark Exotic Beasts had been a mere 40 feet away. If they hadn't suddenly "run out of juice," there was no way he could have escaped their wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their razor-sharp wings could have sliced him in half with ease!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just him but Cillian, Rihanna, Viggo, and Ariana would have met the same grim fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank the gods for saving us from the brink of hell," Dave murmured, still shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cillian and the others knew better. This wasn't divine intervention; it was Zoe, Osborne's sister, who had intervened! They had witnessed her power before in the Lostridge Mountains, and now it was clear she had done the same here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, it wasn't the gods! It was Godfather's sister who saved us! She made those Class S Dark Exotic Beasts stop thinking, and that's how we survived!" Cillian exclaimed, urgency lacing his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rihanna and the others nodded vigorously in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! It had to be Godfather's sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave stared at them, bewildered. "What are you talking about? Godfather's sister? Which Godfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian quickly pointed towards Osborne. "Dad, that's Godfather&mdash;Osborne Augustine! The two girls next to him are his sisters, Anastasia and Zoe. They came to help us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cillian, what nonsense are you spouting? How could he be Godfather? You've been duped!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather is a figure of immense power. There's no way he'd come to Eidolon City in person, especially not looking so young! I may not have met the new Godfather, but I've heard the stories. They say Osborne is a ruthless killer, a man whose very presence sends shivers down your spine! He's said to cut down top Class S foes like they're nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could he possibly be the Godfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave's disbelief was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian couldn't help but chuckle nervously. They had thought the same way before, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were just a wealthy family, far removed from the world of the Godfather. Most of what they'd heard were exaggerated tales.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, the new Godfather had to be someone who exuded an aura of fear just by being in the same room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked young, handsome, charming, and bright&mdash;none of those traits matched the image of a feared Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I swear, Osborne really is..." Cillian tried to explain, urgency creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dave waved him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! Stop right there! I'm starting to regret sending you four to Newport City to ask the Augustine family for reinforcements! You're all too young and naive, and it's clear you've been misled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll head to Newport City myself to request reinforcements! The number of Dark Exotic Beasts pouring out of the rift is increasing, and they're getting stronger. We can't hold them off much longer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The wealthy families and Ancient Families of Eidolon City are preparing to retreat! If they do, these Dark Exotic Beasts will pour out, and we'll be the first to suffer, followed by millions of ordinary citizens in Eidolon City...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, only the Augustine family from Newport City can help us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Again, he cut off Cillian's explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Representatives from all the major powers are here. Don't say anything that could mess things up for us! No more talk about 'The Godfather,' or it'll make the Carey </span><span>family look like a laughingstock," he murmured quietly, just as a group of a dozen people approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the high-ranking members of Eidolon City's wealthy families and Ancient Families&mdash;some were patriarchs, others elders, but each was formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, five were of Class S; the rest were at least Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those five Class S came from five of Eidolon City's Ancient Families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was Finn Reinhart, the patriarch of the city's most powerful ancient clan, the Reinhart family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn glared at Dave, his expression cold. "Dave, you've seen how dire the situation is. We can't hold out much longer. You said you'd call for reinforcements from the Augustine family in Newport City&mdash;where are they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they don't arrive soon, we're pulling out. We're not dying here. You can handle this mess yourself, Carey family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave's anxiety spiked.</span></p></div>
