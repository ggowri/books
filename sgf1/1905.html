        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What incredible power!" Anastasia exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with excitement as she gazed at the colossal electric serpent connecting heaven and earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, only she possessed the Thunder Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her talent with Thunder Power was so remarkable it inspired envy. Even Anastasia admitted the power of the technique, which left the others utterly astonished, their eyes gleaming with awe as they watched the electric serpent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this attack seems a bit one-dimensional, doesn't it? If the speed is fast enough, it should be easy to dodge!" Bryce chimed in, skepticism creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia shot him a look. "Hold your horses! This is definitely not the full extent of a Divine Ascendance Technique! Osborne is intentionally holding back to avoid hurting us! Just wait until he masters this electric serpent. It'll unleash even more power! Just wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group fell silent, their eyes glued to the spectacle. Even Sebastian, Divine Shadow, and God of Star stood in admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow murmured, "These young folks today are something else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Mila's parents didn't wield such a powerful Divine Ascendance Technique at Osborne's level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took Sebastian's hand, a wistful smile on her face. "We're getting old! Let the younger generation handle the fighting while we enjoy life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian chuckled and nodded in agreement. "You're absolutely right! We can just sit back and let them protect us. After all, he's my grandson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Divine Shadow with a grin. "With a talent like his, he must have inherited my genes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe we should think about having another one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow shot him a playful glare. "Have another? At our age?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed slightly, betraying a hint of intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star watched them with a mix of amusement and exasperation. "Can you two tone it down a bit? I'm starting to feel like a third wheel here! It's driving me crazy being the only single one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian and Divine Shadow exchanged knowing smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you be lonely when Darren's been chasing after you? He comes looking for you right after training! You should at least give him a chance!" Sebastian teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star's face turned crimson. "But that guy... he's..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow interjected, "You mean Darren is from the Blood Clan? Not a normal person?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if he is? The Blood Clan is just as normal as we are, apart from their loyalty to Osborne! At least he genuinely likes you, and I can tell you like him, too. Don't keep him waiting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, you're not exactly normal yourself! Remember, your Divine Body was obliterated and then restored!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star bit her lip, her cheeks even redder now. "I... I need to think about it! Let's just watch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she averted her gaze, staring off into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the far-off sky, the electric serpent grew larger and more agile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, more electric serpents began to rain down from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a radius of several 60 miles, the air crackled with energy as these serpents descended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's hair stood on end, and the deafening roar of thunder drowned out all other sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Multi-thunder Chainstorm!" Osborne shouted, his voice cutting through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all the electric serpents converged, forming a massive lightning cage that enveloped the entire area. Countless serpents swept through every inch of the prison, obliterating everything in their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the lightning cage dissipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reappeared among them, a look of satisfaction lighting up his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He announced proudly, "This is the Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Multi-thunder Chainstorm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It packs a powerful electric attack while also offering an impressive sealing capability! It's similar to Trevor's Universe-Sealing Formation but with even greater offensive strength. Anyone caught within the embrace of Multi-thunder Chainstorm will face a barrage of thousands of lightning strikes, and it won't stop until they're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent a shiver down everyone's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Anastasia's eyes sparkled brightly, her body crackling with energy as realization dawned on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going into seclusion!" she declared, and in the blink of an eye, she vanished from sight, her urgency palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood momentarily stunned before turning to Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up with Anastasia? Did something get to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe couldn't help but chuckle, "Oh, come on, it's your fault, Osborne! You inspired her! This is actually a good thing! She's probably had an epiphany looking at your Multi-thunder Chainstorm. Maybe now she's ready to grasp her own Divine Ascendance Technique!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up with excitement. "Anastasia is about to unlock her own Divine Ascendance Technique? That's fantastic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all need to step up too! I really believe that reaching Level Nine in our elemental essences is crucial for understanding the Divine Ascendance Technique!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if someone hasn't reached the level of Supernal Deity King, achieving Level Nine in elemental essence with enough insight can still lead to mastery of a Divine Ascendance Technique!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded in agreement, inspired by Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia said the same! We're all feeling the push&mdash;let's hurry up and go into seclusion ourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the group scattered, each determined to delve into their own training and chase their breakthroughs.</span></p></div>
