        <h1>Chapter 2229 Unimpressive-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the Wooden Golem's eyes flashed with a fierce </span><span>glint,</span><span> it zeroed in on Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Bryce didn't feel any immediate threat and stood his ground, cool as a cucumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Golem's energy signature started to change and finally settled at Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox quickly said, "The Wooden Golem scans its opponent's energy signature to figure out their cultivation level, and then it automatically adjusts its own power to match. Since Bryce is a Supernal Deity King at Ascension Three, the Golem will only use power equivalent to that stage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So as long as Bryce can beat the Golem, he'll pass the practical assessment. After that, he'll become an inner disciple of Peak Seven, and no one will dare to object."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement. "This Golem does seem to have a pretty potent energy signature."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox frowned, feeling the gravity of the situation. "Yeah, and there's something fishy about this Wooden Golem. Its power seems way stronger than normal. But it was made by Ms. Olsen, and it was indeed at Ascension Three...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrance better not pull any stunts!" Maddox threw a look in Terrance's and his gang's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance just sneered, his calmness oozing self-assurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he met Maddox's gaze, he let out a disdainful scoff. Maddox huffed and looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this show on the road!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Wooden Golem sprang to life, Bryce waved his hand casually, still looking as laid-back as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening noise, the Golem charged at Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, it moved a bit clumsily, but in no time, it was as swift and nimble as a real living being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Wooden Golem was right in front of Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its huge fist gathered power as it swung towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here it goes! Here it goes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd around them went wild with excitement. "How long do you think he can stay in the fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! I bet he'll last a minute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A minute? You're really overestimating him. This Golem was personally made by Ms. Olsen. Word has it that it's insanely powerful. If we had to take this practical exam again, most of us would have a hard time against these Golems!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I give him thirty seconds, max!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty seconds? That's being kind. He's just a hick from some small life-bearing planet. He thinks he's something special, but when it comes to facing a Wooden Golem made by Ms. Olsen, lasting thirty seconds would be a major achievement!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I doubt he'll even survive one punch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid all the noisy chatter, Bryce remained cool as a cucumber. As he felt the Golem's attack and sized up its power, he couldn't help but be taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Golem is really something!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it this fast? It's incredibly powerful, even stronger than some of the prodigies from the Paramount Supreme Clan. Those prodigies wouldn't stand a chance against these Wooden Golems at the same cultivation level. They'd be knocked out in an instant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Interesting, but it's no challenge! You think this Wooden Golem can stop me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Fat chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in his head, Bryce launched his counter-attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of dodging or backing off, he balled his fist and threw a thunderous punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful wave of energy burst out, shattering the Golem's attack and sending it flying back with a huge force. It crashed into the edge of the arena. Its eyes flickered weakly as it crumpled to the ground, barely able to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deathly hush fell over the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a moment ago, the spectators had been all fired up, arguing about how long Bryce could hold out against the Golem. Now, everyone's eyes were wide open, in disbelief at what they'd just seen.</span></p></div>
