        <h1>Chapter 1926 Space Scaling</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had engaged in a fierce battle with the two Supernal Deity Kings, yet none of it touched the little sapling nestled within its vibrant, multicolored barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything outside was repelled by this magical shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne's Shadow Drakes couldn't inflict any damage to the barrier, let alone harm the sapling inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured to himself, "Could it really be a juvenile of a root-based organism?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Either way, I must take it with me! But first, I need to seal away the memories of these two Supernal Deity Kings. One's a Supernal Deity King of earth and the other of fire. Their memories will be perfect to send to Diana and Kendra!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'll need to sift through and only keep the useful bits. The negative memories need to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly dove into their minds, sealing off their memories with precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he pondered how best to extract the sapling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a hefty structure&mdash;over a thousand yards tall&mdash;but when compared to the massive tree roots stretching for tens of thousands of miles, it felt almost insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, "These roots are over 10 thousand miles long; even Hope Haven wouldn't accommodate that! Should I just take the sapling by itself? Or maybe sever the roots into smaller sections?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But taking the sapling alone is out of the question! That decrepit root is clearly its source of nourishment. If I rip the sapling away from it, it could wither without its lifeline!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And slicing the roots? That's impossible! Though dried out, those roots are incredibly sturdy&mdash;strong enough that even I can't just cleave through them right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time was of the essence; two Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan lay dead, along with thousands of warriors. It wouldn't be long before even stronger warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan arrived to investigate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Osborne's current capabilities, he could hold his own against an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, but against an Ascension Two, escape would be his only option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I transport this massive root along with the sapling?" he mused, brainstorming various possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an idea struck him&mdash;the kind that brightens a foggy day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can cut the space containing the roots off from Celestara and then scale it down! My space elemental essence has reached Level Nine; I should be able to shrink or enlarge spaces! Let's give it a shot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him at this moment, cutting off a piece of space from Celestara was a simple task, despite the vast expanse measuring over 10 thousand miles wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, he had severed the entire section housing the decrepit roots and the sapling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But cutting the space was just the first step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The critical part lay ahead: he had to scale this space down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This posed a significant challenge for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several attempts that yielded mixed results, Osborne finally found the right technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his careful control, this domain of approximately 10 thousand miles began to shrink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the area shrank down to a thousand times its original size, Osborne began to feel a noticeable strain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is shrinking it a thousand times really my limit?" he mused, his brow furrowing with both determination and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him floated a transparent, circular space containing a massive, decaying root and a small sapling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This once monumental area, stretching 10 thousand miles across, had shrunk to just a few miles in diameter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, this size was more than sufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could easily store this compacted space within his Dimensional Space or place it in Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I want to see just how far I can push this! Let's find out how much smaller I can make this space!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne clenched his jaw and poured every ounce of his energy into his space elemental essence. He was determined to compress the area even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweat beaded on his forehead as he pushed himself to the limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he continued to concentrate, the space began to shrink further until it reached about ten yards in diameter. At that moment, he sensed he was nearing his breaking point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really as far as I can go? Then it's time to leverage some external help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold huff, Osborne connected to the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, channeling the power from the Blood Demon members. At his current level, he had reached the advanced Deity King Level. Meanwhile, all 10 thousand Blood Demons were also at Deity King Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, their energy surged into Osborne's body like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the influx of strength, Osborne felt his power quickly ramping up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, he reached the highest Deity King Level. However, he was still shy of attaining the rank of Supernal Deity King, even with the Blood Demon force at his disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had renewed energy to act on the shrinking space. Osborne concentrated intently, and the area began to diminish again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It shrank to five yards, then three, and then one.</span></p></div>
