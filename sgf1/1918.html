        <h1>Chapter 1917 Adolph's Soul Memory</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the weakness of his soul power and realizing he could no longer contend with Osborne, Adolph understood that he was finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, even if Osborne's soul power couldn't regenerate, Adolph was already beyond saving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of madness, he screamed, "If you won't let me live, then you won't live either! Your soul power is special because of your Soul Current Ocean, right? Fine! I'll destroy your Soul Current Ocean and drag you down with me! Explode!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's soul power detonated. To the outside world, it was a silent explosion, but within Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, it unleashed a tempest of chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had obliterated Adolph's Soul Current Ocean with a mere fragment of his soul power, and now, with Adolph's powerful soul power self-destructing, there was no way Osborne's unique Soul Current Ocean could withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The catastrophic explosion of soul power utterly annihilated it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a shame. Why did it have to come to this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured shortly after, surveying the aftermath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, his completely destroyed Soul Current Ocean began to regenerate rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Self-detonation doesn't work on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, relief washing over him, "Finally done with that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had faced an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King specializing in soul power under normal circumstances, I wouldn't stand a chance. My only option would have been to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he came into my Soul Current Ocean to meet his end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute&mdash;his memories!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly snapped back to attention, quickly searching for Adolph's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A person's memories were divided into two parts: one stored in the brain, known as body memory, and the other imprinted on the soul, referred to as soul memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Adolph's soul power had self-destructed, the memories etched into his soul wouldn't vanish so quickly. Activating his Satan's Eye, Osborne swiftly located Adolph's soul memory and began sealing it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the most profound memories were imprinted on the soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope Adolph's soul memory contains information about Soul Spark Oblivion and maybe even his battle experience! For a powerful practitioner, training insights are usually imprinted on the soul. Let's hope Adolph isn't an exception..." Osborne murmured as he quickly sifted through Adolph's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a look of delight spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Just as I hoped, all of Adolph's training insights are imprinted on his soul! His soul memory is devoid of anything else; it's all about how he cultivated soul power and controlled it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Soul Spark Oblivion&mdash;is right here among those memories!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Adolph's memories, I can fully grasp Soul Spark Oblivion! And through his experiences, I can enhance my control over soul power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he entered Hope Haven, initiating a new round of seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, his goal was to master Soul Spark Oblivion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Soul Spark Oblivion uses a unique method to forcibly ignite an enemy's soul, quickly incinerating their soul power! Unless the enemy's soul power is stronger than mine, they'll be ignited!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they don't die, they'll be severely injured! Most likely, their soul power will be burned away completely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wow! What a domineering attack method!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped, taken aback by the sheer power of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soul Spark Oblivion was incredibly domineering, capable of forcibly igniting an enemy's soul power. So far, there hadn't been any effective means to extinguish a soul once it had been ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only way to counter it was to forcibly sever the soul itself&mdash;an act requiring tremendous strength to cut away the ignited portion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even attempting to sever part of the soul was already a significant blow, and not everyone had the ability to pull it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Soul Spark Oblivion was a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with excitement as he thought, "This is exactly the kind of overwhelming soul power attack I need! With Soul Spark Oblivion in my arsenal, I'm finally lacking nothing! Before, Caesar's Supreme Sovereign's Armor made him nearly untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, if I face him again, just one strike of Soul Spark Oblivion can bypass that armor and ignite his soul power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He won't stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne dove into his understanding of the technique. His extraordinary comprehension skills kicked in, and despite Soul Spark Oblivion being a Divine Ascendance Technique typically reserved for Supernal Deity Kings, it posed no challenge for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three months later, Osborne had fully mastered Soul Spark Oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he didn't stop there; he continued his seclusion, delving deeper into Adolph's other memories to enhance his control over soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it took Osborne two years to absorb every fragment of Adolph's memories and experiences related to soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the end of it, his grasp of soul power was only slightly weaker than Adolph's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he lacked now was practical combat experience.</span></p></div>
