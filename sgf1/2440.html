        <h1>Chapter 2350 Escape</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't need to be so polite. Just focus on staying alive," Osborne said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha bit her lower lip and didn't say much. She quickly infused a stream of Sacred Power into Osborne's Spatial Clone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the Spatial Clone began to emit Agatha's aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This little trick won't fool a top warrior at the level of Empyrean Sacredness for long. Plus, we only have one chance. If we can't deceive him and take the opportunity to shake him off, then we won't have any chance at all," Osborne said, taking a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no matter what, this was the only solution he could think of. He had to try, and there was no time to waste. Otherwise, he would be surrounded by other warriors and lose his chance forever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked outside the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and saw a massive Chrono-Spatial Turbulence passing by.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instantly became excited. "Ascending Sacred Sanctum, enter that Chrono-Spatial Turbulence."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Controlling the Ascending Sacred Sanctum to enter the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, Osborne immediately felt dizzy. The power of the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence actually penetrated the defenses of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and affected them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne was not only proficient in spatial power but also skilled in time powers. He unleashed his strength to envelop the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, and they were no longer affected.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum was completely concealed within the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, swiftly flying deeper into it. Meanwhile, Osborne controlled a Spatial Clone to rush out of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, flying in another direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go ahead." The Spatial Clone entered a Chrono-Spatial Turbulence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne nervously watched behind him. If Bard wasn't drawn away by Osborne's Spatial Clone and continued chasing them, they would be in trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha was also very nervous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she didn't have Satan's Eye, so she couldn't know what was happening behind. She could only bite her lower lip, as if awaiting judgment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, she saw Osborne become excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's wrong?" Agatha quickly asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Our plan worked. This Chrono-Spatial Turbulence is strong enough to partially mask the Spatial Clone's aura. That warrior didn't notice anything unusual and went after it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, within the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, the Spatial Clone moves effortlessly, but that warrior's speed is affected. It will take him at least a few minutes to catch up and notice the problem."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These few minutes are enough for us to get far away. We should be safe now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, Agatha breathed a sigh of relief and smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "I actually survived. All the warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan on the Racial Convergence Planet couldn't protect me, but Osborne saved me. I have to say, this is a miracle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Osborne, Agatha was filled with gratitude, but she knew a simple thank you was far from enough to express her feelings, so she said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne giving her the Sublime Concealment Orb to use was already a huge favor, and she had no idea how to repay it. Moreover, Osborne saving her life meant preserving the hope of the entire Ember Phoenix Clan. This kindness was simply beyond repayment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha took a deep breath and said, "Osborne, I need some time to recover from my injuries."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Go ahead. If anything happens, I'll call you. Also, once we're sure we've completely shaken off the pursuit, I'll leave deep space and return to the Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Return to the Racial Convergence Planet?" Agatha murmured. Then, she nodded. "Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Agatha sat down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had already used the Sublime Concealment Orb to hide her aura, completely altering it, and even changed her appearance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even the people most familiar with Agatha wouldn't be able to recognize her standing right in front of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as she didn't use the power of Dark Phoenix, no one would know she was Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Bard found them, he probably wouldn't know she was Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Bard would definitely recognize the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "I probably can't use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum casually anymore. I don't know the identities of those ten warriors, but they must be the top warriors on Racial Convergence Planet. Once I use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, they'll definitely recognize me and realize I was the one who rescued Agatha. Then, I'll be in big trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but sigh, thinking, "This time rescuing Agatha seems like a huge loss for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I not only temporarily gave the Sublime Concealment Orb to Agatha, but my Ascending Sacred Sanctum was also exposed. I can't use it casually in public anymore. For now, it seems I gained nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne did not regret it. If he hadn't stepped in, Agatha would already be dead. Agatha is the Dark Phoenix; once she grows, she will surely become a high-ranking member of the Ember Phoenix Clan, or even one of the cosmos's top warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, as long as Agatha remembers his life-saving grace, the benefits he will gain will be absolutely unimaginable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne cheered up again. He looked outside and noticed that the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence seemed to be growing stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Where are we now? We've been drifting along with the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence. We'd better not drift too far. If that happens, it will be difficult to return to the Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but did not leave the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, there were ten top warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level chasing them. Without ensuring absolute safety, staying in this Chrono-Spatial Turbulence was safer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, where Osborne entered the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, ten people were standing quietly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all wore black masks. At this moment, their eyes beneath the masks were filled with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can't you sense Dark Phoenix's presence anymore? So, did she die in this Chrono-Spatial Turbulence?" one of them asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leading warrior shook his head and said, "She shouldn't be dead yet, because even if she were, I should still be able to lock onto her presence and find her body. But I truly can't sense her presence anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another person said, "If she's not dead, did she escape? Damn it. We actually let Dark Phoenix get away. How are we supposed to explain this to the organization? This was the best chance to eliminate Dark Phoenix, but we failed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, the others fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long time, the leading warrior said, "Let's keep searching for her. Dark Phoenix might be hiding somewhere nearby, using special means to conceal her presence. No matter what, we absolutely cannot let Dark Phoenix survive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, not only will we be in trouble, but the organization will face big problems too. Our actions have completely offended the Ember Phoenix Clan. If Dark Phoenix </span><span>rises and leads the Ember Phoenix Clan back to its peak, the organization will be in danger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the ten of them dispersed again, trying hard to find Agatha. Unfortunately, they found nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha and Osborne had already drifted far away with the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the complex and dangerous deep space, it was almost impossible for them to find her again.</span></p></div>
