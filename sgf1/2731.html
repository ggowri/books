        <h1>Chapter 2601 Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Ends-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro acted as the referee on the stage, and he saw everything most clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was through his words that everyone understood the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out that Osborne's arrow had already defeated Seraphina, but he didn&rsquo;t spare her. Instead, he instantly used spatial power to appear beside Seraphina and launched a close-range attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro noticed something was wrong and immediately stepped in to stop it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, it was too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne endured an attack from Zorro, quickly inflicted severe injuries on Seraphina, leaving massive wounds on her face and chest, and finally neatly severed both of her legs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone gasped sharply after figuring out the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is way too bold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Is he really not afraid of death?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In front of almost all the Royal Family members, defeating Seraphina wasn&rsquo;t enough for Osborne&mdash;he had to injure her so badly?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How dare he!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in the Royal Family members' area, everyone was glaring angrily at Osborne, filled with murderous intent, wishing they could go down and kill Osborne immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, they didn&rsquo;t do that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because today is the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony, and what&rsquo;s happening now is the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. At this moment, countless trillions of people across various cities in the Glorious Divine Kingdom are watching this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel through projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne defeated and injured Seraphina in the ring with his own strength. If they took action against Osborne, there would be no way to justify it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Others would only think that the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom cannot tolerate ordinary people being stronger than its members, jealous of talent. By then, who would still want to stay in the Glorious Divine Kingdom?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, although the Royal Family members were furious, they could only coldly watch Osborne, with no one taking action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clutched his chest and stood up, a smile on his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He certainly knew that the Royal Family wouldn&rsquo;t take action against him because of this, at least not in public. The Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose such face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at Zorro, a hint of killing intent flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just now, Zorro had truly gone all out to stop him from seriously injuring Seraphina. Zorro was an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. If Osborne hadn&rsquo;t reacted quickly enough to avoid a critical hit, he himself might have been seriously injured by now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, there&rsquo;s no way to continue participating in the top five ranking battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Zorro did it on purpose!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "You say I went too hard? I don&rsquo;t think this counts as going too hard! Before I fought her, she personally said she would seriously injure me, break my legs, and stop me from participating in the upcoming top five ranking battle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone heard it... In that case, is it considered going too hard if I dealt with her equally? But you... as a referee, you could have stopped me, yet you went all out against me, trying to seriously injure me. I wonder why?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, a cold glint flashed in Zorro's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You&rsquo;re still making excuses?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As a referee, it's my duty to ensure the safety of the contestants! When a contestant's life is in danger, I naturally have to step in to stop it! I already told you to stop, but you still wouldn't listen and wanted to kill your opponent! Of course, I had no choice but to take action to forcibly stop you from killing your opponent!"</span></p></div>
