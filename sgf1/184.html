        <h1>Chapter 184 Capture the Flag</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Apollo really agreed, Valentin became a little solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne who had proposed this 10-billion-dollar gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no way to resist Osborne's orders. After all, Osborne was the boss of Skyefall Security. But he didn't have any confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they really lost, Skyefall Security would be doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Valentin serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the change in Valentin's expression, Apollo couldn't help but think, "This guy thought that a gamble of 10 billion dollars could scare me and thought I would back down! He certainly didn't expect that I would agree to it. Now, you can't regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Apollo sneered, "My request is straightforward. In this battle between the two security companies, no outside help is allowed! Only those who are on the roster can participate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the number of people, I won't bully you. Each of us can send out 30 people. We can only use individual weapons in capture-the-flag mode in the field. Any questions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Valentin couldn't help but look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was precisely as Osborne had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the conditions proposed by Apollo were the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was worried that Skyefall Security would seek external assistance from the Draco Group. After all, everyone knew Skyefall Security was once a subsidiary of the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Skyefall Security sought assistance from the Draco Group and could also use the Draco Group's Class A defense system, there was no need for the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security was sure to win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both sides only used people on the roster and could only use individual weapons, which was the most fair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin thought of the two names Osborne asked him to add to the roster urgently and couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem! All the members of Skyefall Security who participate will be professional bodyguards registered on the official website, and there will be no external assistance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo breathed a sigh of relief and said with a smile, "Okay! All the members of Chevalier Security will also be professional bodyguards registered on the official website. By the way, not long ago, I just registered as a professional bodyguard for Chevalier Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I will also fight on behalf of Chevalier Security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Apollo looked at Valentin with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Valentin suddenly changed his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been prepared long ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo laughed and said proudly, "It's just a coincidence. You are unlucky. Even God is helping me! Chevalier Security will definitely win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was highly confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo actually had one more thing that he didn't tell Valentin. Not only had he registered as a professional bodyguard for Chevalier Security, but even the Grim Reaper Squad he brought back from abroad had all been registered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the reason why he was confident enough to agree to this 10-billion-dollar gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo thought, "With my leading and 29 members of the Grim Reaper Squad, Chevalier Security is sure to win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was extremely confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Every member of the Grim Reaper Squad is powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weakest among them are all Class C.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We have ten Class C+ warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I'm a genuine Class B metahuman, so we won't lose. Our power is enough to sweep away the average ancient family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can Skyefall Security defeat me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, I know Skyefall Security very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strongest one, Valentin, is in Class B, like me. But he is a martial artist, and in terms of strength, he is weaker than me, a Class B metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Skyefall Security only has ten experts above Class C.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They definitely have no more than three Class C+ warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of high-end combat capability, Skyefall Security is only one-third of Chevalier Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, Chevalier Security is sure to win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was very proud at this time, but Valentin was extremely solemn and couldn't help but look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, indicating that he didn't need to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin then snorted, "Mr. Chevalier, don't celebrate too early! It's still uncertain who will win! You have a noble status, but you have to fight in person. If you accidentally die on the battlefield, don't regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can, just come and kill me! I can't wait any longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo sneered, "I think the time should be tonight, and the place will be the Silent Valley outside the city. I remember that it belongs to the Radcliffe family. No one will take advantage of the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The remaining time is enough for me to invite the five ancient families in Skyefall to be witnesses. With them, no one can regret it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, you can also ask someone to be a witness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin sneered, "Don't worry. I will! As for the time and place, I am fine with them! See you tonight in the Silent Valley!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Valentin turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo did not stay for long as well and quickly left the Radcliffe Manor to prepare for tonight's battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a gamble with ten billion dollars. Even he had to take it seriously. No matter how confident he was, he had to prepare well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not leave and stay in the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Radcliffe family would definitely go to watch the battle in the evening, and he would just follow them then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A ten-billion-dollar gamble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter who wins, Skyefall will not be peaceful in the future," murmured Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa asked, "Aunt Donna, who do you think will win between Skyefall Security and Chevalier Security?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna spoke without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The winner will be Chevalier Security!"</span></p></div>
