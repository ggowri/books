        <h1>Chapter 2269 Last Two Showdowns</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's crushing defeat of Pero left the crowd in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arena fell hushed as if all the air had been sucked out. The supporters of Azure Haven Academy were left dumbfounded, their hopes shattered into a million pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd known Pero might face an uphill battle, especially after his recent losses to Tyson, Clara, Marreese, and Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one had expected him to go down so hard&mdash;knocked out cold by a single punch from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when Pero faced Leroy, he hadn't been routed like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of foreboding settled over the Azure Haven Academy fans like a dark cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is Osborne really on a roll that'll take him all the way to the championship? Can Leroy and Marreese put the brakes on him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-unshakable confidence of the fans began to crumble, replaced by a gnawing sense of doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, the disciples of Mystic Sirius Sect were beside themselves with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's place in the top three was a game-changer for their sect, a long-awaited triumph they hadn't seen in a century of city duels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Year after year, they'd been in the shadow of Azure Haven Academy and Fantasia Isle, always feeling like the underdogs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the tides had turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's meteoric rise to the top three gave them a reason to celebrate at last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Angela couldn't suppress a smile, her heart brimming with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's making us beam with pride!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who could have seen this coming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>There are only two matches left. Marreese and Leroy are no pushovers, but I'm itching to see what he'll do next.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, the higher-ups from Azure Haven Academy wore glum looks, huddled together with frowns as they whispered to one another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battles raged on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After vanquishing Pero, Osborne scarcely had a moment to catch his breath before he was summoned back into the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, his opponent was Marreese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The next showdown, Marreese from Azure Haven Academy takes on Osborne from Mystic Sirius Sect! Step onto the stage, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the referee declared the start of the match, Marreese didn't hesitate for a second and bounded onto the platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd roared to life again, throwing their full support behind Marreese in the hopes of halting Osborne's unstoppable charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese shot a fierce glare at Osborne, his jaw set like steel, his every pore oozing anger and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd already tasted defeat at the hands of Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Losing to Osborne would mean he'd be completely out of the running for a top-three spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the champion of last year's city duel, the very thought of not making it into the top ranks was unbearable to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his last shot at reclaiming his former glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could just beat Osborne, and then count on Leroy to take out both Osborne and Clara, they'd all end up with the same record of thirteen wins and two losses, tying for second place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second place was Marreese's Holy Grail, and he was dead set on seizing this golden opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, your winning streak stops right here! I'm the one who's going to knock you off your pedestal&mdash;you won't get past me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely flashed a smile. "Really? Well, let's see you make good on that claim!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he swiftly strung an arrow onto his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese tightened his grip on his colossal battle blade, his voice as frigid as arctic ice. "They say your archery skills are unparalleled, that you can fell any foe with a single arrow. But let's find out which reigns supreme&mdash;your arrows or my blade!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Marreese swung his sword with all his might. A menacing arc of light sliced through the air, hurtling straight towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a disdainful scoff and loosed his arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power arrow shot forward like a lightning bolt, colliding head-on with Marreese's blade strike in a deafening explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwave rippled through the arena like a tempest, causing the spectators to stumble backward. Their faces blanched at the sheer, overwhelming force of the clash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the crowd watched in utter disbelief as Marreese's blade strike crumbled to pieces, while Osborne's arrow barreled on relentlessly towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was crystal clear. Osborne had won this round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Sacred Power arrow had outclassed Marreese's attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese's eyes bugged out in shock. He just couldn't wrap his head around the fact that his assault had been overpowered by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no time to wallow in disbelief; he swung his gigantic sword once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With two lightning-fast slashes, Marreese finally managed to deflect Osborne's Sacred Power arrow. But before he could catch his breath, three more arrows were already streaking towards him like deadly missiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Marreese felt his anger reach a boiling point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe this! I've always been the one in control of the fight! No one can push me back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break through!" he roared, his quasi-Sacred Artifact sword a blur as he desperately hacked at Osborne's arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force of the impacts made blood spurt from his mouth, and Marreese staggered backward, but he somehow managed to shatter those three arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a sense of dread washed over Marreese as he saw ten more arrows speeding straight towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of fear flashed across Marreese's eyes. </span><br><span>How on earth can Osborne unleash such overwhelming power? Isn't he worried about depleting his Sacred Power? He's already fired four arrows, and now he's sending ten more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is insane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can his Sacred Power be so boundless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese was completely flabbergasted, but there was no time for pondering. He had to dig deep and give it his all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ten Sacred Power arrows?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was simply no way he could defend against them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blood-curdling scream rang out as Marreese was sent flying by the hailstorm of arrows. If it hadn't been for the referee's timely intervention to block the arrows, Marreese would have been seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne wins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the referee announced the result, the supporters of Azure Haven Academy were once again struck dumb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had triumphed yet again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had pinned all their hopes on Marreese, but he'd been utterly crushed by Osborne's onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this win, Osborne had at least locked down the runner-up spot, while Marreese was now out of the running for a top-three finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can he be this strong?! Marreese's attacks are incredibly powerful, yet he got beaten in a head-on clash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's only at the Ascension Eight level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only bright side is that his Sacred Power must be severely depleted! Next up is Leroy, and Leroy is bound to win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Leroy is the real champion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Below the level of Empyrean Sacredness, no one can defeat Leroy! At least not in Tempest Fortress City! Leroy is unbeatable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the supporters of Azure Haven Academy pinned all their remaining hopes on Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Leroy stood at the arena's edge, her eyes locked intently on Osborne. "I underestimated you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're an intriguing opponent! But you're not yet up to the task of beating me. I'll take you down myself and claim the title of the undisputed champion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The championship is as good as mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Leroy closed </span><span>her</span><span> </span><span>eyes, as if grounding </span><span>herself</span><span> </span><span>and gearing up for the ultimate showdown with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her wait wasn't long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Azure Haven Academy clearly had no intention of giving Osborne a chance to catch his breath. They were set on seizing the opportunity presented by his depleted Sacred Power and having Leroy knock him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before the referee made the announcement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From Azure Haven Academy, Leroy, takes on Osborne from the Mystic Sirius Sect!"</span><span> </span></p></div>
