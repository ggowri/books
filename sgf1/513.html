        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well, you made a smart decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled and said, "Then come with me now. There's no need to prepare anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia hesitated for a moment, then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Evelyn and said, "Mom, I'm leaving the Caldwell family to you! Tell him I'll come back for him if you ever get the chance to see Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The next time I see him, I want him to kneel before me and regret his coldness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn looked at Ophelia's face full of hatred and felt incredibly worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to speak, George calmly said, "I think it's better to kill her. It's best if no one knows you're becoming a disciple of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he looked at Evelyn with a murderous expression, as if ready to strike at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn was terrified and turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's expression changed, and she shouted, "Stop! If you dare kill her, I will never forgive you! And I will never go with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, George shrugged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're too merciful. That's not good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's none of your business! If you dare hurt her, I'll never let you get away with it. Send her back, and then I'll go with you! Otherwise, you might as well kill me too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stood in front of Evelyn. Her face was full of determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn looked at Ophelia with tears of gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George calmly said, "Since you insist, I'll spare her. She's just an insignificant person anyway. Whether she lives or dies doesn't matter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a moment, George acted again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them were enveloped by a force. Ophelia and Evelyn felt a blur, and they were back at the Caldwell Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia looked at Evelyn and said through clenched teeth, "Mom, go back and take care of yourself! I won't be able to stay with you anymore. If you can, find someone to marry. You don't have to stay here forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Evelyn burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many years ago, she could have left the Caldwell family. She had saved enough money to live on, but she chose to stay because she had become friends with Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Ophelia was leaving too. What reason did she have to stay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn said earnestly, "Ophelia, you need to take care of yourself too. And don't let hatred control you. We did make some mistakes. Don't keep getting stuck on them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Ophelia's face turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did nothing wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, she took one last look at the Caldwell Manor, where she had lived for over twenty years. She turned to George. She said, "Let's go! I want to get stronger immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, no problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled. He was not even glancing at Evelyn and disappeared with Ophelia instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at the Caldwell Manor and suddenly felt a chill. The only thing keeping her there was gone. She suddenly wanted to take a walk by the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn left the Caldwell Manor and headed toward the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after Evelyn left the Caldwell Manor, a terrifying fire engulfed the entire estate. Nearly a hundred people from the Caldwell family, not one of them escaped. They were all consumed by the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an act of arson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man hid in the darkness, controlling the flames to ensure everyone in the Caldwell Manor was burned to ashes. Only then did a satisfied smile appear on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time powers, huh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> has waited nearly a century for this moment! No one knows about this. All those aware of it must be silenced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all burned away..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, the time powers began counting the bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Caldwell family had a total of eighty-six people. Apart from Ophelia, there were eighty-five others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, there were exactly eighty-five bodies in the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, it's all taken care of. I can report back now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, the man disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't realize that he hadn't completely wiped out the members of the Caldwell family. Evelyn had already left the Caldwell Manor. The reason there were exactly eighty-five bodies was simply because it had a guest at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn hadn't gone far when she saw the Caldwell Manor engulfed in roaring flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned for a moment. She was about to rush back to help with the fire, but then she suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, this isn't an accidental fire! Someone's setting it on purpose!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that they're trying to silence everyone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people took Ophelia, and now they want to silence everyone in the Caldwell family, too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They're monsters!" Evelyn thought in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fear gripped Evelyn's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't left the Caldwell Manor, wouldn't she also have perished in the flames? Wouldn't she have been silenced too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Evelyn no longer dared to return and quickly fled into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to get out of there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If those who silenced the Caldwell family found out she was still alive, they would surely come after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to escape to a safe place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the Caldwell Manor was completely burned down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless people gathered outside the Caldwell Manor to watch, but no one noticed a tall, graceful figure suddenly appear among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at the Caldwell Manor. Her face was full of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, it's here?" she murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This person was Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa stared at the charred remains of the Caldwell Manor. Her brow furrowed tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm late... Who could it be that awakened her power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Were they all silenced? It was done so thoroughly... Looks like finding her won't be easy after all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After whispering to herself, Isa walked into the ruins.</span></p></div>
