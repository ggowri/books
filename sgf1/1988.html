        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the rules, Osborne was eligible to participate in the border competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, he could not only compete in the Ascension One matches but also take part in the Ascension Two and Ascension Three contests if he felt confident enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne truly believed in his abilities, even the Ascension Four matches were within his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this was all contingent on the God of Light granting him permission to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final roster of participants would be submitted by each major faction, and it was the God of Light who would make the ultimate decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she doubted Osborne's strength, he would be disqualified from participating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, I need to focus on improving my strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With seven days until the border competition, that's like four years in Hope Haven&mdash;plenty of time to level up and prepare for the impending war," he thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne put aside thoughts of the competition and dedicated himself fully to his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His goal was to elevate both Spatial Clone and Undead Cataclysm to Level Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Level Eight Spatial Clone would allow him to create 256 clones simultaneously, while a Level Eight Undead Cataclysm could summon up to 10 million Dark Undeads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he succeeded, he would possess an even greater ability to influence the outcome of localized battles once the full-scale war erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by as he immersed himself in his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Osborne who felt the weight of the looming conflict; Anastasia, Zoe, and everyone in the Hudson family sensed the shadows of war approaching, and each was pushing themselves to enhance their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A year later, a significant event unfolded in Hope Haven&mdash;Anastasia had broken through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After advancing her Divine Body to Level Ten and realizing there was no further enhancement to be had, she made the bold choice to ascend to Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Divine Flame fused with her Divine Body, and although it hadn't transformed into the Infinite Sacred Body, it was immensely powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She faced the trials of the Ascension Stairway and passed with ease, becoming an Ascension One Supernal Deity King without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, breakthroughs began to ripple through the ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the second year, Mila, Zoe, and Kendra all ascended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The following year saw Hannah, Diana, and Bryce join their ranks, each choosing to break through when their Divine Bodies reached the pinnacle of Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their Divine Flames fused with their Divine Bodies once more, allowing their forms to evolve into Level Ten, known as the Omnipotent Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they were all classified as Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings, their combat prowess far exceeded that of typical warriors at their level, and they showed no signs of slowing down in their quest for improvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one of them was committed to their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shadow of war loomed over everyone, driving them to enhance their skills as much as possible before the inevitable conflict began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This atmosphere deeply influenced Osborne as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides his own training, he made time to spar with them, pointing out their weaknesses and helping them refine their techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the fourth year rolled around, after four years of relentless training and insight, Osborne finally sensed the breakthrough he had been waiting for in both Spatial Clone and Undead Cataclysm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He halted all activities, focusing his mind intensely on understanding and mastering his powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the outside world buzzed with activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the God of Light's call, the coalition of various factions within the Human Community began to gather at the border.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Numbers swelled dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, over 10 billion warriors from the Human Community amassed at the West Zone border battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight was overwhelming&mdash;a sea of warriors stretched as far as the eye could see, a testament to their collective determination as they prepared for the trials ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community's coalition was organized into divisions of one million warriors each, forming an impressive total of 10 thousand armies, all lined up along the sprawling border that stretched for tens of millions of miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But across from them loomed an even greater threat&mdash;the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With numbers at least five times greater than the Human Community's forces, the Dark Deity Legion boasted over 50 billion warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air between the two sides crackled with tension, a palpable sense of cold malice that sent shivers down the spines of those on the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast to the Human Community, the Dark Deity Legion appeared relaxed, as if the outcome was already in their hands. It felt as though, with a single command, they could unleash a full-scale assault that would tear through the human ranks like paper, advancing without a care in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence radiated from them, a stark reminder of their overwhelming numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the Human Community side, however, every warrior wore a grave expression. A heavy, suffocating cloud of dread hung over them, making even the simplest act of breathing feel laborious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with an enemy five times their size, how could they muster any confidence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere fact that they hadn't turned and fled was a testament to their bravery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stood there, many gazed upwards at the magnificent palace towering in the sky, radiant like a sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Sanctum of Light&mdash;a beacon of hope amidst the encroaching darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days prior, the God of Light had arrived at the border battlefield with her Sanctum of Light. The immense structure radiated brilliance, illuminating every corner of the battlefield that stretched for millions of miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Dark Deity Legion could see it clearly from their position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a serious expression crossed the faces of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light and her Sanctum of Light had thwarted their numerous attempts to conquer the West Zone over the past millennium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time they had the upper hand, the emergence of the blinding Sanctum had turned the tide, preventing them from swallowing up the region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with over 50 billion Dark Deity Legion warriors gathered, they were set to launch a full-scale assault once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would the Sanctum of Light be able to stop them again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Dark Deity Legion members looked skyward, their eyes drawn to a towering, ominous structure&mdash;Ninefold Heaven's Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This colossal dark tower, equally as imposing as the Sanctum of Light, stood nine stories high, shrouded in swirling black mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ninefold Heaven's Tower!" they murmured in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the residence of the Nine Dark Sovereigns, a formidable super divine artifact that embodied their collective might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of the tower ignited excitement and reverence among the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrival of Ninefold Heaven's Tower meant that all Nine Dark Sovereigns were present and accounted for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their combined strength, could the God of Light withstand this onslaught?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could the Human Community hold its ground?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the Ninefold Heaven's Tower began to tremble, and from its highest level, a figure cloaked in black emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing before the tower, he seemed small, yet anyone who laid eyes on him felt immense pressure, as if a mountain had descended upon the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the leader of the Nine Dark Sovereigns&mdash;Icy One, the first general under Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, Icy One's colossal projection materialized in the center of the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was fixed intently on the distant Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his voice boomed like thunder, echoing across the entire battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, the time has come! Are you and your Human Community ready?"</span></p></div>
