        <h1>Chapter 118 Forced Kiss</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span>'s kiss was as fleeting as a dragonfly's touch. Before Osborne could even register what had happened, she had already pulled back, grinning mischievously at the flustered look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, thinking, "What just happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she really just pull a sneak attack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gives me a peck and calls it a reward? The worst part is, I didn't even get a chance to savor it before it ended!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing </span><span>Isa</span><span>'s teasing smile, Osborne decided to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward quickly, wrapping his arms around her slender waist. With a playful grin, he said, "A peck on the cheek as a reward? That's not nearly enough. I want more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before </span><span>Isa</span><span> could react, he bent down and kissed her on the lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's bold move clearly took </span><span>Isa</span><span> aback. Her eyes widened in shock, and her body went rigid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until she felt Osborne's tongue trying to pry open her lips that she snapped out of her stupor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, </span><span>Isa</span><span> grabbed Osborne's arm and, with a swift motion, threw him across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow!" Osborne yelped as he flew through the air, feeling disoriented and seeing stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of </span><span>Isa</span><span>'s throw left him utterly defenseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you trying to kill me?" Osborne called out in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span> wiped her red lips with the back of her hand, glaring at him. "You cheeky bastard, how dare you kiss me? You're lucky I didn't break you into pieces."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you kissed me first!" Osborne protested, struggling to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew </span><span>Isa</span><span> had shown restraint; otherwise, with her strength - evidenced by kicking Milo across the room and punching Pamela into oblivion - </span><span>Isa</span><span> could have seriously injured him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span>'s strength was formidable, but Osborne had no regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I'm a man, and </span><span>Isa</span><span> had the nerve to kiss me. How could I not return the kiss?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too bad I didn't get to taste her little tongue properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a missed opportunity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span>, meanwhile, was fuming, her face flushed red all the way to her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at her, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought. "When I first met </span><span>Isa</span><span>, she was incredibly bold - flirting with me and making suggestive comments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought she was pretty open-minded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after just one kiss, she's blushing like mad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding her reaction oddly endearing, Osborne couldn't help but chuckle. "If you feel cheated, I can let you kiss me back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span>'s face turned an even deeper shade of red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such a brat. If you keep messing with me, I swear I'll make sure you'll never be a man again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave him a threatening look, glancing pointedly at his lower half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a shiver run down his spine, Osborne instinctively crossed his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed nervously. "Just kidding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's getting late. You should go get some rest. I'll stay here and keep an eye on my sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have to be so bossy?" </span><span>Isa</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot him another glare before running off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched her retreating figure, touching his lips as if reminiscing about the taste of her kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she was gone, he pulled out a cross necklace from his pocket and examined it closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This necklace had been taken from Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was deeply intrigued by it, suspecting it might be the legendary artifact known as Cain's Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powers it had displayed on Paul seemed strikingly similar to those of the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, it had transformed Paul into a Blood Clan member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Blood Cross' abilities was to elevate an ordinary person into a powerful Blood Clan member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Clarissa's ability to detect lies had no effect on Paul, possibly because of this very cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne first spied on Paul, Paul had been engaged in a video call with Davy. At that moment, the cross necklace around Paul's neck suddenly emitted a red glow, prompting Paul to immediately end the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, Osborne hadn't given it much thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, reflecting on it, he suspected that the necklace might have been issuing a warning to Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed the cross had detected Osborne's surveillance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything pointed to the necklace being linked to the ancient artifact known as the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it's not the actual Blood Cross, it must be closely related. But why can't I detect anything unusual about it while it's in my possession?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been examining the necklace for a long time, but he hadn't found anything particularly special about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Could it be that it needs to be bonded to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then recalled that some special items required a particular ritual or connection to activate their powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This process was often referred to as "bonding".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been unable to use the necklace because it likely hadn't accepted him as its master yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What do I need to do? Could it be that the Blood Cross requires a blood bond?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought in mind, Osborne suddenly bit his finger, allowing a drop of blood to fall onto the cross necklace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, something strange began to happen.</span></p></div>
