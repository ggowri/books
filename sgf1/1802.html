        <h1>Chapter 1801 An Unexpected Turn of Events</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caesar was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the Five Brilliant Scions of the Paramount Supreme Clan, a prodigy ranked among the top five in the younger generation, Caesar had met his end at the hands of Bryce, who had decapitated him on the arena floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that very moment, a terrifying force erupted from Caesar's lifeless body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shadowy figure materialized before Bryce in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shouted, his face paling as he quickly unleashed his spatial power, trying to pull Bryce to safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant the figure appeared, it struck Bryce squarely in the chest with a swift, powerful blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed was so astonishing that Bryce, who had just savored the thrill of killing Caesar, didn't have a chance to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact echoed through the arena. Gasping, Bryce felt the force tear through his divine power defenses&mdash;the Supreme Malevolence Shield that had automatically activated and his Level Eight mid-stage Divine Body were no match for this overwhelming attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all his defenses crumbled, leaving a gaping hole in his chest. His internal organs were obliterated, and even his Divine Body began to disintegrate rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was stunned, utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Kendra, and the others stood frozen, their expressions mirroring shock and disbelief. None of them had anticipated such a sudden turn of events. As they watched Bryce's body collapse under the onslaught of the shadowy figure, their hearts raced, feeling as if they were being squeezed in a vice. They opened their mouths to scream, but no sound escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne was still in motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A ripple of spatial energy surged beside Bryce, and in the next instant, his shattered body was safely at Osborne's side, who caught him just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened as he assessed Bryce's condition. "Hang in there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he tapped into the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, rushing to heal Bryce's wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah! We need life energy! Hurry!" he shouted, urgency lacing his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah snapped back to reality, her face pale with shock. Upon hearing Osborne's command, she immediately summoned her life power, a torrent of vitality flooding into Bryce's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Hannah poured their energies into Bryce, but even with their combined efforts, his condition remained dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body continued to disintegrate, albeit at a slower pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah exclaimed, her complexion growing even more ashen, "It's not working!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of power is this? It's weakening our healing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried, panic creeping into her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened, gritting his teeth. "This is Lord Malevolence's dark energy! I can't believe he left behind a fragment of it inside Caesar! Its potency is so high that it's dampening our healing effects! Keep the life energy flowing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne fought to harness the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's power to mend Bryce's injuries while simultaneously channeling dark power, attempting to purge Lord Malevolence's dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could expel this malevolent force, the healing properties of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would surely restore Bryce quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt the crushing weight of the power disparity between himself and Lord Malevolence. Just a remnant of dark energy left behind by Lord Malevolence was enough to thwart him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized with horror that his peak Level Eight dark elemental essence was utterly ineffective against this dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair washed over him as he grappled with the reality of their situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's injuries hadn't healed at all; they were still in a state of collapse and decay. If this kept up, his body would soon completely shut down, and he'd be dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Kendra rushed over, her face a mix of tension and worry as she watched Bryce's body break down before her eyes, tears streaming down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra! Kendra, hang in there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra, you'll be okay!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on, Osborne will save you! Kendra, you have to hold on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra's cries echoed, but Bryce was already unconscious, and even in his sleep, the agony of his deteriorating body caused his brow to furrow in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and snapped, "This can't go on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go get the White Miracle Elixir! All of it! Every single vial!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice carried to Anastasia, who immediately nodded and dashed into Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She made a beeline for the central warehouse and emerged with every vial of White Miracle Elixir she could find.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sixty-five in total!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, she was beside Osborne, handing them over in a rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swiftly crushed a white Miracle Elixir in his hand, the liquid shimmering with an otherworldly glow. Without hesitation, Osborne tilted Bryce's head back and poured the elixir into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the painful processes of collapse and decay started to slow down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's working! Keep using the White Miracle Elixir on him!"</span></p></div>
