        <h1>Chapter 2294 Kick Off-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Clara, taken aback by her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you don't have to do that! Once you find a token, just register it under your own name," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara shook her head firmly. "No way! They've gotta be registered in your name. That's the only way you'll have a shot at a higher ranking. Otherwise, we'll both end up in the dumps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused for a moment, then finally nodded, deciding not to turn down her offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara continued, "Which layer are you gonna be in? You're way stronger than me. You should be able to stay in the fourth layer for ages, maybe even last a bit in the fifth layer, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you flit between the fourth and fifth layers? Just steer clear of the sixth layer. No matter how lucrative those tokens are, your life's worth a whole lot more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned and nodded. "Sure thing! I won't go taking any unnecessary risks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hashing out their game plan with Clara, she headed back to her own courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was about to catch some Z's when there came a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced over and recognized Leroy. He opened the courtyard gate, a look of bemusement on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy nodded, his expression dead serious. "Osborne, are you really set on dueling Conrad in the sixth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm? You're no match for Conrad, and the sixth layer's a real death trap. Don't go off half-cocked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and replied, "You came all the way here just to tell me that? If that's the case, head back and get some shut-eye! The state duel's tomorrow. Don't go burning your energy on my business. I can handle things on my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Leroy hesitated, nibbling on her lower lip. "I'm sorry! Maybe I can't give you a hand, but I'll be there with you! At least if things go south in the sixth layer, I can pull you outta there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Leroy spun on her heel and took off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just shook his head, not really paying it much mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the night rolled by, and the state duel was finally on the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, Frost Peak City was buzzing with activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Folks from far and wide swarmed in to catch a glimpse of the event, and the city was all but bursting at the seams. Unfortunately, the state duel was gonna go down in the Arctic Maw Chasm, so they couldn't get up close and personal. Instead, they'd have to rely on some camera-like gadgets that had been set up in the chasm beforehand to project the action up in the sky above the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, there were two leaderboards floating up in the city sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was, of course, the old state duel strength leaderboard, with Agatha sitting pretty at the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other leaderboard, though, was as empty as a desert right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the state duel score leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the state duel hadn't kicked off yet, no one had racked up any state duel points, so the board was blank as a slate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the state duel got underway, the on-lookers could use this leaderboard to keep tabs on who was raking in the most points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final state duel standings would also be decided by this very leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, Osborne and the others had already made it to the outskirts of the Arctic Maw Chasm, all geared up and raring to enter and start the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert was hovering in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a wave of his hand, and in a flash, every single participant in the duel, Osborne included, got a chest badge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This chest badge had a screen on it, and there were two numbers flashing on the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, both of those numbers were a big fat zero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly cottoned on to what the chest badge was and what those two numbers signified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One number represented the state duel score a person had earned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other number was the ranking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both numbers would be updated non-stop once the state duel started. Once one found a token, all he had to do was hold it up against the chest badge, and the points from that token would be registered in his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tokens in the first layer were only worth one measly point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ones in the second layer were worth ten points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It went all the way up to the sixth layer, where tokens were worth a cool hundred thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert announced, "Alright! Everyone got their state duel chest badges, right? Now, head into the Arctic Maw Chasm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your state duel is officially kicking off now!"</span></p></div>
