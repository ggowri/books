        <h1>Chapter 157 Something Happened</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "It's more powerful than Raymond's full-strength attack and almost reaching Class B, really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Satan's Eye had never let him down. It devoured Raymond's lightning elemental essence, letting Osborne own a new power. He could control lightning, and the attack was even more powerful than Raymond's full-strength attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't have elemental power, but through Satan's Eye, he owned it and could control lightning elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that he would be able to control more elemental powers in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... You stole my lightning elemental essence! Fuck you! How did you do it? You thief! I'll kill you!" Raymond finally figured it out and roared madly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne's long blood-red hair bound him tightly, and he couldn't move at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "You guessed it right, but there is no prize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to think about how to deal with Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had three plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first was to kill Raymond. Raymond was no longer of value to him. He had seen his trump card and even knew the secret that Satan's Eye could devour the elemental essence. Osborne could not let him expose the secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the dead could keep secrets forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second was to let Raymond take the amnesia drug and then hand him over to the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond was the main figure in the assassination of Clarissa. It was right to hand him over to the Radcliffe family. They could probably dig out more information from Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The amnesia drug could let Raymond forget what had happened in the past half hour, so there was no need to worry about him leaking the secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third was to hand Raymond over to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's research needed metahuman. She had helped Osborne a lot during this period. Handing Raymond over to Isa could repay some of her favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Osborne didn't kill Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to hand Raymond over to the Radcliffe family and let them interrogate him. Then, he could hand him over to Isa for research, squeezing out the maximum value from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took out the amnesia drug and prepared to let Raymond take it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class B amnesia drug!" Raymond's face turned pale. He said coldly, "Bastard, you won't have a good end! The Aberrants won't let you go. The old woman and Ms. Radcliffe are waiting for you in hell, and you will go to hell soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what he said, Osborne couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond's words had a different meaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Is something going to happen to Donna and Clarissa?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or has something already happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can this be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Donna and Clarissa should be outside the slums, waiting for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, Raymond is here. Who else can hurt Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned and asked, "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond sneered, "Bastard, do you really think I don't know your plan? Take the initiative to attack? I have already taken advantage of your plan and set up a trap. Unfortunately, I misjudged your strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Donna and Ms. Radcliffe have probably died. Their enemies are two Class C+ metahumans!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Donna can't defeat them. Ms. Radcliffe is dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was stern. "What did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond sneered, "When we were fighting, Donna and Ms. Radcliffe had already fallen into the encirclement. If nothing unexpected happened, they are probably dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned and immediately contacted Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before taking action, he muted all his contact tools. He tried to contact Donna but found that he could not get through to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Did something really happen to Donna?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't bother to talk to Raymond but pinched his jaw and forced him to take the amnesia drug. Then, he knocked him out with a punch and carried him outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speeding back, Osborne tried to contact Clarissa, Barlyn, and even Violet and Sharon, but he could not get through to them at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something really happened!" Osborne panicked. He hoped that Clarissa was still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fourth test as the successor was to pursue Clarissa and own her. If Clarissa died, all would be over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was careless this time. No, Clarissa must not die!" Osborne suppressed the anxiety and used the ocular energy to lift him and increase his speed. He rushed out of the passage at a rapid speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't want Clarissa to die mainly because she was related to the test of his successor. Still, another part of the reason was that after spending some time with her, he already had feelings for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Clarissa died today because of his plan, Osborne would never forgive himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Wait for me. I'll be there soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna brought Clarissa to the location of the second Bodyguard Unit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they saw the members of the third Bodyguard Unit lying on the ground in the distance, seemingly dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who killed them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harris, what happened?" Donna asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris said with an anxious look, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, I really don't know what happened. They suddenly fainted, and then their hearts stopped beating, and their breathing stopped."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Donna looked angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa hurriedly said, "Aunt Donna, let's investigate the reason later. We have to save them now. After a while, even I can't save them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Clarissa ran over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa immediately used Holy Light Healing, trying to rescue these people who were dying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, something happened.</span></p></div>
