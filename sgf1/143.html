        <h1>Chapter 143 The Fourth Test</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning the truth, Osborne's body began to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As decades of confusion finally cleared up, his eyes instantly turned red and welled up with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All along, Osborne had thought that he was abandoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed he was an unwanted orphan and blamed his parents for the suffering and torment he had endured over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hated his parents and despised them for abandoning him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now Godfather told him that his parents hadn't abandoned him. They had only gone missing unexpectedly, which led to him becoming an orphan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the realization sank in, tears began to fall from Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather said, "Osborne, I actually wasn't planning to tell you this now. But I've already lost a son. I don't want to lose my grandson too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had control over the first three tests, but what comes next is beyond even my power as the Godfather. So, give up. Don't repeat your father's mistakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can stay with me, and as long as I live, I can protect you. No one will harm you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body trembled at these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of answering, he questioned, "Even you, the Godfather, can't find my parents? Aren't you all-powerful? Aren't you supposed to be capable of anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather shook his head and sighed, "I tried, but I can't find them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This world is far more complicated than you think. There are many things that even I can't touch, and these are the things you won't encounter for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and stated firmly, "If you can't find them, I'll take on the search myself. I won't give up. I'll go through the tests and accomplish what my father couldn't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Godfather fell silent again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "Thank you for telling me about my parents. At least now I know I wasn't unwanted or abandoned. I will find them, whatever it takes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, please tell me what the fourth test is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather closed his eyes and sank into deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, he opened his eyes again, and Osborne noticed that his aged, somewhat cloudy eyes seemed a bit red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather said, "Alright. Since you are determined, I won't persuade you anymore. If you're set on finding your parents, I, as your grandfather, will do everything I can to help you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This fourth test, your father also took it back in the day. It was during this test that he met your mother, fell in love, and then had you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned upon hearing that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather continued, "As a descendant of the Augustine family, you have the finest genetic makeup. Your wife must also be equally outstanding so that your offspring will be born with the best genes, ensuring the continued strength of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, pay attention. Your fourth successor test is...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To make Clarissa, the chosen one of the Radcliffe family, your wife. She is a metahuman with the most powerful genes. She is the most suitable candidate for your wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't give you a time limit this time. Do everything in your power to make the Radcliffe family's chosen one yours. Don't let me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Godfather finished speaking, Osborne's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought in shock, "My fourth successor test is to pursue Clarissa and make her my woman? Is that even possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then couldn't help but frown. It wasn't that he found Clarissa lacking. On the contrary, he agreed with Godfather that Clarissa was indeed an extraordinary woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because she possessed three powers and was so beautiful that Osborne was left in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who wouldn't want a girlfriend or even a wife like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the problem was that Osborne had just found out that Clarissa was engaged. Her fianc&eacute;, Apollo, was no ordinary man. He was the heir of the prestigious Chevalier family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chevalier family's strength was unparalleled. In Skyefall, they had such dominance that they could be considered the underground rulers with absolute authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that if he tried to pursue Clarissa, the Chevalier family would certainly come after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Clarissa was Austin's best friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything that had happened between him and Austin, he felt it would be unfair to Austin if he started chasing after Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Austin had said she didn't need Osborne to take responsibility, wouldn't marry him, and wouldn't meddle in his life, Osborne still felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, since Godfather had already decided on his test, it was impossible to change it. Even if Osborne was reluctant, he had to go through with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and nodded. "Alright. I go it. Go ahead and prepare the fifth test. I'll complete this one quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather silently watched Osborne and ultimately chose not to say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and spoke, "Great danger lies ahead of your path, Osborne. I won't intervene to help you, but I'll give you a few pieces of advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, never let your enemies know all your cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, never hate your enemies. It will cloud your judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Third, people aren't born great. They become great through their experiences and growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope that one day, you will become a great new Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A supreme Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Godfather directly ended the call.</span></p></div>
