        <h1>Chapter 1432 Fully Restored</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the situation unfold, Osborne couldn't help but release a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thank goodness Jeffrey decided to clear out the Deathborn first instead of turning his wrath on him immediately. Even though Osborne was confident he could take Jeffrey down, he knew he wouldn't stand a chance of keeping everyone else there from escaping or sending out a distress signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a bit impulsive earlier, but not a trace of regret crossed his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The native Human Community of Celestara was treated like the lowest of the low within the Wild Flame Army, and while others might tolerate it, Osborne couldn't just sit back and take it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elroy had been the first to provoke him, to insult not just the Human Community but also him personally. There was no way he would apologize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to retaliate, even if it meant damaging his own chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for the moment, everything was back on track. Jeffrey was cautious; even though he was itching to take Osborne down, he was smart enough to recognize that with over a hundred Deathborns still around, he couldn't act on his anger just yet. His priority was to wipe out the Deathborn before settling the score with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did Jeffrey know that once the Deathborn was gone, Osborne's Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would have absorbed enough high-grade death scent to restore much of its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When that happened, Osborne would regain his space and dark elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once those elemental essences were back in play, he would have every confidence in his ability to trap everyone there, not letting a single soul escape or send out a message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne intended to transform them all into members of the Blood Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous roar, the team members of the other squads threw themselves into the fray, each pouring their heart and soul into the fight against the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted nothing more than to eliminate these creatures swiftly so they could watch Jeffrey take Osborne down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such pressure, the Deathborn began to falter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One after another, they fell, even the Transcendent Deity Deathborn succumbing to the collective onslaught, leaving behind the high-grade death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained on the sidelines, choosing not to interfere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having already severed ties with Jeffrey and his crew, he was in no mood to waste his energy. Instead, he watched as they fought, his own Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity quietly absorbing the high-grade death scent in the background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others merely sneered, dismissing Osborne entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, he was as good as dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would bother arguing with a corpse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they didn't know was that deep within Osborne, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was reviving as it absorbed the high-grade death scent left behind by the fallen Transcendent Deity Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once wilted stems began to regain their vitality, teeming with life once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roots had fully recovered, and the stalks started to regain their strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity harnessing its unique energy to restore his dark and space elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fractured powers were quickly stitching themselves back together, and Osborne could hardly contain his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm finally on the verge of regaining my peak strength!" he thought, thrilled at the prospect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back on the Blue Planet, he had broken through to the Superior Deity level, easily dispatching Transcendent Deity warriors. Even those at the pinnacle, like Apocalypse Harbinger, Emperor Dare, Nelson, and Terrence, had found it difficult to withstand his onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, upon entering Celestara, he had inadvertently lost himself in the depths of space, fighting desperately to escape and enhance his powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, his Divine Body had undergone another transformation, akin to reaching Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dark elemental essence surged to mid-Level Six, and his space elemental essence was now at the peak of Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strength had skyrocketed once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At those moments, Osborne believed that even if a Celestial Deity warrior stood before him, he could take them down without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he never got the chance to test his newfound strength before he ran into that terrifying "root" creature, which left him battered and barely clinging to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Divine Body was on the brink of collapse, and his elemental essences were severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Divine Flame that fueled his power had been extinguished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, thanks to his efforts, Osborne was on the verge of reclaiming his peak strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel it&mdash;his Divine Body was about to return to its former glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dark and space elemental essences were set to be fully restored as well, right back to where they belonged!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of Jeffrey and the others, they had taken down a multitude of Superior Deity Deathborns, along with several Transcendent Deity Deathborns. The high-grade death scent they left behind was completely absorbed by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous fist, Jeffrey annihilated the last Deathborn, and in that instant, the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity surged back to life. Although the leaves and flowers were still withered, the plant itself had nearly completely revived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's injuries were also healing at a remarkable pace, aided by the astonishing vitality of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, he appeared unchanged, just as he always had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But inside, he knew just how monumental the transformation had been. There was an incredible and terrifying power brewing within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grin crept onto his face despite himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Finally, I'm fully restored! Now, I've got the means to protect myself in Celestara!" Osborne thought to himself, a sense of newfound confidence coursing through his veins.</span></p></div>
