        <h1>Chapter 2232 Angela's Shock-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was a nervous wreck. There was a hint of worry in her eyes as she nervously awaited Anastasia's answer. She was deathly afraid that Anastasia would reject her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Angela had sent everyone else away. If anyone had seen her like this, they'd have been floored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The normally cool and distant Angela was now looking at Anastasia with desperate longing, praying that Anastasia would say yes to being her disciple. It was a sight that no one could have ever predicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia looked over at Osborne, seeking his advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he gave her an encouraging nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been egging Anastasia on to show off her strength and potential for just this moment, knowing that having Angela as her mentor would be a game-changer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was a real heavy-hitter, even among the Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her as Anastasia's teacher, Anastasia wouldn't just gain a powerful ally; her cultivation journey would also be a whole lot easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne could only provide her with resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it came to the ins and outs of cultivation, he was stumped. He'd never reached Empyrean Sacredness in this life or the last, and he had no clue how to guide Anastasia on her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure thing. Given Anastasia's natural talent, she might eventually manage to break into the Empyrean Sacredness realm all by herself and maybe even stand out among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that road would be full of needless detours and a whole lot of wasted time. Often, those insights that took her hours to figure out could be explained in a jiffy by a seasoned mentor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was still a youngling. The fewer wrong turns she took, the quicker she could climb the cultivation ladder and set herself up for a brighter future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, getting her an Empyrean Sacredness mentor was a must-do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it wasn't just about Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was hoping that Angela wouldn't just take Anastasia under her wing but also give some TLC to Zoe, Kendra, and the others, guiding them along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne said, "Ms. Olsen, hang on a sec! Why don't you check out the rest of our crew before you make up your mind? I reckon Zoe, Kendra, and Bryce have got a ton of potential! Maybe this time, you could think about taking on a few more disciples..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela paused, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly realized that among everyone present, Osborne was the one calling the shots, and everyone was following his lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she felt his suggestion was a bit presumptuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The bar's set pretty high for my personal disciples. Finding Anastasia was like winning the lottery. There's no way someone else here can make me go "Whoa".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You telling me someone can take down a Wooden Golem three cultivation levels above their own, just like Anastasia did? No way I'm buying that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she still gave a nod. "Okay! I'll give it another shot. But listen up, my requirements for personal disciples are no joke! And I </span><span>ain't</span><span> looking to take on a whole </span><span>bunch. Before I met Anastasia, if they could beat a Wooden Golem two levels above theirs, I'd take them on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now... they </span><span>gotta</span><span> beat a Wooden Golem at least three levels above theirs to get me interested!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela figured her conditions would put Osborne off, but all he did was flash a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to Zoe. "Zoe, you're first up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe nodded, her eyes ablaze with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gutsy move!" Angela remarked, waving her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Wooden Golem's cultivation level settled at Ascension Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe took a deep breath, and a fire of resolve sparked in her eyes.</span></p></div>
