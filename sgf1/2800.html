        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed and said, "But I think the biggest beneficiary of opening the Eighth Skyfall Casket would definitely be you. If you break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, would you spare us? Either way, the result is death, so why should I let you take advantage?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You!" Frederick gritted his teeth, his killing intent surging like a tide.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If possible, he wanted to eliminate Osborne immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he knew he couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind Osborne stood Adriana, whose strength was almost equal to his. At this moment, she was highly vigilant. If he made a move, Adriana would undoubtedly strike immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, stopping him for a short time wouldn't be a problem.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne really stepped into that black vortex with the key, it would be too late for him to regret it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Frederick could only forcibly suppress his inner rage and coldly said, "What exactly do you want? Just say it! I know you would never rather die than let me enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There isn't such deep hatred between us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne heard this and sneered inwardly. "Not such deep hatred? No! There definitely is between us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne had no intention of telling Frederick now that he was the same Osborne who was expelled from the palace over a thousand years ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now is not the time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He calmly said, "I don't know what I want to do either. But I think you should show your sincerity first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne's gaze shifted to Callista. "For example, I want you to slap her hard twice right now! If you're willing to do as I say, I&rsquo;ll see your sincerity and might consider opening the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Callista's face instantly turned grim. "What nonsense are you spouting? How dare you try to stir trouble between us as a couple?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Why are you yelling? You almost scared me! Now it seems two slaps aren't enough; it has to be four!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You!" Callista instantly burned with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne completely ignored her anger, merely staring coldly at Frederick and softly saying, "Frederick, show me your sincerity! Slap her hard four times, and maybe I'll consider opening the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's the Skyfall Casket you've long desired."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thousands of years ago, the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet became so powerful because they entered the Ninth Skyfall Casket. Three of them likely broke through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness directly within the Skyfall Casket, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once you reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, you can step onto the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, traveling deeper into the vast universe! In the depths of the universe, the Divine Principle is more complete, allowing you to easily gain greater power and break through to higher cultivation levels."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With your talent, how can you settle for staying at the edge of the universe? It's simply wasting your potential! Even if you venture into the depths of the universe, you'll undoubtedly be the brightest genius. One day, you'll surpass Solomon and become the top ruler and master of this cosmos!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne's voice seemed to carry a bewitching power, making Frederick's breathing grow rapid."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He felt that Osborne seemed to know him very well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What Osborne said was exactly his lifelong dream."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He must break through Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He will step onto the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, venture into the depths of the universe, take his talent there, surpass his ancestors, and become the strongest in the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the key to all this lies in breaking through Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because only by reaching Imperial Empyrean Sacredness can he enter the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign and leave this universe's edge, where spiritual energy is scarce, resources are lacking, and the Divine Principle is incomplete."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He must break through Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And his only hope is to enter the Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, Frederick's eyes were red with excitement."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "As long as I slap her four times, you'll open the Eighth Skyfall Casket?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "Go ahead and slap first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Frederick nodded, then turned his cold, merciless gaze to Callista. "You, come here!"</span></p></div>
