        <h1>Chapter 2456 Notary-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Brenda finished speaking, everyone burst into surprised chatter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why would Brenda be willing to use her Ice Scepter as a bet? That's a Legendary Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne's Warfare Shield and Bloodwrought Bow looked impressive, they were at most Mid-grade Sacred Artifacts, not even considered Superior Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to the Ice Scepter, Osborne's Sacred Artifacts were far inferior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Racial Convergence Planet, the value gap between different grades of Sacred Artifacts is immense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Normally, a basic Inferior Sacred Artifact is worth around one million Sacred Crystals, a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact is close to ten million Sacred Crystals, and a Superior Sacred Artifact is about one hundred million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The value gap between each grade is roughly tenfold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A basic Legendary Sacred Artifact is worth one billion Sacred Crystals, but due to its rarity, even the wealthy may not be able to purchase one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ice Scepter is worth at least one billion Sacred Crystals, possibly even twenty to thirty billion Sacred Crystals, but what about the Bloodwrought Bow and the Warfare Shield?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Shield is a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact. Since it is crafted by the Warfare Ancient Tree, its power rivals that of typical Superior Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it is only worth one hundred million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Bloodwrought Bow is currently just an Inferior Sacred Artifact, worth only a few million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, the value of the Ice Scepter is at least dozens of times that of the Warfare Shield and the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, Brenda still agreed to Osborne's request, using her Ice Scepter as a wager.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is simply a huge loss!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking that Brenda is almost certain to win this bet while Osborne has no chance of winning, they feel very understanding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne might regret it now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He probably suggested using the Ice Scepter as a wager to scare Brenda off. He </span><span>thought</span><span> Brenda wouldn't dare to take the risk, but Brenda has already agreed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, Brenda will definitely win. If it were me, I&rsquo;d agree too. Even if she bets her life, so what? After all, she won&rsquo;t lose, only win!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was talking about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda sneered and looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also thought Osborne suggested using the Ice Scepter as a wager to scare her off. Since she agreed, she believed Osborne already regretted it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, she didn&rsquo;t see a trace of regret on Osborne&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "I must thank you for willingly giving me a Legendary Sacred Artifact. However, words alone are not enough. Someone needs to notarize our bet to ensure that if you lose, you won&rsquo;t go back on your word and refuse to hand over your Ice Scepter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Brenda thought Osborne was still making excuses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought Osborne would soon cancel the bet for failing to find a suitable notary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda sneered and immediately interrupted Osborne, "That's simple! Everyone present is a witness to our bet. If you're worried I'll go back on my word after losing, you can ask the referees. With them as our notaries, you can rest assured, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Brenda pointed to the chief referee Gerald and the others in the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately began to ponder upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda is a top-tier genius disciple of the First-rate Power&mdash;Skyearth Dominion, holding a high status. Although the chief referee Gerald and the others are quite strong, they might not be able to defeat Brenda, and they wouldn't dare to offend Skyearth Dominion easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Brenda refused to hand over the Ice Scepter after losing, the chief referee Gerald and the others wouldn't dare to forcefully do anything to her.</span></p></div>
