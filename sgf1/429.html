        <h1>Chapter 429 Finally Resolved</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brilliant martial art aura erupted, blocking Ryan's dagger and making it impossible for him to harm Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Ryan was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Ryan but Nathan, Kaden, Yulissa, and even the acting family head, Brian, were all frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Martial art aura was the hallmark of a Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help but wonder when did Osborne break through to Class A. No wonder he remained so calm even when Ryan had him pinned down with a dagger at his throat. He had the confidence all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Isaac, who had known all along, showed no surprise at the situation. His eyes were filled with sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ryan hadn't taken Osborne hostage, if he had admitted his mistake earlier, Isaac believed that Osborne might have spared Ryan's life for his sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac closed his eyes, unwilling to witness what would happen next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "Surprised? If I didn't do this, I'd have to waste a 100 million-dollar truth serum on you. Now that you've admitted you're the mole, it's time to go to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In your next life, try to be a better person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne reached out and grabbed the dagger. Ryan didn't stand a chance against Osborne's overwhelming strength. The dagger was snatched away in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the dagger swiftly cut through the air and plunged into Ryan's heart. His eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down at the dagger stabbed in his chest, his face a mix of defiance and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his mouth, but before he could speak, blood began to flow out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's body collapsed to the ground with a thud, his eyes wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac sighed and finally opened his eyes. With tears streaming down his face, he walked over and knelt beside Ryan's lifeless body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His trembling hand gently brushed over Ryan's face, closing his eyes for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isaac, I hope you don't blame me," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His hatred for the Augustine family was too deep. If I had let him go, he would have surely turned to the Paltrow family. I had no choice but to kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac shook his head, his face streaked with tears. "I don't blame you, Osborne. You did what had to be done. If you hadn't been able to, I would've had to do it myself, and that would've been even harder on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's my grandson, the boy I raised. He made a mistake, and I apologize to everyone. It's my fault for not teaching him better," Isaac sobbed, leaving those around him heavy-hearted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan, Kaden, and Queenie exchanged glances, all equally distressed. No one could have imagined that Ryan, who had grown up with them, wasn't actually of the Augustine family bloodline and had long since betrayed the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isaac, please don't say that. This isn't your fault. You've done more than enough. If it weren't for you, the Augustine family would have fallen apart long ago," Yulissa reassured him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wiping his tears, Isaac continued, "Thank you all for your comfort, but I'm fine. No matter what, Ryan is gone now. All the wrongs he committed have vanished with his death. So, I hope to bring him back and bury him alongside his father. I hope you all can agree to this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone fell silent at Isaac's words, their eyes turning to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's intention was to have Ryan buried in the Augustine family's ancestral grounds. However, since Ryan wasn't a blood relative of the Augustine family, he technically wasn't allowed to be buried there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, none of them dared to make a decision, so they looked to Osborne, the heir, for guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had become their pillar, the one who made the call now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac also looked at Osborne, his eyes filled with pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate. There was no way he could refuse a request from a grieving old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and said, "As long as everyone's okay with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one objected, and Isaac took Ryan's body away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they left, the others crowded around Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you scared the crap out of me! I thought you were a goner. When did you become a Class A master? We finally have another one in the Augustine family. You're awesome!" Yulissa's eyes were filled with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan, Kaden, and Queenie shared the same expression, all looking at Osborne with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "I broke through recently. Keep it under wraps, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting casually with them for a bit, Osborne returned to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a deep breath. "Finally tracked down the traitor within the Augustine family. Who knew the first task in the fifth heir's trial would be such a pain in the ass?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had my suspicions about Ryan at first, but his acting threw me off, and I dismissed my doubts. Thankfully, he eventually slipped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, it would've taken a hell of a lot longer to smoke him out! With that mole running loose, my plans could've been seriously screwed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gosh, it's finally resolved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, Osborne began operating the Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fifth heir's trial was divided into three segments. After completing each task, the task could be submitted, though it was unclear if there would be any rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne submitted the first segment of the task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the Draco Star Wristlet provided feedback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations on completing the first part of the fifth heir's trial - identifying the mole within the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rewards are being calculated..."</span></p></div>
