        <h1>Chapter 1026 Launching the Attack</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the vitality flowed into Sebastian's body, his complexion began to brighten, taking on a healthier hue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn&rsquo;t wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, Sebastian's problem wasn't just a lack of vitality; his martial art foundation had been severely compromised, causing a backlash that was eroding his body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't merely a matter of vitality; it was a deep-seated injury that was consuming his very essence, eroding his spirit and soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Osborne would have already used the Light of Redemption to awaken him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed heavily, thinking, "Looks like I'll have to wait until I break through to Class S before I can try using the Light of Redemption on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that doesn't work, Grandpa might be in serious trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression grew grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It&rsquo;s urgent to reach Class S. The pressure of Sebastian's injury, the looming threat of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization and the League of Divine Descent felt like a mountain pressing down on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without breaking through to Class S, Osborne had no hope of overcoming these challenges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had felt Gerardo's incredible strength firsthand. After merging with the god's corpse, Gerardo could wield divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the Godfather's scepter, Osborne knew he wouldn't stand a chance against Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by reaching Class S and combining that power with the scepter could he had some hope to contend with Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it wasn't just Gerardo he had to worry about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization and the League of Divine Descent also had their own top-tier Class S members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Names like Sin, Everett, and even Helios, the patriarch of the Thornberry family, who was known as the strongest on Blue Planet, loomed large in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Sebastian had killed Helios' grandson, Rumen. The Thornberry family wouldn't let the Augustine family off the hook so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen was the vice-leader of the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the sake of reputation, the League of Divine Descent would surely avenge Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty-six Divine Families might dispatch a number of Class S powerhouses, many of whom may be the top-tier Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the pressure mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he remained stuck below Class S, he'd be unable to shake this burden. All the preparations he was making seemed futile without the top-tier combat power he so desperately needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne longed to break through to Class S, but he had to wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was still unconscious, and without her fate power to cleanse and strengthen his body, he was at a standstill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with all his confidence, he knew it would take at least six months to make that leap on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guess I'll just have to wait a bit longer," Osborne muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stepping out of Mount Celestial Reach, Osborne wandered through the Augustine Estate, inspecting the defense system around and checking for any vulnerabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he knew it, he found himself at Mount Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mount Seven was bustling with activity. In light of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' threat, all members of the nine major branch bloodlines had relocated there for safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he ascended to the peak, he arrived at the First Mansion, the residence of the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> branch bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Augustine family knew that Osborne was the former Godfather's grandson, and he had no blood ties to the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> branch bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By all rights, they should have been living in the Ninth Mansion, given their true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, here they were in the First Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne wasn't blood-related to the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> branch bloodline, his connection to them ran deep, perhaps even deeper than his ties to the main bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He often visited the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> branch bloodline to catch up with Isaac, Yulissa, Nathan, and others, offering some guidance on their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this bond, no one dared to provoke the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> branch bloodline. Even members of the main bloodline treated the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> branch bloodline with respect; they understood the significance of Osborne's relationship with those from </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, once again, Osborne found himself back at the First Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! You're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa's eyes sparkled with delight as she rushed to greet him, wrapping her arms around one of his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite everyone now knowing he wasn't her real brother, she still treated him just the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't correct her; it felt natural, and he enjoyed the affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stepped inside, Kendra, Nathan, Queenie, and a few others came over. They were the ones he felt closest to, and the ease of their interaction filled the room with warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled back at them, saying, "Nice to see you all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at you&mdash;everyone's finally broken through to Class A! But this is just the beginning. You have to keep pushing. Aim for Class AAA, okay? If you need resources, just let me know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were met with looks of gratitude and appreciation from the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne's Draco Star Wristlet vibrated violently, catching his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at the screen, and his expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had launched its attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tension gripped him as he prepared to leave, but Kendra gasped suddenly, her face </span><span>pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? My brother's in trouble?"</span></p></div>
