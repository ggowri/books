        <h1>Chapter 2335 Final Showdown-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's voice echoed through the air, Agatha snapped her eyes open in a split-second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rose to her feet, her statuesque figure exuding an air of both grace and might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes swept over Osborne, sizing him up from head to toe, her scrutiny as thorough as a detective on a high-stakes case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the seventh layer, though she could hear Osborne's voice, she hadn't been able to open her eyes to catch a glimpse of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, in a way, this was truly their first face-to-face encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was undeniably good-looking, and a flicker of satisfaction started to stir within her, but she quickly squashed it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I've been waiting for you ages!" Agatha declared, her voice brimming with sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He arched an eyebrow but kept his lips sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instinctively got why Agatha was so eager; after all, they were the only two survivors in the seventh layer during the entire state duel, so she was well-aware of his prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne also took a long, hard look at Agatha's face, trying to read her expression like a book.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">After all, I did take nine drops of her Phoenix Blood... She can't be holding a grudge, can she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alas, her calm demeanor gave nothing away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief moment of thought, he finally spoke up, "I've been itching for this fight too! Let's put an end to this once and for all. Just make sure you bring your A-game."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha nodded vigorously. "You bet! I've whipped myself into shape for this fight. I'm ready to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, she let loose a powerful wave of battle-ready energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick and Benson exchanged quick, knowing looks, a wry smile appearing on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agatha's made up her mind to take on someone else. She thinks we're not up to the mark to be her final foe. Clearly, the one she's gunning for is Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit them like a ton of bricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the state duel started, they all thought they were in the same league. But now, the pecking order of strength was as clear as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha stood head and shoulders above the rest, at least a whole notch stronger than Horace. And Horace, thanks to his Frost-invoking Canvas, had an upper hand over Broderick and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Osborne, his ascent was a real curve-ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just before the state duel, he was outside the top hundred, and no one gave him a snowball's chance in hell of going up against the top four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he'd taken out Benson, Broderick, and Horace one after another, proving that he was the only real thorn in Agatha's side in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her earlier words rang true; she'd seen Osborne's potential from the get-go and had been waiting for this showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with anticipation, not just for Broderick and Benson, but for the millions of folks watching from Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who'd have ever guessed that the showdown for the championship would boil down to Agatha and Osborne? I mean, it ain't Benson, nor Broderick, and definitely not Horace. It's Osborne! Crazy, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who said Osborne didn't stand a chance against Horace, you better step up right now! Horace didn't have a snowball's chance in hell against him. He got taken out with just three arrows! That's how dominant Osborne was."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Horace's so-called best weapon, the Frost-invoking Canvas? It was a dud against Agatha and completely useless against Osborne. It might as well have been a piece of junk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe we all got carried away and overestimated the power of that Frost-invoking Canvas, huh?"</span></p></div>
