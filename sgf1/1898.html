        <h1>Chapter 1897 A Bountiful Harvest</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had left a treasure trove for Jethro in the Dimensional Bag&mdash;over two million Celestial Crystals, more than 200 million Ultimate Essence Crystals, and nearly a hundred Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stash represented nearly everything he had, but Osborne wasn't worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, the divine peak was like an endless vault, a treasure trove ripe for the picking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye had reached Level Ten, granting him the ability to pierce through the mist that shrouded the divine peak, allowing him to spot Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystal Mines from a great distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his spatial power, he could swiftly reach these locations and harvest them with the efficiency of a swarm of locusts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the divine peak was still fraught with danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained cautious, refusing to venture into the core depths where the ominous humanoid statues and root-like creatures lurked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, he could only operate in the outer regions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, that was more than enough. While many powerful warriors tried their luck at the divine peak, their efforts were often futile and inefficient. The outer areas still held plenty of Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystal Mines waiting to be claimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne scanned the South Zone of Divine Peak Ten with his Satan's Eye, he spotted hundreds of Miracle Elixirs and two promising Celestial Crystal Mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jackpot!" he exclaimed, eyes sparkling with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift interdimensional travel, he slipped into the divine peak and quickly made his way to the first patch of Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his spatial power, the Miracle Elixirs were swiftly drawn into his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the Deathborn guardians of the Miracle Elixirs could even react, Osborne vanished, moving on to the next location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had grown adept at this, and the Deathborn patrolling the outer regions, even those at the Deity King level, posed little threat to him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only watch helplessly as he harvested the Miracle Elixirs they were sworn to protect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hours flew by, and soon, a day had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne emerged from the South Zone of Divine Peak Ten, feeling triumphant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything had gone incredibly smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just one day, he had nearly drained all the Miracle Elixirs within a one-hundred-and-twenty-thousand-mile radius of the divine peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone hoping to find more would have to venture deeper into the peak itself, where the density of Miracle Elixirs was higher but fraught with greater peril.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reminded himself, "Sure, there's more treasure deeper in, but I've got to resist the urge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't let greed cloud my judgment. The Miracle Elixirs I've gathered are more than enough for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need to take unnecessary risks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should wait until I become a Supernal Deity King before delving deeper into the divine peak and uncovering its true secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Staying alive is crucial if I want to keep collecting these Miracle Elixirs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought lingering in his mind, Osborne began to tally up his impressive haul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with excitement as he whispered, "A total of sixteen hundred Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Among them, over six hundred are the red ones for boosting cultivation level! More than a hundred yellow ones for enhancing the Divine Body! Three hundred blue ones for elemental essence! And over two hundred black ones for soul power and comprehension! Plus, two hundred white ones for healing wounds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This haul from just one divine peak surpasses what I found at Divine Peak Nine in the East Zone! And this is only the first peak! There are forty-two divine peaks in total across Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If every single one yields similar results, I could end up with over sixty thousand Miracle Elixirs by the time I'm done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the adrenaline pumping through his veins as he began to strategize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "With ten thousand members in the Blood Demon faction, all at the pinnacle of Deity Overlord, they'll need an average of two Miracle Elixirs each to break through to Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's twenty thousand right there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, I can lead them into battle against the Dark Deity Legion to gather blood energy and help them level up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least until they reach the peak of Deity King, they won't need any more Miracle Elixirs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne contemplated how to distribute the Miracle Elixirs wisely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The yellow ones that enhance Divine Body are the rarest. I can't waste them on Blood Demon members. They won't need those for their breakthroughs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those should go to Anastasia and Zoe to help them elevate their Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the blue Miracle Elixirs that boost elemental essence, I can't give those away either! I need them for myself to push my space, dark, and Thunder Powers to Level Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black Miracle Elixirs for soul power and comprehension will also be kept for personal use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That means the Blood Demon members will have to make do with the red and white Miracle Elixirs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a newfound determination, Osborne sorted the Miracle Elixirs by color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The red and white ones were designated for the Blood Demon members, while the yellow, blue, and black ones were reserved for Anastasia and her team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, all of them were at Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these Miracle Elixirs in hand and a hundredfold time acceleration at their disposal, their strength would soar in no time.</span></p></div>
