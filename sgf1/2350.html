        <h1>Chapter 2284 Invitations-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I really have to thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Got it. I appreciate your gratitude. If there's nothing else, I'll get back to my cultivation and get myself in top shape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy knew Osborne was subtly telling her to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a second before adding, "I really owe you one. If you ever need a hand, just say the word. I'll do whatever I can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Really? Then how about this&mdash;leave your current team and help me make it into the top ten. And I won't even pay you a single Sacred Crystal. Would you still do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she shook her head with a wry smile. "To be honest, I would! I know I don't stand a chance of making it into the top ten myself. Since I'm just a sidekick anyway, it doesn't really matter who I'm backing. But my current team was put together by the higher-ups at Azure Haven Academy... I can't just quit, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne burst out laughing. "I was just joking. Don't take it to heart! I don't need your thanks either. If you really want to thank someone, go thank Ms. Olsen! Because it was her who couldn't bear to see you get messed up and told me to wrap up the fight quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy nodded. "Ms. Olsen, eh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll thank her! But I still want to thank you. Anyway, I owe you one..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting a bit more, Leroy took her leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought for a second and quickly grabbed a wooden sign. He scribbled "Already on a team, no more invitations" on it and hung it on the courtyard gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He figured with that sign up, no one would come pestering him to join their team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But much to Osborne's surprise, not long after, there was a knock on the courtyard gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne peeked outside and saw a group of three guys and two girls. He didn't recognize any of them. They'd obviously seen the sign, but they just kept knocking on the door. That made Osborne's brows knit in irritation right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've clearly stated on the sign that I'm not taking any more invitations. So why are they still bugging me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Don't they have any common sense?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was pretty ticked off and didn't want to deal with them. But they just wouldn't stop knocking, like they weren't going to give up. He had no choice but to open the door again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?" Osborne asked, trying hard to hold back his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne opened the gate, the man leading the group spoke up with an air of superiority, "You're Osborne, right? The champion from Tempest Fortress City, ranked 108th on the strength </span><span>leaderboard</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, asking, "Yeah, that's me. What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, with a dismissive tone, said, "Let me introduce myself. I'm Conrad Maurice. I'm here to invite you to join my team. Thirty thousand Sacred Crystals&mdash;what do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed to the wooden sign and replied coolly, "Did you miss the sign? And thirty thousand Sacred Crystals to join your team? Are you joking? The going rate for someone ranked between 100th and 150th is around fifty thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they make it into the top ten, that doubles. Even for those ranked 150th to 200th, it's still around thirty thousand. I'm ranked 108th, and you think thirty thousand is enough to get me on board?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, not interested." With that, Osborne started to close the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another man behind Conrad stepped forward, his voice icy. "Hold it right there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, what's with the attitude? Mr. Maurice is doing you a favor by even considering you for his team. He's ranked 1</span><span>5</span><span>th on the leaderboard. You should be honored he's giving you the time of day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're ranked one hundred and eighth. What's there for you to be proud of? Mr. Maurice personally came to invite you; that's already a solid endorsement! If you play your cards right with him, it could really boost your future prospects!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously, and you're complaining that it's not enough?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you don't know how to appreciate a good offer! All five of us are in the top one hundred of the strength </span><span>leaderboard</span><span>. What makes you so special? How dare you turn down Mr. Maurice? Just so you know, on the state duel battlefield, any one of us could wipe the floor with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man leaned in closer, his gaze piercing, making it clear that Osborne better rethink his stance. It was an unspoken threat&mdash;apologize to Conrad or face the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, couldn't help but chuckle in response to their bravado.</span></p></div>
