        <h1>Chapter 2295 Straight to the Sixth Layer-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest were just taking a shot in the dark, bound to hightail it back to the fifth layer in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Sure, the sixth layer's a real bear, all harsh and dangerous. But a single token there is worth a cool 100 thousand points! That's like finding ten tokens on the fifth layer, a hundred on the fourth, or a thousand on the third...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">As long as I can snag one token on the sixth layer, it'll be a game-changer! 100 thousand points could easily land me a solid spot in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne took a quick peek at the badge on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The digits on his badge had undergone a change. His score remained a big fat zero since he hadn't even started his token-hunting mission, so no points to his name just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his ranking had shifted to 256th.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This little piece of information told him that at least two hundred folks had already managed to find tokens and rack up some points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a gander at the overall leaderboard and was left gobsmacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting pretty at the top was Horace, with a whopping 200 thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In second place were two guys tied&mdash;Broderick and Benson, both with 100 thousand points each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coming in fourth was Conrad, with 60 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The state duel had barely kicked off, and Horace already had 200 thousand points. That could only mean he'd already bagged two tokens from the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick and Benson were also in the thick of it on the sixth layer and had each found a token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad, though, hadn't dipped his toes into the sixth-layer action. He was sticking it out on the fifth layer with his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd already managed to find six tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not half bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stole a glance at the leaderboard, feeling a twitch of restlessness in his gut. He fished out a Sacred Crystal, fired up the Translocator, and poof, he was on the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of Sacred Power burst forth, enveloping him in a defensive shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying storms raging all around him lashed out at his Sacred Power defense like a pack of wild animals. Osborne could feel his Sacred Power draining away at an alarming rate. If he didn't top it up, it'd probably be gone in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most folks needed the help of Sacred Artifacts just to move around freely on the sixth layer. Even Agatha, Horace, and Broderick couldn't rely solely on their Sacred Power for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne? He could keep going like the Energizer Bunny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that his Sacred Power was stronger than those guys. Nah, the real deal was that Osborne didn't give two hoots about the Sacred Power consumption. He had the Chaotic Spiritual Root, firmly planted in the void, constantly pumping fresh Sacred Power into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless the storms here could blow his Sacred Power defense to smithereens in one fell swoop, he was good to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scratched his head for a moment, then whipped out the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he bumped into someone on the sixth layer and they caught wind that he could stand up to the storms using just his Sacred Power, they might start making guesses about his real strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still couldn't go around showing off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Osborne had Satan's Eye, which could sniff out other folks from miles away. He could easily dodge any run-ins if he wanted to. But the Arctic Maw Chasm was no walk in the park. It wasn't just those bone-chilling storms; there were also all sorts of unknown nasties lurking around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Bloodwrought Bow in his grip, Osborne felt a whole lot more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye already in action, Osborne just picked a direction at random and set off on his token-hunting mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, finding those tokens was a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had Satan's Eye at his disposal. With its super vision and X-ray vision, Osborne could scope out a huge area. No matter how well those tokens were hidden, they didn't stand a chance of slipping past his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before Osborne stumbled upon a token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tokens on the sixth layer were these special crystals, usually a deep shade of blue. Each one had a unique symbol etched on it, along with the number "100000".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant a whopping 100 thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pressed the token against his chest badge, and in the blink of an eye, the number showing his score shot up to 100 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ranking on the leaderboard also did a complete 180. Osborne went from being at the bottom of the pack to landing a spot in the top ten right away.</span></p></div>
