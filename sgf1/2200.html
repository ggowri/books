        <h1>Chapter 2185 I Can Sense His Return-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attempting to take my life?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even amidst this dire predicament, Isa maintained an astonishing composure. Her delicate visage showed not a trace of panic; instead, it was etched with an unwavering defiance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're doomed to fail!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Isa unleashed a maelstrom of dark energy. Instantly, the skies above Celestara Planet grew ominously dark, as if an impending tempest was gathering. The surging energy congealed into a colossal black spear, hurtling towards Lord Malevolence with a deadly determination.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! What a futile effort!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Completely unfazed, Lord Malevolence responded with a thunderous punch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark spear shattered into fragments of energy, dissipating like a fading nightmare. He casually shook his hand, a confident smirk on his face. "A millennium ago... Nay, even a century ago, you might've given me a run for my money! You're the very image of the God of Night in his prime&mdash;your power and techniques are virtually indistinguishable!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately for you, I've long since left that level behind!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if your power rivals that of the God of Night at his peak, you're still no match for me. This war that's raged on for over a millennium will end right here and now!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night won't be making an appearance!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His body is riddled with incurable wounds. Without a miracle, he won't be able to break through to a higher cultivation level again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most likely, he's skulking in the shadows, watching you all crumble one by one, too much of a coward to show his face. He knows that even if he did step forward, it would be in vain&mdash;he can't stop me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's petrified! He's abandoned you. I wouldn't be surprised if he's already slunk off to some far-flung corner, far from Celestara Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a derisive laugh, Lord Malevolence suddenly lunged at Isa. In the blink of an eye, he was right before her, his hand closing tightly around her throat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shocked gasps rippled through the onlookers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, and the others went deathly pale. Their hearts pounded in their chests as they watched Lord Malevolence tighten his grip. It seemed as if the next second could be Isa's last, and panic welled up within them like a wildfire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Isa remained unfazed; she even smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence furrowed his brow, confusion etched on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've already defeated her, and have her in my grasp, so why is she still smiling?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That unsettling thought crept into his mind. He scanned the surroundings carefully, not sensing any threat, and allowed himself to relax slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little girl, what's so funny?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa met his gaze with calm defiance. "I'm laughing at how long you've been the God of Night's adversary, yet you still don't understand him! How could he possibly be afraid? How could he abandon us and run away?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scoffed, her disdain evident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he wanted to escape, he would've done so a thousand years ago!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he wanted to flee, he could have done it a hundred years ago! You don't know him at all!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa flashed a tranquil smile and added, "He's returning! I can sense it deep within... he's making his way back!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's visage clouded over instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A volatile blend of seething rage and sheer desperation coursed through him, compelling his hand to clench ever-tighter around Isa's throat. Nevertheless, Isa remained the picture of composure. Her features were as steady as a rock, radiating an air of quiet pride and an unwavering resolve that nothing could break.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence scoffed with blatant disdain, saying, "Even if he does return, it's all in vain. Do you truly believe he stands a chance against me? The injuries festering within him are beyond redemption. His cultivation level has hit a dead-end at Ascension Nine and will never progress. He's nothing but a spent force now. There's not a thing he can do to stop me from resurrecting the Malevolence Empire on Celestara Planet!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, even if he returns, he'll just have to watch as I wipe you all out, slaughter the local Human Community, and then... I'll finish him off!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa couldn't help but chuckle, shaking her head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's expression darkened. "What's so funny now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied, "I'm laughing at how naive you are! None of your imagined outcomes will come to pass! You won't kill us, and you won't have a chance to rebuild your Malevolence Empire, let alone kill him!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence, you should be grateful that the God of Night has those wounds; otherwise, you wouldn't even be worthy to face him! If he weren't injured, you would have been dead the moment you set foot on Celestara Planet a thousand years ago!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And right now... I can feel him coming back!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your good times are about to end!"</span></p></div>
