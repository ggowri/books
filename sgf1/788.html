        <h1>Chapter 788 Humiliation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, a terrifying force suddenly pressed down on the group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their expressions changed instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An&nbsp;S-class Supreme Overlord!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson family's&nbsp;S-class Supreme Overlord&nbsp;coldly stared at them, saying, "If you dare to disrupt the Honor Quest Ceremony again, don't blame us for being ruthless!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get out of here, now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you aren't satisfied, let your young generation take revenge on the arena, fair and square. You can severely injure Cuthbert, and no one will stop you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But can the young generation of the Lambert family even do that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson family's&nbsp;S-class Supreme Overlord&nbsp;sneered as he looked at the Lambert family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Laughter erupted from the crowd, and everyone sneered at the Lambert family with mocking looks on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Lambert family probably won't even get to settle this grudge!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Their younger generation, trying to beat&nbsp;Cuthbert? They must be dreaming! They probably won't even dare to challenge him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Haha, but don't be so sure about that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't forget about&nbsp;Axell. He's already on the&nbsp;Godson Rankings. According to the rules, he must challenge&nbsp;Cuthbert&nbsp;in the arena."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When that happens, he might be the next one severely injured by&nbsp;Cuthbert!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is going to be entertaining."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The taunting from the crowd made the Lambert family's expressions darken with embarrassment.&nbsp;Stuart, fuming with rage, was about to speak up, but&nbsp;Aleena stopped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We'll go back first," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a wave of her hand, she used her power to support&nbsp;Rhett's&nbsp;injured body, bringing him back to the seating area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, that was pitiful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose mocked. "If you don't have the strength, don't go up there and embarrass yourselves! Now you regret it, don't you? Not only did you humiliate yourselves, but you also ended up so severely injured. Even if you recover, you'll never return to your peak."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose's words made the Lambert family even more furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mose, this is your doing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart&nbsp;gritted his teeth. "The&nbsp;Eityreia Organization&nbsp;is definitely in deep with the Williamson family! You've had&nbsp;Cuthbert&nbsp;deal with Rhett so viciously, haven't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose shrugged indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And what if it was? What can you do about it? You're so weakling that even if there were ten of you, it wouldn't be enough for me to kill!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose mocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart was livid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough! We need to focus on getting&nbsp;Rhett&nbsp;treated first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;quickly pulled Stuart back, afraid that he'd act out of anger and fall into Mose's trap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart immediately calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Mose's provocation, he realized that if he had acted rashly, he would've broken the rules again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that case, even if Mose killed him, the Williamson family wouldn't stop him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a fierce glare at Mose, Stuart turned his attention to&nbsp;Rhett.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose, seeing that Stuart had managed to control his rage, appeared disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pathetic. You're nothing but a coward. You're filled with anger yet too scared to do anything about it. What's the point of living if you're this useless? You're just wasting food and air!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, however, Stuart controlled his emotions. Though his face turned red with anger, he didn't respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;also ignored Mose and instead focused on Rhett's badly injured body, his expression serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett's injuries were too severe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert&nbsp;had been too vicious. He had barely spared Rhett's life. If these wounds weren't treated properly, Rhett's future was ruined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For the rest of his life, Rhett would never reach his peak again, let alone make any breakthroughs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;was seething with rage at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Osborne wasn't truly part of the Lambert family and had no personal bond with Rhett, seeing&nbsp;Cuthbert&nbsp;injure Rhett so brutally filled him with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aleena, take him back to the courtyard. I can heal him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne spoke, Aleena trembled in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, without questioning Osborne, she quickly nodded and helped carry Rhett's broken body back to the courtyard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne hurried after them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, they reached the courtyard. Aleena gently placed Rhett on the bed, but his blood immediately stained the sheets red. Tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, how are you going to heal him?" Aleena asked, her voice full of concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that there was no one else around, Aleena addressed him by his real name, dropping the pretense of calling him "Axell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne calmly replied, "Just watch and you'll see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without another word, Osborne suddenly activated the&nbsp;Light Realm, enveloping the entire courtyard in radiant energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Light Realm?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena gasped, "Osborne, you've mastered not just the&nbsp;Spatial Domain, but the&nbsp;Light Realm&nbsp;too? And it seems even stronger than your&nbsp;Spatial Domain!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena was utterly shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the prodigies on the&nbsp;Godson Rankings&nbsp;mostly only mastered one domain, as mastering multiple was nearly impossible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only a few exceptional individuals had managed to master two domains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Osborne had mastered two as well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled lightly. If Aleena knew he had actually mastered four domains, it would surely leave her speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without elaborating further, Osborne quickly harnessed the power of light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Light of Redemption!"</p></div>
