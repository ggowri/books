        <h1>Chapter 189 Convincing Donna</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked gratefully at Osborne before turning her hopeful eyes to Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was right. Donna's support was crucial to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Clarissa's young age, Donna had been assigned by the Radcliffe family to protect her and had spent more time with her than her own parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to certain reasons, Clarissa couldn't stay at the Radcliffe Manor as it would bring misfortune to the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she moved to the grand manor in Mayby City, with only Donna as her constant companion and family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie," Clarissa called softly, biting her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gentle voice snapped Donna out of her reverie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If even you don't support me, then I have no one left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's body trembled slightly as she sighed deeply. Her eyes, filled with tenderness, misted over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. I know what to do. I respect your decision, and I support you. Even though I believe the path you're about to take is a dead end, an impossible one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if it makes you happy, I will support you. No matter the storm that follows, I will stand in front of you and shield you from everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's eyes reddened, and tears welled up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked over to Donna and embraced her gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Auntie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna held her tightly, her face full of warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she let go and shot a fierce look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I should never have let you join the Radcliffe family. I knew from the start you had ulterior motives concerning Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne awkwardly scratched his nose at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna continued, "But what's done is done. You must take good care of Clarissa from now on. No matter what the future holds, as long as you are alive, you must protect and care for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I ever find out that you've let her down, I will haunt you even from the grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Donna Radcliffe, I will take care of Clarissa and ensure she never suffers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna finally nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna thought for a moment before continuing, "So, what's the plan? Clarissa, what are you going to do about your engagement to Apollo? And your parents, your grandfather..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna sighed deeply, feeling the weight of the obstacles they were about to face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The engagement between Clarissa and Apollo seemed like an insurmountable barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo would not give up easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the most renowned prophet in Rosmandi, marrying Clarissa, the Radcliffe family's Fatebearer would allow Apollo to ascend to great heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one doubted this prophecy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Apollo discovered that Clarissa wanted to break off their engagement to be with Osborne, he would undoubtedly react with fury, and so would his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Clarissa exchanged a look, and he spoke up, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, don't worry. I'll handle the engagement with Apollo. If I can't resolve it peacefully, then I'll deal with him directly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were cold and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Osborne implying he would take Apollo out if necessary?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where do you get this confidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned. "Apollo is a B-level metahuman. Even if we teamed up, we wouldn't stand a chance. He's surrounded by powerful allies and backed by a formidable family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "That doesn't concern me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna stared at him, stunned by his confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face showed skepticism and doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa wanted to reassure her aunt about Osborne's real background. He was the secret owner of Skyefall Security, and he had significant power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing Osborne's reluctance to reveal his identity, she held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie, trust us. Since we've decided to be together, we wouldn't take such risks if we weren't sure of our plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I believe in Osborne!" Clarissa said, squeezing Osborne's hand tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna felt helpless. "Do as you wish, then! You have no idea how powerful Apollo and his family are.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tonight, there's a big match between Chevalier Security and Skyefall Security. Apollo will be there. You'll see for yourselves how formidable he is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe after tonight, you won't be so optimistic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes gleamed with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or perhaps after tonight, Apollo will be out of the picture, and he'll no longer be a threat," he said calmly.</span></p></div>
