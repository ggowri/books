        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the God of Light spoke up, "Regardless of how it happened, this is a blessing for the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before the full-scale war begins, we've managed to root out the pests&mdash;the Baxter and Faulkner families&mdash;who had long betrayed us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words sent a ripple of murmurs through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks to the esteemed God of Light for uncovering their treachery ahead of time! Imagine if we had been in a full-blown battle with the Dark Deity Legion and those two suddenly turned on us, leaking our intel to the Paramount Supreme Clan or even staging a surprise attack from behind! The losses would have been catastrophic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Our resistance could have been crushed because of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those traitors deserved their fate! The Baxter and Faulkner families should be wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! Hail to the esteemed God of Light! Your might is unmatched!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in praise, their spirits lifted by the God of Light's decisive actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder we've been surrounded by the Dark Deity Legion on the border battlefield all these years! Those traitors sold us out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, esteemed God of Light, for dealing with the betrayers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light opened her mouth, ready to clarify that she hadn't discovered their betrayal, nor had she been the one to eliminate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she held her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "A mysterious force within the Human Community, huh? Regardless, this unseen ally has done us a tremendous favor by taking care of the Baxter and Faulkner families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they want to stay hidden, I'll keep their secret. Let the Paramount Supreme Clan believe that it was my doing; it works in our favor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, the God of Light addressed the assembly again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Let's put this matter aside! I'll provide you with the evidence of their betrayal later so you can review it at your leisure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For now, we need to discuss something else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paramount Supreme Clan has agreed to a contest on the border battlefield!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A serious atmosphere settled over the room, even Jethro appeared unusually focused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? The Paramount Supreme Clan really agreed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do they have any other demands?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are the specific rules?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light replied calmly, "The rules for the contest are straightforward! It will officially commence in seven days! Each day, there will be eight matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For every match the Human Community loses, we must retreat 600 thousand miles. Conversely, for every match we win, the Paramount Supreme Clan will also retreat 600 thousand miles."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned silence enveloped the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, someone echoed, "Eight matches a day? If we lose one, we have to retreat 600 thousand miles? And if we win, they'll do the same?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders exchanged anxious glances, the weight of the situation sinking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about the rules? Are there any restrictions for the eight matches?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light nodded quickly. "Of course, there are restrictions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each match will have a cultivation level limit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll be pitting warriors of eight different cultivation levels against each other: Transcendent Deity, Celestial Deity, Deity Overlord, Deity King, and the Ascension levels&mdash;One, Two, Three, and Four Supernal Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the first match, both the Human Community and the Paramount Supreme Clan will select 10 thousand Transcendent Deity warriors to compete! Victory will be determined only when one side is completely wiped out or surrenders!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The winners advance 600 thousand miles, while the losers retreat 600 thousand miles...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the second match, the Human Community and the Paramount Supreme Clan will each choose ten thousand Celestial Deity warriors to face off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the third match, we'll pit ten thousand Deity Overlord warriors against each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the fourth match, ten thousand Deity King-level warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the fifth, 100 Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the sixth, 100 Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the seventh, 100 Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And finally, in the eighth match, 10 Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings will compete!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Essentially, we'll have eight matches every day until one side is completely overwhelmed, or until one side has no warriors left to fight and surrenders!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Warriors of lower cultivation levels can still participate in higher-level matches if they're confident in their abilities! For instance, a Deity Overlord warrior can take on a Deity King warrior, and an Ascension One Supernal Deity King can challenge an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King. However, those at higher cultivation levels cannot compete in lower-level matches!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In any case, the challenge will officially begin in seven days! If we want to stall the Dark Deity Legion and buy ourselves some time, we need to secure as many victories as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I want each of you to return and select the top talents from your families. Anyone above Transcendent Deity level who has the ability to challenge higher levels needs to be accounted for, trained, and ready to fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the God of Light finished speaking, a heavy silence settled over the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro furrowed his brow. "Esteemed God of Light, isn't the wager for this contest a bit too steep? Retreating 600 thousand miles for every loss... The gap in strength between the Human Community and the Paramount Supreme Clan is still significant. If we lose all eight matches in a day, we'd be forced to retreat 4.8 million miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this rate, we'll quickly find ourselves with no ground left to stand on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nods of agreement rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light replied coolly, "Then we'd better fight tooth and nail to win! As long as we don't lose, we won't have to retreat! Do you really want to face the Dark Deity Legion head-on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think about the casualties we'd suffer in a direct confrontation! Are you sure the Dark Deity Legion won't advance faster than 4.8 million miles every day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hung in the air, leaving the leaders in contemplative silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light continued, "The border competition is advantageous for us! Our main goal is to buy time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can delay the inevitable with minimal losses, that's more than enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, if we can snag a few victories along the way, it'll boost the morale of the Human Community significantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The border competition has been confirmed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we don't participate, the Paramount Supreme Clan will unleash the Dark Deity Legion on us in full force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That would make our situation even more dire! So, go back and prepare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gather the talents at each cultivation level; the Human Community needs their contributions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" one responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the Dukedom Level Powers wore serious expressions. They knew that those who entered the border competition might not return, given the overwhelming strength of the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to buy time for the Human Community, they had no choice but to send their best and brightest into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, everyone dispersed from the Sanctum of Light, each returning to their respective families to prepare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro made his way back to the Hudson Manor and immediately contacted Osborne to relay the news about the upcoming border competition in seven days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but be taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Eight matches in the border competition?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one at a different cultivation level? Winning for the Human Community is going to be tough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... I can participate..."</span></p></div>
