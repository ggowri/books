        <h1>Chapter 1417 Go to Wild Flame City</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't anticipated that Harry and Amelia would be so resolute. The moment they saw "Lachlan," they chose to take their own lives without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This showed just how tarnished Lachlan's reputation must be among the humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia would rather die than fall into Lachlan's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they prepared to end it all, Osborne sprang into action, unleashing a surge of divine power that bound their hands, preventing them from striking down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of Osborne's strength, Harry, an Intermediate Deity, and Amelia, merely a Junior Deity, found themselves utterly powerless to follow through with their desperate act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair filled their eyes as they exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry, Amelia, don't be rash&mdash;it's me!" Osborne called out, his true voice breaking through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia froze, astonishment washing over their faces when they recognized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then swiftly reverted the facial contours back to their original appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne?!" they exclaimed, disbelief twisting into a blend of surprise and hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really me!" Osborne smiled gently, quickly explaining his situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm planning to disguise myself as Lachlan and infiltrate the Wild Flame City, joining the Ninth Dark Deity Legion's Wild Flame Army."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia stared at him, completely taken aback. "What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you actually killed Lachlan? And now you want to impersonate him? That's incredibly dangerous! What if someone sees through your disguise? You'd be done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concern was evident in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, his confidence unwavering. "Don't worry. I have some unique methods to ensure that no one will see through my ruse&mdash;not even those who know Lachlan best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry tilted his head, still skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? You're sure about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry pressed, his brow furrowing. "Why are you doing this, Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems way too dangerous for what little gain there is. Can you explain your reasoning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment before shaking his head. "I can't go into details right now. All I can say is my choice is driven by a desire to help the human race in the East Zone survive better, to lessen their suffering."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's whole demeanor shifted at that, his eyes lighting up with a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the very dream he'd always harbored but felt powerless to pursue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he doubted Osborne could pull it off, he was more than willing to support him in this bold endeavor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you need from us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied with a warm smile, "You might have to play the part of my 'captives'&mdash;even 'slaves.' That's the only way I can sneak you out of the mines and take you to Wild Flame City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gazes met, and they quickly grasped the necessity behind Osborne's plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They nodded resolutely. "Thank you, Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't even have to tell us why, let alone bring us along to Wild Flame City. Honestly, it would've been easier for you to eliminate us. But you chose to trust us. Thank you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We won't let you down. We won't betray you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their resolve was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not get too serious, okay? If everything goes as planned, we should be in the clear. Now, let's get moving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia nodded, excitement creeping into their expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wild Flame City! That's one of the three mega-cities in the East Zone. We've never been out of the Rodriguez Village; our entire lives were spent within the mining district, never daring to venture further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, we're actually leaving Rodriguez Village for Wild Flame City!" Harry and Amelia spoke with unmistakable anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated upon hearing Rodriguez Village mentioned, but finally decided to divulge. "Harry, Amelia. I have some news for you. Rodriguez Village... it's gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia stood frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rodriguez Village is gone? Did Lachlan do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded somberly. Having absorbed Lachlan's memories, he knew it was Lachlan who had ordered the massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of sorrow crossed the eyes of Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry murmured, "It's just... gone. The villagers were cold and numb, but it was all out of necessity. Despite everything, we were part of the village. Hearing they're all dead... it hurts. I just hope such a tragedy never happens again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their spirits dampened, and the siblings fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne refrained from offering comfort, swiftly moving to gather them with Albert and Laird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry, Amelia, bear with the temporary hardship," Osborne said, using divine power to restrain their limbs, feigning them as captives, and then whisking them away from the mining zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With direction confirmed, Osborne led the group towards Wild Flame City&mdash;one of the three main cities of the East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long afterward, they drew near the outskirts of Wild Flame City.</span></p></div>
