        <h1>Chapter 2550 I Will Avenge Him-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nebula City, the largest city in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, is incredibly prosperous and bustling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the First-rate Powers of the Glorious Divine Kingdom have bases in Nebula City. Even some forces of the Evernight Court have bases in Nebula City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairy Moon Sect also has a base in Nebula City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne walked out of Nebula City's Cosmic Translocator and immediately contacted Angela, but unfortunately, Angela was still at Fairy Moon Sect and would take some time to arrive in Nebula City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela asked Osborne to go to Fairy Moon Sect's base and stay there temporarily, but Osborne refused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time coming to Nebula City, he planned to start his revenge. Staying at Fairy Moon Sect's base now could easily implicate Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, he was very familiar with Nebula City, so finding a place to stay was easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nebula City is divided into the Palace, the Inner City, and the Outer City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For ordinary people, the Palace is a forbidden area, the residence of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family. Even members of the Royal Family's branch bloodline or high-ranking generals and officials of the Glorious Divine Kingdom can only enter when summoned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Inner City is mostly inhabited by members of the Royal Family's branch bloodline, various officials, high-ranking generals, wealthy merchants, and warriors from major forces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was originally a disciple of Mystic Sirius Sect and could only live in the Outer City of Nebula City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he stood out in the zone duel and became the champion of Eastern Zone 3, so as long as he presented the Kingdom Duel Badge, he could enter the Inner City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne hesitated and chose not to do so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once he presented the Kingdom Duel Badge, many people would likely know he had arrived in Nebula City, and the over 46 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints on his badge would be exposed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nebula City is not absolutely safe either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once his identity and wealth are exposed, there's no guarantee someone won't take the risk to target him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, before the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel begins, he needs to hide his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he also doesn't want to live in the Outer City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Outer City is more chaotic, and he can hardly see his enemies there. Osborne wants to enter the Inner City. Once inside the Inner City, with his Satan's Eye, he can even observe the situation inside the Palace, and perhaps even...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He can see the situation inside the Royal Sepulcher!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luckily, I know a way to enter the Inner City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne arrived at a hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying a few words to the hotel staff, Osborne was taken to a private room. Shortly after, a hotel manager appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to enter the Inner City?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man got straight to the point and said, his eyes boldly sizing up Osborne. However, Osborne had the Sublime Concealment Orb, which altered his appearance and aura, so he wasn't worried about being recognized.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said calmly, "I heard you have a way to get people into the Inner City, so I came."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man didn't notice anything and nodded, saying, "First, tell me your identity! The Glorious Divine Kingdom's once-in-a-decade sacrificial ceremony is approaching, and right now, the Glorious Divine Kingdom has very strict defenses around Nebula City. It's extremely difficult for anyone without a proper identity to enter the Inner City."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're a spy from the Evernight Court or looking for a chance to disrupt the sacrificial ceremony, sending you in would be trouble if discovered."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne heard this and smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not a spy from the Evernight Court! Although I can't reveal my true identity, I can tell you who referred me!"</span></p></div>
