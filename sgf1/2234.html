        <h1>Chapter 2210 Past-life Memories-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Annie, you've been through a lot these years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Anita stood stock-still, her eyes popping open in shock. Unable to contain her emotions any longer, tears started to pour down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, you're finally back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, she rushed into Osborne's arms, her heart brimming with a mix of joy and relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A millennium had elapsed since the fateful battle against Lord Malevolence. Over that </span><span>long period, Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and even Ophelia had passed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anita was the sole survivor, having remained by Osborne's side with unwavering loyalty, taking care of him through the endless years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been his most devoted attendant, the one who had accompanied him for the longest time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Osborne entered the cycle of reincarnation, all his memories were wiped clean. Thanks to the Orb of Reincarnation, he crossed paths with Clarissa, Austin, Emma, and even Isa on Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Anita, who had been safeguarding the West Zone of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet to protect the Human Community, had become a complete stranger to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as Osborne retrieved the memories of his past life, he finally recognized her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he addressed her as "Annie", Anita could no longer hold back her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh. He let Anita hug him tightly and gently patted her on the back. "I'm truly sorry for everything you've endured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he got to his feet. His eyes suddenly blazed with a fierce intensity, which soon gave way to an unsettling calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others exchanged looks, sensing a distinct change in Osborne's demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't seem to simply return to his former self; rather, he appeared more imposing and in control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they kept their thoughts to themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was silent for a moment. Then he held out his hand, revealing a dazzling orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Orb of Reincarnation, a Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, this Sacred Artifact didn't possess any powerful offensive or defensive capabilities. Its sole function was to subtly influence the cycle of reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was through the Orb that Osborne was able to bring Clarissa, Emma, and the others back so swiftly, and it was also the reason for his own rapid rise in power during this lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything had been meticulously arranged using the Orb of Reincarnation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, his encounter with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity in this life wasn't just a stroke of luck; it had been predetermined in his previous life. Osborne had already pinpointed the location of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity long before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By using the Orb of Reincarnation, he had orchestrated the events of his rebirth, allowing him to cross paths with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity at that crucial moment and obtain it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounded almost mystical, but that was the true power of the Orb of Reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could also be seen as a manipulation of fate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to these preordained arrangements, Osborne was "destined" to marry Ophelia, to encounter Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Isa, and to fall in love with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also "fated' to meet the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was set in motion long before in the Orb of Reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an incredible Orb of Reincarnation!" Osborne couldn't help but exclaim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just for its ability to influence the cycle of reincarnation, the orb deserved its title as a Sacred Artifact, even if it lacked any offensive or defensive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the Orb for a long time before finally putting it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget about the Creation Herald for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he finds out I possess the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, he won't tell anyone. He'll just bide his time, waiting until he's strong enough to try and take it from me. But right now, he's not even close to being able to challenge me. That's why he destroyed the divine peak and fled from </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect he's planning to wait until he breaks through to Empyrean Sacredness before making a move on my Ascending Sacred Sanctum. But by then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept across Osborne's face as he continued, "By then, who knows if it'll be him trying to take from me or me taking from him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned to the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's head back! Next, I want to find my parents in this life... and then, I'll make my way to Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p></div>
