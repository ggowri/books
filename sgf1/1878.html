        <h1>Chapter 1877 The Confession</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary looked at Osborne and said, "You're the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community, right? I should have figured it out sooner. The leader's name is Theodore Augustine, and you've also gone by that name before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore, one of the Seven Young Deity Kings, wields both spatial and dark powers. We didn't think much of it when you used Thunder Power because it's rare for one person to master three powers at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now I'm certain. Theodore, one of the Seven Young Deity Kings, is you. Plus, with another member named Vivienne Augustine among them, my suspicions are even more solidified!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did this on purpose, didn't you? You used their names in hopes of finding your parents, trying to make their names known in Celestara, waiting for them to come looking for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary pieced everything together, feeling a mix of excitement, relief, and deep melancholy over his defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Virgil's help, they couldn't stand up to Osborne, who was only a mid-level Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's uncle, this realization left Zachary frustrated, especially remembering how he had confidently declared yesterday that he would protect Osborne and that Osborne could always turn to him for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on it now made Zachary feel embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a small smile. When he agreed to battle Zachary, he anticipated this outcome and the exposure of his identity as one of the Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded. "Uncle Zachary, you're right. I am indeed Theodore, the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings. I'm not hiding it on purpose; I just haven't had the chance to say it until now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary managed a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil's eyes widened. He had been upset over losing to Osborne, but his mood lifted significantly when he learned Osborne was the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked excitedly, "Is it true, Osborne? Are you really the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings? Did you really kill Caesar?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, responding honestly, "To be fair, Caesar wasn't defeated by me directly. His Supreme Sovereign's Armor was tougher than the Ultimate Luminous Armor, and I couldn't penetrate his defenses at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, it was my sister Zoe who utilized my soul power to launch a soul attack that managed to defeat him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nonetheless, Virgil was beyond excited. "So, you're the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings. That's amazing! You have no idea how popular your name is among the higher-ups in the Human Community. Even the God of Light is impressed by you. I can accept that I lost to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary shot him a glare. "What do you mean 'accept'? Your level is higher than Osborne's, and you've trained longer&mdash;yet you're still okay with losing? Go home and practice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil rolled his eyes. "Come on, Dad, you lost too. You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Zachary gave him a light slap on the forehead. "How dare you talk back? Get out of here! And remember, don't breathe a word about Osborne being the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings. He's killed Caesar&mdash;a member of the Five Brilliant Scions of the Paramount Supreme Clan, and that's put him in serious danger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are many people in our Human Community who have defected to the Paramount Supreme Clan. If they find out the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings is in the Hudson family, not only will Osborne be at risk, but the Hudson family will be, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's expression was grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil immediately sobered up, nodding earnestly. "Don't worry, Dad. I understand how serious this is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary turned his attention back to Osborne. "Osborne, be honest with me. Is Theodore at Astral Wolf Peak you? If I recall correctly, if you've mastered spatial power to a high level, you can use a secret technique called Space Clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you mastered Space Clone? Is the Theodore at Astral Wolf Peak just a clone? You left your real body with the Hudson family while your clone went to trade with Trevor? That's clever of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked a bit sheepish at that. "Uncle Zachary, I have indeed mastered Space Clone. But the person standing in front of you is the clone. My real body is near Astral Wolf Peak, and the one on top of Astral Wolf Peak is also a clone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's anxiety spiked. "Your real body is over there, too? That's incredibly risky! Trevor is the Supernal Deity King! Even with your spatial power, that's still dangerous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring your real body back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed Zachary's worry and felt touched but shook his head. "Uncle Zachary, it's too late. Trevor is already here. I can't explain it right now; I need to deal with him first."</span></p></div>
