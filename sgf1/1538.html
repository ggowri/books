        <h1>Chapter 1537 Ambush</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron and Sara were equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone was actually breaking through to a new realm in the Royston family's Essence Crystal mine?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to make matters worse, he seemed to be from the Paramount Supreme Clan, just like Tobey?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exclaimed in unison, "Mr. Tobey Bowman, we don't know this guy! He's definitely not one of ours; we've never seen him before! Look closely&mdash;he's from the Paramount Supreme Clan too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey paused, momentarily caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paramount Supreme Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He narrowed his eyes at Osborne. Then, his expression shifted dramatically. "What do you mean, Paramount Supreme Clan? I don't recognize him. I can guarantee you that he's not from our ranks! Our clan is small enough as it is&mdash;I'd never confuse one of our own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them shared anxious glances, the implications of their findings sinking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wasn't from the Royston family and not part of the Paramount Supreme Clan, then he had to be part of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron's face went pale. "Damn it, that's a lowly human!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How the hell did he get into our Essence Crystal mine? What's he doing here? Could he have been hiding out and mining our top-grade Essence Crystals for his own cultivation?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought weighed heavily on him, his expression darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now he's on the verge of breaking through to Deity Overlord? Just how much of our Essence Crystal has he stolen? This is infuriating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey couldn't help but smirk. "He certainly deserves what's coming to him! A petty human hiding in an abandoned mine, trying to break through to Deity Overlord! If we hadn't stumbled onto this, there would've been another Deity Overlord warrior from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're all worthless, and their pretense of submission is just that&mdash;a pretense! One day, they'll rise up against us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a dead meat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice dripped with venom as he turned to them. "While he's in the middle of his breakthrough, you two need to act immediately. Take him out while he's vulnerable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravity of Tobey's words hung in the air, and Myron and Sara exchanged worried glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron protested uneasily, "Mr. Tobey Bowman, he's in the midst of breaking through </span><span>to Deity Overlord. He looks like he's nearly finished, and his strength may well exceed ours combined!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! What's there to fear? You've got me backing you up! Besides, right now, he's putting all his focus into his breakthrough. He's at his slowest reaction time, which makes this the perfect moment to strike! Until he completes his breakthrough, he's still just a peak Celestial Deity&mdash;not a Deity Overlord yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are both peak Celestial Deities as well, from the Upper Race's Demonic Dragon Clan. Are you really scared of a lowly human?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone turned sharp, eyes glinting with authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now quit wasting time and do as I say. That's an order!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the weight of his demand, Myron and Sara gritted their teeth, taking a deep breath as they slowly crept closer to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Tobey was right&mdash;Osborne was entirely focused on his breakthrough, oblivious to their approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no inkling that someone would dare to encroach upon his space in such a deserted mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Myron and Sara closed the distance to within a hundred yards, Osborne finally sensed the murderous intent radiating from them. Alarm bells rang in his mind, snapping him out of his trance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes shot open, piercing the darkness with a newfound clarity, just in time to catch a glimpse of his attackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Myron and Sara realized their cover had been blown. They unleashed their pent-up energies, launching their strikes without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" they shouted in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Myron and Sara, as peak Celestial Deities from the renowned Demonic Dragon Clan, possessed strength that surpassed typical warriors of their level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their unleashed attack was a terrifying force, closing in on Osborne in an instant as he remained caught in the throes of his breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With little time to react and unable to evade their onslaught, Osborne instinctively channeled his energy into </span><span>Thunderform</span><span> Flash, enveloping himself in crackling electricity for protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two overwhelming attacks crashed into him, shattering the electric barrier surrounding him and hurling his body against the cavern wall with a deafening impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spilled from the corner of Osborne's mouth as he staggered from the force of the blow, pain searing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't panic; in that fleeting moment, he felt the surge of energy within him solidify into a new state. He had completed his breakthrough and officially became a Transcendent Deity warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Springing to his feet, Osborne wiped the blood from his lips, his eyes narrowing into frosty slits as he fixed his gaze on Myron and Sara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're looking for trouble," he said coldly, a fierce energy radiating from him as the lightning swirled around his body once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with his newfound power, and the atmosphere shifted dramatically, sending a chill down the spines of both attackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron and Sara exchanged panicked glances. "This is bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's still alive?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He completed his breakthrough? This is going downhill fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the realization sank in, Myron glanced back at Tobey, seeking guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey scoffed, irritation flashing across his features. "Pathetic! What are you two </span><span>afraid of?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You couldn't even pull off a simple ambush! But it looks like his breakthrough wasn't entirely successful&mdash;he still has only five Divine Flames above his head, which means he hasn't ascended to Deity Overlord yet! He's as good as dead!"</span></p></div>
