        <h1>Chapter 802 Admit Defeat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a cruel grin, Osborne pressed his foot down hard on Cuthbert's head, grinding it into the rough surface of the arena.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's face was pressed against the unforgiving ground, and blood immediately began to flow, his low, guttural cries of pain sending shivers through the crowd.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The members of the Williamson family were outraged.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They rose to their feet, eyes bloodshot with boiling rage as they fixed their gaze on Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You deserve to die!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They growled through gritted teeth, some even lunging towards the arena in a desperate attempt to save Cuthbert.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert was the hope of the Williamson family, the most talented disciple they had seen in centuries.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had placed their utmost faith in him, offering a divine artifact and an astonishing reward of 500 billion as part of the Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their aim was to help Cuthbert build an unstoppable momentum, to propel him towards becoming a Class S Supreme Overlord, unlocking his fullest potential and reaching new heights of power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, Osborne was ruining everything.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was humiliating Cuthbert in the arena, shattering any chance of building that invincible spirit.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead of ascending to new levels, Cuthbert would be lucky to escape this ordeal without deep psychological scars.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His progress towards Class S would be hindered, perhaps even permanently stalled at Class AAA by the demons of his own mind.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson family's anger was understandable, their desire to storm the arena and kill Osborne almost palpable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop!" A commanding voice rang out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Cuthbert's father, Marvin, rising to his full height. His aura as a Class S Supreme Overlord pulsed, sending shivers of fear through the assembled crowd.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin fixed Osborne with a cold stare. "The Honor Quest Ceremony is not yet over. Cuthbert has not conceded. Whatever his opponent does to him is within the rules."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We, the Williamson family, abide by the rules we set."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's words were calm, but his eyes betrayed his fury.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin looked at Osborne as if he were already a dead man.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne tensed, feeling the weight of Marvin's gaze.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had anticipated this reaction when he decided to humiliate Cuthbert. Here, in the heart of the Williamson family's domain, such an act would not be tolerated.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne could have stopped, could have walked away with his victory.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he chose not to.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert had humiliated Rhett, the Williamson family had insulted the Lambert family, and Cuthbert had harmed Emma.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For Osborne, backing down now would be an unforgivable betrayal of his own principles.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, he stood his ground, foot still pressed firmly on Cuthbert's head, ignoring the Class S Supreme Overlord's threatening stare.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ahh!!!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's cries continued, hoarse and filled with agony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was barely able to utter the word "concede."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's expression hardened further, and the anger of the Williamson family grew, a palpable sense of menace filling the air above their estate. Dark clouds gathered, mirroring the storm brewing below.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Marvin spoke again, "Cuthbert, concede.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For over two hundred years, only three have completed the Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The rest, they all fall. It's only a matter of when, not if.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Remember this lesson, and earn back your pride through your own strength."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Marvin finished speaking, Osborne felt a strange force surge into Cuthbert's body.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was too fast, too unexpected for him to react or intervene.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The subtle force flowed into Cuthbert's body, and he seemed to regain some strength.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I lost!" Cuthbert rasped out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned, realizing that the obscure power had actually been triggered by Marvin. Marvin's intention was to restore Cuthbert's strength just enough for him to concede so that Osborne could no longer humiliate him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, Marvin had achieved his goal.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Cuthbert's surrender, his Honor Quest Ceremony came to an end, and Osborne could no longer degrade him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression remained stern, but he finally lifted his foot off Cuthbert.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert gasped for breath, his chest heaving violently. It took him a long moment before he could slowly rise to his feet. His eyes, bloodshot and wild, locked onto Osborne with the ferocity of a cornered beast.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfazed, Osborne held his ground, meeting Cuthbert's glare head-on.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cuthbert! Remember the disgrace you endured today!" Marvin's voice cut through the tension coldly. "If you want to break through to Class S and become a Supreme Overlord, you'll need to claw your way back up on your own. Use the humiliation you suffered today as fuel!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Marvin spun on his heel and strode away swiftly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Honor Quest Ceremony had come to an unexpected and humiliating end for Cuthbert.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one anticipated that he would be defeated by a Class AA and subjected to such public ridicule.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert had boasted about achieving a streak of a hundred victories, yet he hadn't even managed fifty.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a bitter blow to his pride.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shaking with rage, Cuthbert glared at Osborne, his face contorted with fury. "Just wait! I'll make you pay for this. I'll bathe in your blood and cleanse the disgrace you've heaped upon me!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mark my words, you'll pay!"</p></div>
