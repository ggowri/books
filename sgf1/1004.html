        <h1>Chapter 1004 Counterattack</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson was a whirlwind of fury, unleashing her rage and bloodlust with each strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her divine artifact dagger sliced through Osborne's defenses over and over, leaving a painful array of wounds across his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It filled her with twisted delight; each cut felt like retribution for her daughter's death, each thrust of the blade granting her a small taste of the vengeance she craved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she found herself marveling at Osborne's resilient defenses&mdash;defenses that felt out of place for a mere Class AAA, even rivaling many Class S warriors&mdash;Crimson felt no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the contrary, the very act of slowly inflicting wounds upon him brought her a twisted satisfaction. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each cut and gash, she felt her pleasure deepen, her mind swimming in visions of stripping Osborne's flesh away, layer by layer, until he was a withered skeleton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t mount a solid defense. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His injured left leg hindered his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Crimson, she thought everything was in her control and Osborne was nothing more than a toy for her to ravage at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's hand shot out, seizing her arm with an unexpected burst of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grip was strong enough to prevent her from pulling away, but Crimson remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said with a sardonic smile, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at you, hanging in there. You really think grabbing my arm changes anything? Even if you hold on for dear life, I can still carve you up, piece by piece!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, she produced yet another divine artifact dagger, plunging it viciously toward Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade met its mark, embedding deeply and providing multiple fresh gashes that oozed blood, painting Osborne red as if he were nothing more than a canvas for her rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he seemed unfazed, almost indifferent as if the daggers didn't even pierce his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vampire Transformation! Breath of Celestial!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tightened his grip on Crimson's arm, summoning the full force of his power as he channeled the strength from his right leg's Divine Bone. With a determined kick, he struck her hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson's arm was seized by Osborne, leaving her with no escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne struck her with a kick. This time, she was ready, bracing herself in anticipation. Still, the force sent her reeling, a spray of blood erupting from her mouth, though the wound was relatively minor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But twice now, Osborne had drawn her blood&mdash;a provocation that ignited a fierce rage within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill you for that!" Crimson screamed. Her voice was laced with madness as she lashed out with renewed vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her strikes grew even stronger, slicing into Osborne's flesh, leaving gaping wounds that exposed bone beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't flinch; he kept retaliating, his kicks finding their mark against her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time ticked away, the Divine Bone energy drained, but Osborne wasn't finished. He unleashed Explosive Force time and time again, trying to give Crimson's internal injuries. They finally made </span><span>Crimson</span><span> bleed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pain was stacking up, but compared to Osborne, who now resembled a ragged cloth saturated in blood, it was merely a scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His vision blurred, consciousness teetering on the edge of darkness as he felt his mind slipping away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson noticed his deteriorating state, a triumphant smirk dancing on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can trade blows with me? How cute! I'm just going to get a bruise while you are on a fast track to the grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly a flicker of a smile broke through his pain, a cold smile that held an edge of defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Light of Redemption!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed the power of Light of Redemption upon himself when he realized that he was about to faint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A radiant light descended from the sky, enveloping Osborne in its embrace. In an instant, every wound, every ounce of energy he had expended, began to heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a heartbeat ago, Osborne had been teetering on the brink of unconsciousness, but now, he surged back to his peak, revitalized and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Martial art aura erupted from him once again. With no trace of his previous injuries, he locked eyes with Crimson, his cold gaze brimming with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think it's going to be you who ends up dead!" Osborne declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Crimson could even process the shift in the battle, Osborne launched himself forward, and the divine power in his right leg surged back to life. He unleashed a devastating kick aimed directly at her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Crimson gasped, her face draining of color as she saw his recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to draw back, but Osborne's grip on her arm was stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's right foot struck her chest like a hammer hitting an anvil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was catastrophic; the wounded Crimson had no chance of withstanding it. Her body folded inward as the sound of cracking bones filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't done. He knew that Crimson was a top-tier Class S warrior notorious for her tenacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that understanding fueling him, he unleashed a torrent of speed and brutality unmatched in previous exchanges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each strike was merciless, Osborne pouring all his strength into every blow as he hammered down on Crimson. Blood and flesh splattered because of the blows.</span></p></div>
