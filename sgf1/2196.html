        <h1>Chapter 2182 Furious Atticus-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white tiger let out a thunderous roar that seemed to tear through the air and shake the very ground beneath their feet. Its overwhelming aura was so intense that an ordinary person would have been seized by panic, their legs quivering uncontrollably and their faces drained of all color.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne simply flashed a confident smile and nonchalantly waved at the colossal creature.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey there, little tiger! I just knew you'd swing by again!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little tiger?!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white tiger came to an abrupt halt, its eyes ablaze with a deadly combination of rage and bloodlust.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You audacious human anomaly! You're practically begging for death! I am Prince Atticus Connery of the White Tiger Tribe within the Sacred Tiger Clan! How dare you address me as a 'little tiger'? Originally, I planned to end you swiftly. But now, I'm going to savor the pleasure of shattering every bone in your body, pulverizing your flesh into fine dust, and making you endure the most excruciating agony imaginable before you finally breathe your last!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having uttered those menacing words, Atticus took a menacing step forward, his every movement exuding a palpable and chilling killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, wore a broad smile, seemingly unfazed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, he was cautious, having activated Satan's Eye to scrutinize Atticus closely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he let out a quiet sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phew! This guy is just a projection! His power level is still at Supernal Deity King, and he lacks any Sacred Power. Nothing to fear, then.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm demeanor, he replied, "So, you're named Atticus? You think you can crush my bones? I doubt you have it in you! Last time, you wanted to kill me, but you ended up running away with your tail between your legs. This time... I suspect it'll end the same way."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atticus' anger flared even more at Osborne's words. "You're too arrogant for your own good! The only reason I didn't kill you last time was that I underestimated your strength and wasn't prepared. But this time, I've come fully equipped to end you!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't belong in this world! In just a few months, you've jumped from Ascension One to Ascension Four. The Order of the Celestial Way won't allow you to continue rising! So prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, Atticus lunged, his massive claws slashing toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrifying claw marks came crashing down on Osborne like a hailstorm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer brute force behind the attack was so intense that it felt even more powerful than what an ordinary Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King could muster.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atticus' power is at least on par with an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King. Heck, it might even be on the level of an Ascension Nine one!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grim.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't merged with the fragment of the World Tree, he'd be in a real bind. He'd have no choice but to rely on an absolute forbidden zone to bring Atticus' cultivation level down a notch. Then, Osborne'd have to go all-out just in the hopes of getting the upper hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thanks to the World Tree fragment, things were a whole lot simpler now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No need for all those convoluted tactics!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled and raised his hand, casually saying, "Little tiger, what are you trying to do here? Want to give me a high-five?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How polite of you! Come on, let's do this!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a massive palm print surged forth, meeting Atticus' claws head-on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their attacks collided, it sounded like a thunderclap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atticus' claws shattered instantly, and Osborne's palm print, undiminished in power, continued its relentless advance toward Atticus.</span></p></div>
