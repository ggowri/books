        <h1>Chapter 2204 Capture Them All-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's eyes bulged in shock. "What are you talking about? I don't get it! I've already given you my promise. I swear, if you let me go, I won't come after you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's contempt was thick in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still acting dumb? Once you're back at the Mystic Sirius Sect, you won't even have to lift a finger against me! All you need to do is mention my Sacred Artifact palace to the big-wigs, and they'll come storming onto Celestara Planet, eager to take me out and snatch my palace away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To safeguard the secret of the Sacred Artifact Palace, how could I set you free?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's cut the small talk, shall we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's face drained of color in terror, and then quickly contorted into a snarl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that pleading was a waste of breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had made his stance crystal clear&mdash;unless he was utterly clueless about the value of the Sacred Artifact palace, there was no chance he'd let him go scot-free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, if you're going to kill me, I'll put up a fight!" Maddox bellowed, deciding to face him head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly for him, even as an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King, he was no match for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick, fluid movement, Osborne whipped out the Bloodwrought Bow and casually loosed two arrows. The arrows struck Maddox hard, leaving him severely injured and completely helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of finishing him off, Osborne decided to take Maddox back to the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, directing it towards Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation etched on his face, Maddox pleaded, "Osborne, I'm willing to serve you! I'll be your loyal servant, doing whatever you need, as long as you spare my life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can control me however you want, and I promise I won't betray you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, his eyes glinting with amusement. "Well, well! You've come to your senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's exactly what I was hoping for when I chose not to kill you. Your willingness to cooperate saves me a lot of hassle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll make sure you're under my control, so there's no chance of betrayal. You'd better not resist, though; my patience is limited!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's hope dwindled as despair took its place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But compared to death, he preferred being under Osborne's control and reluctantly nodded. "I promise I won't resist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting more time, Osborne summoned a blood-red root from his body, plunging it deep into Maddox. Since Maddox didn't resist, the root quickly took hold within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Maddox was fully under Osborne's control, transformed into his Blood Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My lord!" he said, bowing with newfound respect, his demeanor completely altered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Ascension Nine Blood Golem was incredibly valuable to him, particularly given that the cultivation levels of his Blood Demon members had dropped considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ordered, "Just hold your horses for a bit. I've got to subdue the others and turn them into my Blood Golems as well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox, being an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King, was a tough nut to crack for Osborne. If he put up a fight, it would be no easy feat to transform him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the remaining six were merely at the Ascension Seven level, far weaker than Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't even waste time asking for their permission. He just drove the roots into their bodies, setting the transformation process in motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took a while, but in the end, all six of them were successfully transformed into Blood Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the seven of them stood dutifully behind Osborne, ready to make their way back to Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the journey back, Osborne realized that during their hasty chase, he had used up a large number of Sacred Crystals to boost the speed of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. Since there was no longer any need to rush, he significantly reduced the speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of curiosity, he turned to Maddox and asked, "I'm truly intrigued. Why were you all trying to flee deeper into the cosmos? Were you planning to traverse the entire cosmos to get back to Racial Convergence Planet? That place is quite a distance from Celestara Planet, isn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not take the deep-space route? It seems like it would be a shorter way to reach Elf City and then continue on to Racial Convergence Planet, doesn't it?"</span></p></div>
