        <h1>Chapter 1399 Trouble</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Harry and Amelia were about to enter the stone hut, a sharp voice cut through the air. "Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick strode forward, flanked by a large group of followers. Beside him was a striking woman, her face set in a fierce expression as she approached with purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Harry and Amelia spotted them, their faces paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged a quick glance, anxiety creeping into their expressions as they struggled to maintain their composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Mr. Swift," they said in unison, bowing slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry feigned calmness, though his voice trembled slightly. "There are still two days left until the Essence Crystal submission date. What brings you here to see us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick let out a cold laugh. "Harry, spare me the act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know I'm not here for your Essence Crystals. I have something far more pressing to discuss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's anxiety deepened, but he forced himself to remain steady. "What other matter could you possibly need? We've been busy digging for Essence Crystals and haven't kept up with outside events. Please, enlighten us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sneer, Patrick replied, "Still playing dumb, huh? I'm here about Vance! Tell me, where is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's face drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice quivered as he stammered, "Mr... Mr. Swift, I... I don't know what you're talking about. Vance? How would I know where he is? I barely knew him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp command from Patrick made Harry jump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! You think you can fool me? If I didn't have solid evidence, would I come looking for you? You're digging your own grave, Harry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vance has been missing for four days, and the last place he was seen was looking for you two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now tell me, did you kill him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's gaze was icy, his intent to kill palpable as he fixed his eyes on Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The siblings were instantly gripped by fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were not good at hiding their emotions, and Patrick's intimidation made them look ghostly pale, panic etched across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a fool could see they were hiding something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beautiful woman beside Patrick spoke up, her voice laced with fury and venom, "Just as I thought! You two killed my brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at the siblings, her eyes blazing with rage. "You two scoundrels! How could you kill my brother? He was so kind! I'll make you pay for this! You'll pay for what you did to him! Honey, you have to avenge him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she clung to Patrick's arm, tears streaming down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick smirked, his expression hardening. "Don't worry, my dear. Vance was your brother, which makes him my brother too. Whoever is responsible for his death will face the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his cold gaze back to Harry and Amelia. "Are you two still going to deny it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me how you killed Vance! Why did you do it? If you come clean now, I might just make it quick for you. Otherwise, you'll wish you were never born!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying aura erupted from Patrick, enveloping Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Superior Deity, Patrick was far stronger than either of them, and with his band of followers behind him, the weight of his presence was suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia's faces turned even paler, their panic escalating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"N... no, we didn't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't say that! We... we..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their words tumbled out in a jumbled mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Patrick was convinced of their guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a chilling laugh. "Still trying to squirm out of this, huh? It's clear you've got something to hide! Vance must have discovered your secret, and that's why he ended up dead, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Search the place!" Patrick commanded, and his crew rushed into the stone hut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia's anxiety skyrocketed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You can't just barge into our home like this! On what grounds are you searching our place..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their protests were cut short as Patrick blocked their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make one move, and I'll kill you both!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia froze, their eyes filling with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, someone burst out, ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Found them! We've got a haul of over 10 thousand Essence Crystals in their room&mdash;including over a hundred mid-grade ones!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over 10 thousand Essence Crystals? And over a hundred mid-grade ones?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick glared at Harry and Amelia, his greed flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused to himself, "So, the siblings really do have a secret! They've got over a hundred mid-grade Essence Crystals&mdash;they must have tapped into a high-grade vein!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to get them locked up and force them to spill the beans on that vein's location!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Patrick bellowed, "You two are in deep trouble! All of this belongs to Vance. You killed him and stole his Essence Crystals. The evidence is undeniable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take them into custody and throw them in the dungeon. I'll interrogate them personally!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His henchmen pounced on Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The siblings' despair deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These men were all Intermediate Deities&mdash;a whopping dozen of them!</span></p></div>
