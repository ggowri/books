        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I'm itching to know what it is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela gave him an eye-roll. "As long as you're okay! As for that surprise, just be patient&mdash;you'll find out soon enough! But for now, congrats on your win! You've made me beam with pride, and you've put the Mystic Sirius Sect back in the spotlight! You're now the mightiest one below the Empyrean Sacredness in Tempest Fortress City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a brilliant smile lit up Angela's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would've ever guessed that Osborne would manage to take down all his tough competitors in the city duel of Tempest Fortress City and claim the championship in such a jaw-dropping way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was truly a classic underdog tale!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela couldn't help but swell with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd put her trust in Osborne and wagered ten thousand Sacred Crystals on his victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, she figured that money was as good as gone, like throwing it into the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But look at him now&mdash;he'd pulled it off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she placed her bet, the odds of Osborne winning were a mind-boggling 130 to 1.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant her initial stake had ballooned to a staggering 1.3 million Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a small fortune&mdash;enough to keep her set for training resources for years to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, her excitement practically oozing out, "Nice work!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the city duel </span><span>ain't</span><span> over yet. You should take a breather down there for now! There's still the awards ceremony and the expedition ceremony coming up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and give me your betting slip! I'll go and collect your winnings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Azure Haven Academy even thinks about stiffing you, I'll have a chat with Ms. Alba, and they'll be kicking themselves for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela said this loud and clear for everyone to hear. Nearby, the bigwigs from Azure Haven Academy couldn't help but scowl, their faces turning sour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when they remembered Angela's real identity and just how powerful Adriana was, they felt a sense of powerlessness wash over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no other option but to fork over the money. Trying any funny business would be a waste of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sinking feeling, they carried the unconscious Leroy away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, the city duel went on, but nobody was bothered about the remaining matches. All eyes were fixed on Osborne, with looks of a mixture of awe and disbelief on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The underdog had really made his name!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the duel kicked off, almost everyone had taken it for granted that Leroy would snatch the championship, considering her overwhelming might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then came Osborne, who defeated Leroy, Marreese, Tyson, Pero, and even Clara, and finally clinched the title of the city </span><span>duel</span><span> champion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne had gotten the better of Clara earlier, some had murmured that he must have bribed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, no one entertained such ideas anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had soundly trounced Leroy, who was armed with a Sacred Artifact, leaving no room for doubt about his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the champion, hands down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the city duel wrapped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a look at the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The champion was Osborne from the Mystic Sirius Sect, who had an undefeated record of 15 wins and 0 losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The runner-up was Clara from Fantasia Isle, with 14 wins and 1 loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking third place was Leroy from Azure Haven Academy, </span><span>with</span><span> </span><span>13 wins and 2 losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese from Azure Haven Academy finished in fourth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson from Fantasia Isle landed in fifth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan from the Mystic Sirius Sect claimed seventh place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar from the Mystic Sirius Sect secured the ninth spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Leroy had been knocked out by Osborne, she was unable to participate in the subsequent battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Clara won by default, which enabled her to overtake Leroy at the last moment and secure the runner-up position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the entire city duel, Clara had only been defeated by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Leroy, who had been the top favorite to win the championship, she ended up in third place after losing to both Osborne and Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous champion, Marreese, had a disappointing performance and finished in fourth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Bethan and Jamar from the Mystic Sirius Sect also managed to make it into the top ten. This achievement not only earned them spots in the state duel that was going to take place a month later but also at least 1000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Osborne, he had amassed an astonishing ten thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!</span><span> </span></p></div>
