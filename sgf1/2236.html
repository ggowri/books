        <h1>Chapter 2211 Retreat-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne entered the Hope Haven, ready to begin his seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation level stood at Ascension Four Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had achieved mid-Level Ten in his primary elemental essences&mdash;space, dark, and lightning&mdash;and was on the verge of reaching the pinnacle of Level Ten, the limit beneath Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, Osborne had successfully fused his dark and space elemental essences ahead of schedule, granting him Sacred Power. This newfound power was the key to his ability to challenge and ultimately defeat Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye was the foundation of Osborne's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now at Sacredness Level, its incredible vision and X-ray vision continued to be invaluable assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Satan's Eye bestowed upon him the time power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's time manipulation abilities had surpassed even Ophelia's, although he rarely utilized them to their full extent. Most of the time, he simply accelerated time to give himself more opportunities to train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he had set the time around him to a hundred times faster than normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could have cranked up the time acceleration even more, but he had learned the hard way in his past life that going too fast could backfire spectacularly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing the limits beyond a hundredfold would mess with the fundamental laws of the universe, turning cultivation into a frustrating exercise in futility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred times the speed was just right&mdash;a sweet spot that balanced efficiency and safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, that was more than sufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye was another game-changer in his cultivation journey. It continuously absorbed and broke down the energy from Sacred Crystals, providing a steady stream of support as Osborne worked to level up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Satan's Eye was absolutely essential for Osborne's advancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there were the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and the Orb of Reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were Sacred Artifacts, but one was in pretty rough shape, which limited its effectiveness, while the other didn't offer any offensive or defensive capabilities, making it less than helpful for Osborne's cultivation level advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the flip side, the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, although just a quasi-Sacred Artifact, had massive potential. With a stash of a thousand Azure Ores at his disposal, Osborne was convinced that integrating them into the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow could elevate it to a true Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could pull that off, even the most basic Sacred Artifact would give a serious boost to his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, the wisdom he had gained from his previous life as a dedicated cultivator&mdash;someone who had devoted himself entirely to training&mdash;had armed him with valuable insights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it didn't directly increase his strength, it certainly filled in the blanks in his understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a solid grasp of his current abilities, Osborne set about outlining his next objectives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first order of business is to break through to the next cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Four is just too weak! It might fly on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet, but on Racial Convergence Planet, I'd be a laughingstock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up, I need to integrate more power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The potency of my Sacred Power relies on how many different energies I can blend together. I'm bound to run into Empyrean Sacredness warriors over there&mdash;potential foes I can't afford to underestimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I go up against Empyrean Sacredness, most of my tricks won't stand a chance! I've got to </span><span>amp</span><span> up my Sacred Power if I want to hold my own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alright then, it's time to get serious and dive into my training!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that newfound resolve, Osborne fully committed to his seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he shut himself away, he collected the majority of the Element Gold Crystals </span><span>and Sacred Crystals he had snagged from the Dark Earth Continent. Handing them over to Isa and the others, he made sure they were distributed wisely to help boost their own strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was worth mentioning that Osborne had already resurrected the members of both the Blood Demon and the Hudson family, and a portion of the Element Gold Crystals and Sacred Crystals he had collected belonged to them as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had also restored the freedom of the Blood Demon members, meaning they were no longer his Blood Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only seven remained under his command&mdash;Maddox and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time flowed swiftly by, aided by the power of Satan's Eye and the hundredfold acceleration, Osborne's cultivation level began to rise rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was advancing through Ascension Five and continuing on to Ascension Six.</span></p></div>
