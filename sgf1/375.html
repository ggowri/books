        <h1>Chapter 375 Kill Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Running away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was having a great time fighting when he suddenly saw Brad fleeing rapidly into the distance. He sneered coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's blood-red hair suddenly grew crazily, stretching out for hundreds of yards in the blink of an eye, covering the sky above the sea like countless whips. In an instant, it reached Brad's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was terrified at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The martial art aura around him burst out wildly, trying to shake off the blood-red hair, but it was useless. The hair wrapped tightly around him, binding his body. His martial art aura began to crumble as if its power was being absorbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad finally felt real fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's blood-red hair was too bizarre. Even his martial art aura couldn't stop it and was instead quickly drained of its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, even Osborne was a bit surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since transforming into a Vampire, the most bizarre thing about him was his hair, which could grow rapidly at his will. No enemy ever escaped once entangled by his blood-red hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the hair pierced into the body, it could suppress one's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was a metahuman or a martial artist, they would be subdued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the blood-red hair showed a new ability. It could absorb the power of the martial art aura. Brad's martial art aura, which even Osborne found troublesome, was like an impenetrable shell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Osborne's overwhelming pressure on Brad, he had been using all his strength and still couldn't completely shatter Brad's martial art aura, only gradually breaking through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the eerie blood-red hair took just a few seconds to completely devour Brad's martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Martial art aura was the condensed power of a Class A martial master, formed from their energy and blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After martial art aura was absorbed, Brad's energy and blood were instantly drained. He went from looking like a middle-aged man to an old man in a flash, with his face wrinkled like a dried prune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with fear and quickly became cloudy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad felt his strength disappearing and his energy withering. He cried out in agony, but even his voice became hoarse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He completely gave up struggling, having no strength left to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood-red hair absorbed all his power and energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body eventually shriveled up like a dry twig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation scared not only Brad but even Osborne himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne felt Brad's energy flowing through his blood-red hair, surging into his body without lingering, and instead, all of it surged into the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a vague sense that the Blood Cross had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like something terrifying was awakening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Osborne frown, but he quickly dismissed the thought. The Blood Cross had fully merged with his body, and its power was now his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross had absorbed Brad's energy, making it stronger, which also meant that Osborne had become stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had known the blood-red hair was this powerful, I wouldn't have fought so hard. But, if I hadn't injured Brad and worn down his strength, maybe the blood-red hair wouldn't have been able to devour his martial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood-red hair might be my secret weapon against Class A martial masters in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having thought this, Osborne retracted the blood-red hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to look in another direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lauren was fleeing in panic, filled with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept glancing back and had seen Osborne use the eerie blood-red hair to drain Brad dry, which had frightened her out of her wits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dared not stop, hoping Osborne wouldn't notice her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, her prayers went unanswered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fixed his gaze on the fleeing Lauren and sneered, waving his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a dimensional rift appeared in front of Lauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Focused solely on escaping, Lauren didn't notice the rift until it was too late. Then, she crashed into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Lauren's body shattered like a piece of broken glass, splitting into two halves. Her face still bore an expression of terror, but she could no longer speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the most outstanding young members of the Paltrow family, she had no chance to resist and died at sea, her body falling into the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it was Yohan's turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thrown into the sea by Lauren, he finally woke up due to the inability to breathe. When he opened his eyes, he saw Lauren being sliced in half by the dimensional rift, and terror filled his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, another dimensional rift appeared, and his body was also split in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood stained the sea red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing all this, Osborne finally breathed a sigh of relief and looked at Isaac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was standing with his mouth open, his face full of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had actually done it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had killed a Class A martial master, and it seemed so effortless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was about to say something when he suddenly became horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone is coming."</span></p></div>
