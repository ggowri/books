        <h1>Chapter 2289 Tough-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of assessment was exclusive to Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the official assessment of Zephyr State, Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson were all one-man armies. It meant they stood a good chance of making it into the top ten even without forming teams or getting any assistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, among them, only Agatha was a sure-shot for a top-ten spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even mused that she could take the championship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she needed was a stroke of luck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that brief assessment, everyone could sense Agatha's might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when they actually laid eyes on her, the crowd soon realized that what really stole the show wasn't her strength, but her looks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Agatha made her entrance, almost every guy in the place was left gobsmacked, captivated by her breathtaking beauty and alluring curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the ladies couldn't tear their eyes away from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just drop-dead gorgeous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there were a few who remained unmoved by Agatha's beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Horace, for example.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant he saw Agatha, a fierce fighting spirit blazed in Horace's eyes. The power swirling around him went haywire, surging towards Agatha like a wild tempest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holy smokes! He actually threw down the gauntlet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one saw Horace's attack coming in this place. By the time folks snapped out of their shock, Horace's power was already bearing down on Agatha like a freight train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic swept across everyone's faces like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Agatha was as cool as a cucumber. She just gave a nonchalant wave of her hand, and poof! Horace's power vanished into thin air, like it had never even existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace's eyes widened in shock, his face set in a grimace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick, Benson, and the rest also looked like they'd just swallowed a lemon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Agatha spoke up, her voice as smooth as honey, "Horace, if you're itching for a fight, hold your horses till the state duel officially kicks off. We can find a nice spot and go toe-to-toe! Right now, the duel's not even started. No need to be so trigger-happy, or you might end up dragging innocent bystanders into the mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace let out a scoff, his fighting spirit still burning bright. "Agatha, you better believe I will! When the state duel rolls around, we'll settle this once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing!" Agatha replied, sounding as blas&eacute; as can be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a quick look around the area before pulling her gaze back in, her face as expressionless as a stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like she didn't even consider anyone there a real worthy opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no hint of contempt or disdain on her face, but everyone could feel her cold indifference, and it rubbed them the wrong way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what could they say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha was a force to be reckoned with. Even though Horace's earlier attack wasn't a full-power attack, it still sent shivers down their spines. If it were them on the receiving end, they probably wouldn't stand a chance, even if they went all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Agatha had just flicked her hand, and Horace's power was history. It was like she was swatting away a pesky fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others? They couldn't even come close to her level of cool-headedness and raw power. It was like trying to catch lightning in a bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne's face was as serious as a heart attack at that moment. He could feel the heat from Agatha, and it was making his palms sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's a real oddball!" Osborne muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether he could take her down or not was anyone's guess until they stepped into the ring at the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson, Broderick, Horace, and Agatha were all holding their cards close to their chests. None of them had shown off their Sacred Artifacts yet, and those things were like wild cards in a high-stakes poker game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha's Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Horace's Frost-invoking Canvas were no joke. They were well-known for giving even the big-wigs in the Empyrean Sacredness level a run for their money. Osborne wasn't sure if he could stand up to their might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One thing was for sure, the state duel was going to be a real barn-burner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Making it into the top ten wasn't going to be a walk in the park. He'd have to fight like a cornered animal, tooth and nail.</span></p></div>
