        <h1>Chapter 2162 Hope of Resurrection</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne materialized from the depths of Umbra Earth, taking a moment to catch his breath as he surveyed his unfamiliar surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally made it out!" he exclaimed, relief washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of teleporting directly to Elf City with the Spatial Translocator, he had chosen a random spot, now finding himself floating in the vastness of deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where am I? It feels like I'm quite a distance from the Eighth World Tree offshoot's lair..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, realizing just how far he really was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a familiar voice resonated in his mind. "Far? You have no idea just how far you've traveled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial! You're awake!" Osborne's heart leaped with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After entering Umbra Earth, he had discovered that Primordial, who resided within the Soul Current Ocean, had inexplicably fallen into a deep slumber, rendering communication impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, just as he escaped Umbra Earth, Primordial had stirred. With the memories of the Eighth World Tree offshoot, Primordial's understanding of deep space far surpassed Osborne's. With Primordial's guidance, he felt confident he could quickly find his way back to Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Awake? I've always been awake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was that overwhelming force in Umbra Earth that kept me from reaching out to you. Only now, having left that place, can I finally speak," Primordial explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? I see!" Osborne was taken aback but didn't dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strangeness of Umbra Earth was well-known, and it made sense that such a powerful force could suppress Primordial's communication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you gain while you were above Umbra Earth? Wait&mdash;your cultivation level is already at Ascension Six? That's impossible! How could you jump from Ascension One to Ascension Six in less than a month?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's astonishment was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, revealing the Sublime Concealment Orb that had masked his true cultivation level. "It's actually Ascension Three. I used the Sublime Concealment Orb to disguise my level. Even you didn't catch on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Three? Ah, the Sublime Concealment Orb! No wonder I couldn't see through your ruse! That's a treasure beyond measure! But still, to jump from Ascension One to Ascension Three in under a month is incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must have gained a lot in Umbra Earth! Tell me everything&mdash;what happened? What treasures did you find?" Primordial's curiosity was insatiable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hold back. He quickly recounted his experiences, including the 50 thousand Sacred Crystals and the Ascending Sacred Sanctum he had acquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that with Primordial now intertwined with his Soul Current Ocean, there was no point in hiding anything. Even if Primordial learned his secrets, betrayal was out of the question; if Osborne fell, so would Primordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne couldn't be bothered to keep it under wraps. Since Primordial dwelling in his Soul Current Ocean would unearth his secrets sooner or later anyway, why waste energy on hiding?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when he reached the part about Alfreda's death at the hands of Isidore and his inability to resurrect her with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, Osborne's mood darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the thought of Alfreda twisted his heart, causing a deep, aching pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial, on the other hand, was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three thousand Element Gold Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over two thousand Azure Ores?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four thousand Radiant Golden Ores?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Sublime Concealment Orb?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ascending Sacred Sanctum?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The remains of an Empyrean Sacredness creature?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you really acquire all this in Umbra Earth? Are you some kind of illegitimate child of that place? Why on earth do all the good things seem to fall into your lap? I doubt the combined haul of everyone else even comes close to what you've got!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's astonishment was beyond measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of the treasures Osborne had acquired was a prize worth fighting for, coveted by any Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, having come out of Umbra Earth with a whole trove of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no wonder Primordial felt a mix of envy and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, couldn't find joy in his bounty. If given the choice, he would trade every single treasure to bring Alfreda back to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of using the Ascending Sacred Sanctum as a bargaining chip to resurrect her filled him with a deep yearning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? You've got all these treasures, and yet you're still down in the dumps? Is it because of Princess Alfreda's death?" Primordial inquired, sensing Osborne's somber mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, a storm of rage and hatred flickering in his eyes. "Isidore! That head of the Ethereal Elven Temple won't get away with this. One day, I'll storm that temple and take him down. I'll avenge Alfreda!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial beamed at his words. "Now that's the spirit! You're still just an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, vowing to take down an Empyrean Sacredness warrior? I have to say, that's quite bold of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But revenge is a long game. No matter how talented you are, you know it would take an Empyrean Sacredness warrior's strength to take one down! No stories I've heard speak of a Supernal Deity King managing to defeat an Empyrean Sacredness warrior; even geniuses from the Sacred Dragon Clan struggle to defeat them at Supernal Deity King level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne agreed, fully aware of the vast gap between his strength and Isidore's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also knew that if Isidore were here in person, Isidore could snuff Osborne out with just a flick of his finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was undeterred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had faith in himself; he would become an Empyrean Sacredness warrior one day&mdash;he would avenge Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the thought of her brought back memories that made his fists clench in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne loathed himself for his lack of strength. He hated that he hadn't been able to protect Alfreda and that there was nothing he could do to bring her back to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, you don't need to be so down about it," Primordial spoke up, sensing Osborne's turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I not? My friend was killed, and I couldn't save her!" Osborne shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! That's not quite what I mean... Princess Alfreda might not be entirely gone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait. What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne practically jolted at Primordial's words, his entire being snapping to attention as he watched Primordial, a small tree-like spirit, floating delicately like a newborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial, what are you saying? You mean Alfreda can be revived?" Osborne's voice trembled slightly, filled with overwhelming excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial smiled gently, "Exactly! Princess Alfreda can be revived! Remember how you used the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to replicate her life essence? As long as her life essence exists, there's still a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily dumbfounded, processing the revelation. "But I've tried countless times! I couldn't bring her back using the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial explained quickly, "That's because you weren't strong enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda was killed by an Empyrean Sacredness warrior, whose power level is far above yours. In your current state, you simply can't harness the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to revive her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But once you strengthen your own power&mdash;becoming an Empyrean Sacredness warrior yourself&mdash;or even just reaching Ascension Eight, Nine, or Ten as a Supernal Deity King, then combined with the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, you might just be able to bring Princess Alfreda back to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of elation washed over Osborne at this revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clutched Primordial tightly, his voice trembling with excitement. "You mean it? Just by getting stronger, I can revive Alfreda?"</span></p></div>
