        <h1>Chapter 1885 Escape</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My son Kurt isn't poisoned at all! His Soul Current Ocean is just in chaos from the shock!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's fury surged, and his icy gaze locked onto Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You damn fool! You dare to deceive me? I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he summoned a deadly ice blade that hovered ominously above Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying ice blade descended in an instant. But Osborne was ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed a powerful punch upward while simultaneously dodging to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fist collided with the ice blade, but it shattered upon impact, failing to create even a dent. The force of the blow exploded, sending shards flying as the ice blade continued its descent. Despite his evasive maneuver, Osborne couldn't completely escape its wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade grazed his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's divine power defense crumbled like paper, torn apart by the icy onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, a brilliant light erupted around him just in time to deflect the ice blade's deadly strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the glow shattered completely, Osborne managed to evade the worst of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That light came from the Ultimate Luminous Armor&mdash;a piece that originally belonged to Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After capturing Kurt, Osborne had stripped the armor off him and donned it himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, its protective power finally came into play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Trevor was far too powerful. Even with the Ultimate Luminous Armor, Osborne couldn't withstand the full force of Trevor's attack. The armor's defenses were ultimately ripped apart, leaving a deep gash on Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ice blade crashed down, and within the Universe-Sealing Formation, it felt as if the world had come to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic erupted as everyone scrambled to escape, desperate to avoid being caught in Osborne's mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor was taken aback that his strike hadn't finished Osborne off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly regained his composure, a cold smirk spreading across his face. "You managed to dodge my attack&mdash;impressive! You truly live up to the name 'Theodore'! But make no mistake; you're still going to die today! In my Universe-Sealing Formation, there's no escape for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a massive ice blade materialized above Osborne once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened as he felt the chilling breath of death creeping closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, instead of panic, a cold smile crept onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a deafening roar and violent tremors ripped through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Universe-Sealing Formation's blood-red barrier shook uncontrollably, as if it were under assault. With a resounding pop, it shattered completely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The abruptness of this change caught everyone off-guard&mdash;even Trevor hadn't anticipated that the Universe-Sealing Formation would break apart so suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face paled as he turned to look outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, in the distance, stood thousands of figures, each a peak Deity King&mdash;all had come together to smash through Trevor's formation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the charge was none other than Zachary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the barrier crumbled, Zachary released a breath of relief. He shot a subtle glance at Osborne, communicating a silent message, before quickly shifting his gaze away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, wasn't about to let an opportunity slip by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant the Universe-Sealing Formation broke, he summoned his spatial power and activated interdimensional travel, vanishing in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fearsome ice blade that had marked his position finally descended, crashing into empty air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was already long gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's fury ignited, his cold gaze fixed on Zachary and his companions. "Zachary! Are you looking for death? How dare you breach my Universe-Sealing Formation and let that bastard Theodore slip away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's murderous intent enveloped Zachary like a shroud, but Zachary stood undeterred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of Trevor's terrifying aura, he and the thousand individuals beside him surged with a formidable energy that pushed back against Trevor's fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every one of them was a peak Deity King, and the combined might of so many was enough to make even a Supernal Deity King like Trevor reconsider his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary retorted, unfazed, "I'd say you're the one looking for trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trevor, you actually dared to trap Alicia and Nadia inside the Universe-Sealing Formation? What's your plan? To kill them or plunge the Hudson family into all-out war?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for 'Theodore'? "Who's this 'Theodore'? I have no idea! I broke your Universe-Sealing Formation just to save my sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Zachary waved toward Alicia and Nadia. "Alicia! Nadia! Are you okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did that bastard hurt you? If he did, we're going to settle this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does he really think the Hudson family is a pushover?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's fierce demeanor made it clear he was ready to clash with Trevor at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor seethed with anger, but he had no retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's excuse stood strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had torn through the Universe-Sealing Formation to rescue Alicia and Nadia, and the escape of "Theodore" had been purely incidental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Trevor felt his rage boil over.</span></p></div>
