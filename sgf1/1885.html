        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor said coldly, his voice cutting through the tension in the air, "I can tell you why I know your true self is nearby. But let me make myself clear, if you don't give me the antidote after I spill the beans, I will kill you on the spot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think for a second that you can threaten me with my son's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it comes down to it, I can always have another."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's face turned a deep shade of red, but he dared not respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled softly, a hint of amusement dancing in his eyes. "Well, Trevor, I'm always a man of my word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor nodded slightly, his expression unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know your true self is nearby because I possess a treasure&mdash;one I obtained from the depths of a divine peak. It's called the Binding Twin Pearl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a black-and-white pearl appeared in his palm, swirling with enmeshed hues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor continued, "Binding Twin Pearl has a unique property. It allows one's energy signature to bind with another's. No matter where the other person is, activating the pearl lets you teleport right to them. It's incredibly rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sadly, I didn't use it to bind my son, Kurt; I used it on someone else. Otherwise, you'd be dead by now for trying to take him! I could have appeared next to him in an instant and ended you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regarded Osborne with disdain as he finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave. "Is there really such a thing as the Binding Twin Pearl?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of relief washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness Trevor didn't bind Kurt with it. That would've been a disaster! After I knocked him out and left him in Hope Haven... if Trevor had teleported there, given his abilities, Hope Haven would have been doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He imagined his family and friends facing certain doom at Trevor's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a chill down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Looks like I can't afford to kidnap anyone lightly anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if I do, I can't keep them close or stash them in Hope Haven. Who knows if they're linked to a super-strong warrior through the Binding Twin Pearl? If so... we'd be dead in the water!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced as he turned his intense gaze on the Binding Twin Pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity piqued, Osborne asked, "So how rare are these Binding Twin Pearls?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what does your discovery of my true self having a location nearby have to do with this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor sneered at him, saying, "Patience. The Binding Twin Pearl is quite rare&mdash;only found in the very core of a divine peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that's a notoriously perilous area; even a Supernal Deity King could end up lost forever in there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's estimated that Celestara has no more than a hundred Binding Twin Pearls, but it could be more or less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Either way, they're precious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason I know your true self is close is because the Binding Twin Pearl has another ability, it can lock onto your true location through your avatars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When your Spatial Clone appeared, I already captured its essence with the Binding Twin Pearl, allowing me to determine that your true self was close by. However, you're quite skilled at hiding your energy&mdash;so much so that even the Binding Twin Pearl can only confirm you're within 50 miles. I can't pinpoint your exact location!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I wouldn't be going through all this trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The moment the Binding Twin Pearl locked onto you, I could have killed you in a heartbeat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, Trevor declared, "I've said my piece! Now, hand over the antidote and return my belongings! I swear, I won't kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Binding Twin Pearl could lock onto his true self through his avatars. Luckily, he had Eclipsing Mantra to mask his presence, throwing off the pearl's tracking ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for that, Trevor might have found him in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy weight settled in Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The methods of a Supernal Deity King are beyond my imagination! I thought having Spatial Clones and interdimensional travel would let me stand toe-to-toe with one, even daring to 'extort' a Supernal Deity King. How naive of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, it all came down to strength. He realized just how weak he truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at Trevor, his expression shifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The antidote, huh? Of course, I, Theodore, always keep my word! But right now, I don't have a ready-made antidote. I'll need to whip one up on the spot, so just give me a moment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he began to playact, pulling out a few herbs and casually rubbing them together, all the while stalling for time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor frowned, sensing something was off but saying nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the minutes ticked by, a growing unease settled over Trevor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taking too long; it was clear he was dragging his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something didn't sit right. He pressed his hand against Kurt's forehead, focusing intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Trevor's expression turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! How dare you deceive me?"</span></p></div>
