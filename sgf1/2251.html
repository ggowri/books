        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their business isn't confined to the Racial Convergence Stellar Region; it reaches out to neighboring star-systems. </span><span>The wealth and resources they have far exceed those of either the Evernight Court or the Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the Evernight Court and the Glorious Divine Kingdom are careful not to provoke the Phantom Commerce Guild. They even actively invite the Guild to do business in their territories..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, feeling the full weight of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just shocking that the Phantom Commerce Guild, which has a good reputation, is secretly involved in the slave trade."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face became solemn. "So, is the Phantom Commerce Guild really that powerful? Does that mean we have to call off our investigation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Bancroft was speaking the truth, they were truly stuck in a dead end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Phantom Commerce Guild would never admit to their part in the slave-trading business, nor would they sell out their clients by disclosing the location of the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration welled up in Osborne, and he clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd finally got a clue about his parents, only to hit a brick wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ground his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Phantom Commerce Guild... Scottie!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I don't care! This is the only lead I've got to find my parents, and I'm not backing down! The Phantom Commerce Guild may be super powerful, but that Scottie is not necessarily unbeatable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't have to go head-to-head with the Phantom Commerce Guild! If I can track down Scottie and capture him, I might be able to squeeze out information that will lead me to the Frenetic Storm Warband and my parents!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a steely determination in his eyes, Osborne shifted his gaze back to Bancroft. "What's Scottie's standing in the Phantom Commerce Guild?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft kept his cool. "So, you're thinking of skipping the Phantom Commerce Guild and going straight for Scottie? I'd strongly advise against it! Not only is Scottie an Empyrean Sacredness warrior who could crush you with ease, but his status is way out of your league!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the son of Russell Lillard, one of the three vice-presidents who heads the Guild! He's one of the most high-profile figures on Racial Convergence Planet! Wherever he goes, he's always surrounded by the top-notch guards of the Phantom Commerce Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to take him on? That's just asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face grew even gloomier, but he couldn't help sneering at Bancroft's self-satisfied look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just the son of a vice-president? What's so great about that? I'm a rightful prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom! I'll get my hands on him one day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft let out a scornful scoff. "A prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Do you think I'm stupid? There are seventeen princes in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, and I've never even heard of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just sneered, not bothering to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was true; he was the fifteenth prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. But he'd been banished over a thousand years ago and stripped of his title by his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was all in the distant past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, before heading to Racial Convergence Planet, Osborne had two goals in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He not only wanted to find his parents in this lifetime but also intended to visit the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, Osborne planned to pay his respects to his mother from his past life and, more importantly, avenge her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of murderous intent flashed across Osborne's eyes. The memory of his mother's unjust and tragic end was like a shadow that followed him. Every time Osborne remembered how helplessly he'd watched her suffer, his heart was filled with anguish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Everyone who has wronged my mother in my past life will have to face the consequences!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath to calm the seething rage inside him and then turned his attention back to Bancroft. "You said earlier that you weren't lying. I need to check if that's true..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft frowned, not liking the sound of that. "Check? How do you propose to do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a cold smile. "Easy. I'll kill you and then rummage through your memories!"</span></p></div>
