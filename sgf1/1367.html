        <h1>Chapter 1366 Death and Resurrection</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his Divine Body being ruthlessly torn apart as the surrounding spatial tide surged with an intensity that was nothing short of terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was plummeting into the depths of space, a realm where infinity stretched beyond comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the naked eye, the universe was merely a projection of space, a vast expanse of stars and galaxies. In theory, one could traverse this space and reach any corner of the cosmos in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was just theory. In reality, space was infinitely vast, and even warriors with spatial power could only navigate the stable layers of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once one fell into the deeper realms of space, one was in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew what lurked in those depths; all that was certain was that anyone who ventured into them&mdash;regardless of their strength&mdash;never returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps they were lost in the far reaches of the universe, but more likely, they met a grim fate at the hands of the terrifying entities that dwelled there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, falling into the depths of space meant near-certain doom. Even with his mastery of spatial power and his Level Six space elemental essence, he had little chance of escaping alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spatial tide might not kill him outright, but he would be forever lost in the abyss, a mere whisper in the vastness of existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trapped in this terrifying spatial tide, Osborne felt his body being drawn deeper and deeper into the unknown. His Divine Body was collapsing under the relentless force, and the tide only grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his Divine Body being comparable to a Galactic Divine Body and even stronger than that, he was utterly powerless against the tide's might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pain surged through him, overwhelming his senses and robbing him of any semblance of calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he truly felt the cold grip of death closing in, a suffocating wave of despair washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Time! If I survive this, I swear I'll make you pay! Just wait&mdash;you won't get away with this! </span><span>Ahhhh</span><span>!" he roared, his voice a mix of rage and desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the agony was too intense; it shattered his focus, leaving only a primal instinct to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't die! I haven't found my parents yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't reached </span><span>Celestara</span><span> to reunite with Isa, Clarissa, Emma, and Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Inside me is a Dimensional Microcosm, home to over four thousand Blood Demon members, not to mention my grandfather, my sister, Zoe, Yulissa... What will happen to them if I die here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clung to life with every fiber of his being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in the face of such overwhelming power, no amount of willpower could </span><span>strengthen his Divine Body enough to withstand the spatial tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Piece by piece, Osborne's Divine Flesh and Divine Bones crumbled under the relentless pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his soul, once a beacon of resilience, was being ground to dust in the chaos around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, it happened. Osborne died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the moments following his death, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having completed the fourth stage of fusion with Osborne, it could resurrect him even if his Divine Body was completely shattered and his soul crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne's broken form reappeared in the void of deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was alive again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes, gasping for breath like a fish out of water. The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had revived him, but the sensation of death lingered vividly in his mind, an indelible mark on his memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear and relief flooded his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the Lotus, he would have been gone&mdash;erased from existence, leaving behind nothing but silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, this is what death feels like," Osborne murmured, only to quickly furrow his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spatial tide surrounding him hadn't dissipated or weakened after his first death; it had grown even more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, upon his resurrection by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, his Divine Body had actually grown stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, it still couldn't withstand the power of the spatial tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Divine Body soon crumbled again, and his soul was shredded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne died once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some time, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity resurrected Osborne again, repeating the previous process. As long as Osborne couldn't find a way out, he would keep having his body and soul crushed by the spatial tide, dying and being resurrected repeatedly, until his resurrection count was exhausted, and the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would abandon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his fourth-step fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, his resurrection count reached a staggering 10 thousand times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through this Sisyphean struggle, Osborne found himself caught in an endless cycle of death and rebirth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gradually became numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spatial tide had completely sucked him into the depths of space, where there was no time, no direction, only an abyss of void and absolute darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Divine Body grew stronger with each cycle of death and resurrection, almost breaking through to Level Nine.</span></p></div>
