        <h1>Chapter 2193 Accept-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he just let Isa walk away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, thinking about Maddox's significance, he finally let out a disdainful snort. "Fine! Let's swap the hostages!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and I will engage in a fair battle to end this war once and for all! I'll defeat you and then rebuild my Malevolence Empire right here on Celestara Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one can stand in my way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you're truly the reincarnation of the God of Night, you won't be able to stop my grand plans! Anyone who dares to oppose me will meet their end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Lord Malevolence set Isa free, and Osborne released Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once free, Osborne and Maddox started walking towards each other, but the difference in their states was striking. Maddox looked utterly dejected, his face clouded with gloom, while Isa was beaming with happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were fixed on Osborne as she made her way towards him, not even bothering to glance at Maddox as she passed by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Maddox rejoined Lord Malevolence, while Isa stopped right in front of Osborne, her smile lighting up the space around them. She reached out and gently stroked his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, I don't want to call you 'Teacher' anymore. Can I just call you Osborne?" Isa asked, her voice soft and full of earnestness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne nodded. The idea of her calling him "Teacher" felt strange; after all, in his memories, it was Isa who had always been the one guiding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, he added, "Even though you say I'm the reincarnation of the God of Night, I don't feel any of that power inside me. So, please, don't think of me as the God of Night. Just see me as Osborne. I'm just Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, Isa nodded, her smile becoming even more radiant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, right in front of the billions of onlookers from the Human Alliance and the Dark Deity Legion, she stood on her tiptoes, held his face in her hands, and planted a passionate kiss on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was caught off guard by Isa's bold move and stood there, completely frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there were tens of billions of people watching!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly snapped out of his shock, wrapping his arms around her waist and passionately returning her kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, Clarissa, Emma, and Austin exchanged looks, their eyes filled with a mixture of resignation and a tinge of envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, the God of Time stood there, stunned into silence. Her face was a picture of pain as she watched Osborne and Isa locked in a passionate embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Isa declared that Osborne was the reincarnation of the God of Night, the God of Time felt her heart break into a million pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she had suspected it, the harsh truth was still unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why him... Why him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the God of Time felt as if she were falling apart. She finally understood why Isa had said that the God of Night hadn't let her down and had kept his promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because the God of Night was Osborne! He had kept his promise to marry her; it was she who hadn't appreciated it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she had chosen to divorce Osborne, hurting the God of Night in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very Osborne whom she had once looked down upon turned out to be the God of Night she had loved so deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain gnawed at her, but the past was unalterable&mdash;she and Osborne were already divorced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a cold sneer cut through the tender atmosphere between Osborne and Isa. Lord Malevolence interrupted, his voice laced with blatant disdain, "God of Night, you've truly changed! You were once so focused on power that you spurned women. But now? You're completely smitten with love?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mocking sneer, he continued, "Now, I'm more convinced than ever that I can defeat you and put an end to the chaos on Celestara Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's stop wasting time. It's high-time we settle this once and for all! In this battle, you'll meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne gently patted Isa's arm, his expression turning solemn. "Isa, stay back and wait for me. Once I've dealt with Lord Malevolence, we can have a good catch-up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to step forward to confront his enemy, Isa grabbed his arm and urgently said, "Wait! I'm going to restore the God of Night's memories to you! Merging those memories will enhance your power, increasing your chances of defeating Lord Malevolence!"</span></p></div>
