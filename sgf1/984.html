        <h1>Chapter 984 Kill Them All</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing atop the tallest building of the Lambert family's estate, Osborne weaponized his super energy pistol, methodically picking off </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins hiding within the two-mile radius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how well they concealed themselves or what cover they had, it made no difference in the face of the terrifying divine power bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne locked onto a target, the grim reaper's kiss awaited them, delivering a swift and silent end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of those bullets shattered their brains in an instant, leaving no room for screams&mdash;just quiet, invisible deaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had transformed into a fearsome sniper lurking in the night, harvesting the lives of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's elite. Each of these individuals was a Class AAA assassin, a core member of their organization. For even Class S warriors, taking down one of them was no small feat, let alone wiping them all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in Osborne's sights, they seemed weak and no different from regular people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forty down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he fired again, a frown crossed Osborne's face the moment the bullet left the chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the power lagging. Simultaneously, the Divine Bone Crystal acting as the magazine on his super energy pistol suddenly shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the divine power within that crystal had been depleted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! That bullet didn't pack enough punch to take out a Class AAA!" Osborne muttered, eyebrows furrowing with alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, he rummaged through his Dimensional Space for a new Divine Bone Crystal to replace the broken one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the divine power bullet he had just fired had already struck a hidden assassin a mile away. This assassin was lying low in the grass, waiting for the next order to attack, when the bullet found its mark, hitting him squarely in the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the bullet had held sufficient power, the assassin would have met a swift death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, this one merely left him gravely injured, allowing for a horrified scream to escape his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anguished cries tore through the night, causing the other </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins to freeze in shock as they scrambled to communicate, desperate to understand what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's been an ambush!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sniper!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wounded assassin's cries left his comrades in a state of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An ambush they could comprehend, but a sniper?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of sniper could pose a threat to Class AAA veterans like them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confusion coursed through their ranks, but they sprang into action, especially when they realized that many of their comrades were unresponsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arriving at the location of their fallen allies, they were met with horror&mdash;comrades lay lifeless, bullet holes clean through their skulls, blood and brain matter splattered everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's </span><span>an</span><span> sniper!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, every surviving </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassin activated their Stealth Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, having swapped his magazine, immediately took aim at the wounded assassin, determined to finish him off, but by then, the remaining nine assailants had </span><span>all activated their Stealth Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was a simple application of spatial power, Osborne's reliance on Satan's Eye's X-ray vision wasn't enough to expose them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!" Osborne let out a frustrated huff, feeling a pang of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was too careless! Got too caught up in the thrill of sniping and didn't check the energy left in the Divine Bone Crystal. I should have wiped out all fifty of those </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins, but now only forty-one are down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guess there are still nine left to deal with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tucked away his super energy pistol with a smirk. "Well then, looks like it's time for a little fun with you guys. Just means I'll have to put in a bit more effort."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he vanished from sight, his body blurring into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the nine remaining </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins had activated their stealth, Osborne knew they couldn't have strayed too far from their hiding spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he reappeared at the location of one of the assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold grin crept across his face. Three hundred yards to the left, in a patch of grass, he sensed a faint ripple of spatial disturbance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Stealth Art won't help you against me!" Osborne declared, gripping the Goddess of Grain's scythe tightly before vanishing once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he reemerged, he stood near the assassin's hiding place, a seemingly empty expanse before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew better&mdash;one of </span><span>Eityreia's</span><span> assassins was hiding in plain sight, utterly focused on his surroundings, completely oblivious to the lethal presence behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time's up!" Osborne announced as he swung the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he severed the assassin's head, blood spraying high into the air and splattering across the grass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the body even crumpled to the ground, Osborne was gone, having sensed the second assassin cloaked in Stealth Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's finish this!" Osborne growled, embodying the darkness as he struck down yet another assassin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they fell like shadows at dawn, their heads collecting at his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of moments, all nine </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins had been dispatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, only Scarlett and those two Class S assassins remain!"</span></p></div>
