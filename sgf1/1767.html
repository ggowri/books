        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better not go looking for Isa! And I won't tell you where she is," God of Light finally sighed, and her voice was heavy with resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time stared at her in disbelief, and his expression was rapidly cooling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anita, you've changed! After all these years of friendship, you'd choose Isa over me? This feels so foreign!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anita Torres was the name of God of Light, though few dared to use it directly. Most referred to her as God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those of equal standing could call her by name, and God of Time was clearly one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anita sighed again, and her gaze was steady on him. "Rosemary, I haven't changed! I'm doing this for your own good. You don't need to confront Isa because she truly is God of Night's disciple&mdash;and his woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this revelation, Rosemary Alvaro, the true name of God of Time, froze, her fists clenched tightly, and her beautiful face twisted in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What gives her the right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly shouted, unleashing a terrifying surge of energy that rippled through the Sanctum of Light, distorting the very fabric of time as everything flickered wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anita frowned, quickly raising her hand to summon a powerful beam of holy light that stabilized the surrounding chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rosemary, calm down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosemary laughed bitterly. "Calm down? Do you want me to calm down? How can I? Anita, don't you feel betrayed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thinking back a thousand years, what did God of Night promise us? I sacrificed everything, burned through all my strength to fight against Lord Malevolence, and entered the cycle of reincarnation! He promised that when we returned, he would accept us and marry us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what happened? When I finally emerged from reincarnation, he was nowhere to be found! Is he ashamed of me? Is it because I was married before my memories returned, and my body is now 'tainted'?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But all of this is his doing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He had the power to intervene in my reincarnation, to keep it pure, yet he chose not to. Why let me marry someone else and become 'impure'?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all his fault! What gives him the right to look down on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosemary's body trembled with rage, and her voice was filled with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rosemary, please calm down! It's not as you think! God of Night doesn't look down on you! The reason he hasn't come to see you is that he's dealing with something very important!" Anita tried to soothe her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosemary scoffed, "Anita, don't you think your explanation falls flat? Fine! Let's say he's genuinely busy with something crucial and can't meet me. But why is he accepting Isa?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I pursued him for a thousand years, and he never accepted me. He claimed he didn't want to hurt me, didn't want to drag me into his troubles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not just me, but you too, Anita. And God of Destiny, God of Life, and God of Space&mdash;aren't we all in the same boat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've all been waiting for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what's the outcome? Some of us died for him, others entered reincarnation, and some, like you, waited for a thousand years! Yet he hasn't accepted any of us, instead choosing another woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know that woman. She's Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's not pure either because she has a man on Blue Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His name is Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you furious? Not only do you refuse to help me, but you also hide the truth for that woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosemary's face was a mask of fury as she finished her outburst. Anita sighed, and her heart was heavy with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rosemary, it's really not what you think. There are reasons I can't explain everything right now, but you need to trust him. After loving him for a thousand years and waiting for him all this time, you should know the kind of person he is. He hasn't forgotten the promises he made to us. He won't forget what we've sacrificed for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What you need to do now is wait patiently for his return. He will explain everything to you personally. Besides, Dark Deity Legion led by Lord Malevolence is about to attack. Human Community is on the brink of destruction. You should focus on regaining your strength to prepare for the fight against Lord Malevolence, not chase after Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa is one of us. She's doing everything she can to help him. If you go looking for her now, you'll only mess up his plans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Rosemary let out another derisive laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One of us? Spare me! I'm not on the same side as her. And what does the fate of Human Community matter to me? If it weren't for him, why would I lift a finger for them? I've already died once for Human Community!"</span></p></div>
