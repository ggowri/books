        <h1>Chapter 2621 Heavy Casualties-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne never expected the fragrance of the Spirit-Entombing Roses to be so terrifying after blooming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, this is the millennium's thinning period of the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance is thin, it's already this terrifying. Under normal circumstances, wouldn't anyone entering Necropolis City die? They simply can't resist it unless they, like Osborne, possess an indestructible Soul Current Ocean and soul power far beyond their cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying Spirit-Entombing Fragrance continued to unleash its power, and more and more people fell. At this moment, no matter their strength or cultivation level, everyone struggled to resist the attack of the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had the strength to save others, not even Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For this kind of Soul Attack, Osborne could only protect himself and couldn't help at all. Fortunately, Clara, Leroy, Adriana, and May were doing fine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were surrounded by the blue Spirit-Entombing Fragrance, continuously enduring its Soul Attack. Although their faces were pale, they were still holding on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only May was in the worst condition, with blood already trickling from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this continues, perhaps everyone will collapse because of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A total of about five hundred people entered Necropolis City, including three hundred royal guards, fifty royal members, fifty strong individuals from various forces who reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, and one hundred participants like Osborne who had not reached Empyrean Sacredness in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, at least one-third of these five hundred people had already collapsed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were beyond saving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, people kept collapsing every moment, unable to withstand the Soul Attack of the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance. As the blue Spirit-Entombing Fragrance gathered and grew thicker, more and more people could not resist it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this continues, no one will be able to withstand the fragrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, what Osborne worried about did not happen. Soon, the blue Spirit-Entombing Fragrance around everyone stabilized, and no more appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone gradually adapted to the attack of the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance and regained their composure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By this time, over two hundred people had fallen to the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nearly half of the people died under the Soul Attack of the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance. Their soul power was directly obliterated, and the Soul Current Ocean shattered completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the survivors looked extremely angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also seemed quite dissatisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the hundred participants in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, over forty had already died, nearly half of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ones who died the most were the royal guards. Among the three hundred royal guards, nearly half perished, all of whom had reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a hundred people who reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection could almost wipe out most of the First-rate Powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even someone like Adriana, who has reached Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, would need to flee when facing the siege of a hundred Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection experts, and she might not even escape successfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, now, they are all dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, six royal princes and princesses have already passed away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seven Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness experts from various major forces have died.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's right. Seven of them have already perished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, even Osborne couldn't help but take a deep breath. After entering Necropolis City, they hadn't done anything yet, but nine Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness experts had already died.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number of dead has already exceeded two-fifths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Frederick looked furious, as if he hadn't expected the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance's attack to be this powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick was surrounded by an incredibly dense blue Spirit-Entombing Fragrance, making him seem like a giant blue figure. His cultivation level and strength were the highest, so he attracted the most Spirit-Entombing Fragrance attacks.</span></p></div>
