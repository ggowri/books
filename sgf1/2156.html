        <h1>Chapter 2145 Activating the Ascending Sacred Sanctum</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne approached the cave, his eyes fell upon the Sublime Concealment Orb lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized it immediately, thanks to the descriptions in Chuck's Heavenly Compendium of All Beings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "Is that the Sublime Concealment Orb?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Isidore's soul could move undetected across the Umbra Earth. It must have been this orb that kept him safe from the continent's rules!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sublime Concealment Orb was a unique treasure, primarily designed to mask energy signatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was similar to the Eclipsing Mantra he had practiced before</span><span>,</span><span> but with a critical difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne broke through to the Deity King level, the Eclipsing Mantra had lost its effectiveness. There might be stronger concealment techniques out there, but none could hide an energy signature from an Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the Sublime Concealment Orb could!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this orb in his possession, even if he stood before an Empyrean Sacredness warrior, he could obscure his true energy signature and alter how he presented his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such power, combined with the orb's rarity, made it incredibly valuable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinning as he held the orb, Osborne thought, "Isidore, you've just handed me another gem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was worried that, as an Empyrean Sacredness warrior, you might find me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with this orb, even if I stood right in front of you, you might not recognize me! You think you can track me down? Keep dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne absorbed the Sublime Concealment Orb into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, his energy signature shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his will, Osborne manipulated his cultivation level, shifting it from Ascension Three to Ascension Four, then to Ascension Five, and finally settling at Ascension Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect!" Osborne felt a surge of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, even someone who knew him well wouldn't be able to identify him just by his energy signature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to claim the Ascending Sacred Sanctum!" Osborne declared, shaking off his earlier doubts as he ventured deeper into the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The structure was in shambles, trembling as if it might collapse at any moment, remnants of destruction littering the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he passed the spot where Alfreda had perished, a wave of sorrow washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip, standing still for what felt like an eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, with a heavy sigh, he crouched down and scooped up a handful of dirt, tucking it away in his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda sacrificed herself by self-detonating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the terrifying explosion, not even a shred of her body remained; she vanished completely. Osborne thought that the dirt might very well be tainted with Alfreda's blood and flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of their time together flooded his mind, her playful smile and petite, alluring figure flashing before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear, I will kill Isidore!" Osborne vowed through gritted teeth, pushing his grief aside as he pressed onward deeper into the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he reached the innermost chamber, where the Ascending Sacred Sanctum lay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite its battered state, it still emanated an aura of grandeur, cloaked in deep purples and blacks, exuding an air of nobility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire cave seemed to have been carved out by the force of the Sanctum itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, feeling a mix of confusion and curiosity, "What kind of being could have damaged the Ascending Sacred Sanctum like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what does the endless sea of bones in the Skeletal Wasteland have to do with it?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First things first, I need to see if I can activate this Sanctum. Thankfully, Isidore shared the activation method with me, or I wouldn't have a clue how to work a Sacred Artifact-level palace like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, where's the energy core of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then stepped cautiously into the heart of the Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the devastation outside, the interior of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum remained relatively intact. Osborne quickly made his way to the core area, where he discovered the heart of the Sanctum: an intricate, honeycomb-like apparatus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his dismay, it was completely devoid of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's lost all its power! Looks like the Ascending Sacred Sanctum has been lying dormant here for ages. If someone else tried to activate it, even knowing how, they'd likely fail... It requires a Sacred Crystal! Only by embedding a Sacred Crystal into the </span><span>energy core can the Sanctum be brought back to life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rarity of Sacred Crystals was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a normal person, activating the Ascending Sacred Sanctum would be nearly impossible because of this requirement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had a different situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the depths of the Corrosive Marsh, after breaking through to the Sacredness Level with his Satan's Eye, he had stumbled upon a Sacred Crystal vein, ultimately acquiring more than fifty thousand Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, all of them were stored inside the interior space of his Satan's Eye, waiting to be assimilated into energy for advancing his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne activated the Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ocular energy flickered, and before him manifested a hundred Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! To activate the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, I'll need to embed at least a hundred Sacred Crystals into the core."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pang of regret tugged at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred Sacred Crystals were enough for an ordinary Supernal Deity King to ascend from Ascension One all the way to Ascension Six&mdash;or even break through to Ascension Seven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, all he could use them for now was to activate the Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is basically a money pit!" Osborne grumbled, yet he dutifully embedded the hundred Sacred Crystals into the energy core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, following the activation method, he dripped a drop of his blood into the core and then channeled his own energy into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the energy core erupted in a brilliant light that enveloped Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if a connection had formed between him and the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, allowing him to sense its condition within his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with just a thought, Osborne could control the Sanctum according to his will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could command it to fly, attack, or defend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, disaster struck as he realized just how severely damaged the Ascending Sacred Sanctum was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered incredulously, "Ninety-nine percent of the attack and defense runes are destroyed?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seventy percent of the propulsion runes destroyed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the Sanctum was left with the most basic forms of attack capabilities. Its defense was only one percent of its peak strength, and its speed barely reached thirty percent of what it used to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mix of frustration and sorrow washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "This is a Sacred Artifact-level palace, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who has done this to it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, it's no use being greedy. If it were in perfect condition, it wouldn't have been left here unclaimed for so long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And let's remember, it's still a Sacred Artifact-level palace! Even in this state, it's incredibly powerful! With the Ascending Sacred Sanctum at my disposal, I'll have a </span><span>much better chance against Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single thought, the immense Ascending Sacred Sanctum shook violently in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sanctum slowly lifted into the air, encapsulated by a swirling purple-black Sacred Power shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood atop the highest point of the Sanctum, feeling its might course through him, his expression fierce and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The exploration of Umbra Earth must come to an end! It's time for me to return to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence, here I come!"</span></p></div>
