        <h1>Chapter 2475 Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive voice echoed in Osborne's mind, leaving him dizzy and disoriented. His Soul Current Ocean rippled violently, even slowing </span><span>his </span><span>speed</span><span> to</span><span> react, allowing the opponent to close the gap further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face looked grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This person claimed that as long as Osborne handed over the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, he wouldn't kill him. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In reality, he launched a Soul Attack on Osborne. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne's Soul Current Ocean </span><span>were not</span><span> strong and stable enough, with the Primordial and Warfare Ancient Tree fused within, holding the fort, he might have already fallen for it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This person never intended to let him live!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth, quickly thinking of a </span><span>way out</span><span>, his heart filled with urgency.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Osborne knew that the person w</span><span>as not entirely wrong</span><span>. He had indeed burned his blood essence, doubling his speed. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this rate, within a dozen </span><span>second</span><span>s, th</span><span>at person</span><span> really could catch up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What to do?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't think of a solution for the moment. If he were caught by this Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, he'd be in big trouble. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his current strength, even with Flash, he was definitely no match for the opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he summoned Drum and all of Drum's pets, they might still not be a match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne wasn't particularly anxious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he still had his final trump card &mdash; Drum of Empress Kira!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Empress Kira said that as long as I take good care of Drum, she will ensure my safety! If it really comes down to a life-and-death situation, Empress Kira should appear to save me! And with Empress Kira's strength...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A mere Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection</span><span> </span><span>should </span><span>mean nothing to her</span><span>, right? But Empress Kira almost exhausted all her strength to nurture Drum and </span><span>was</span><span> now in slumber... </span><span>Unless </span><span>necessary, it's better not to disturb her!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I must find a way to solve it myself!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continu</span><span>ed</span><span> to run desperately, but he could clearly feel the person behind him getting closer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, that person's voice echoed in Osborne's mind again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, it seems you're unwilling to surrender! In that case, don't blame me for being ruthless! Once I catch you, I'll make you regret being alive! </span><span>You made me</span><span> burn </span><span>my </span><span>blood essence, you're dead for sure!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, the person</span><span> sped up</span><span> once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt even more pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne suddenly felt that </span><span>there was something unusual in the environment.</span><span> </span><span>It felt</span><span> much stickier, </span><span>as if</span><span> a strange force </span><span>was </span><span>pulling </span><span>at him</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Huh? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very surprised and immediately looked in the direction of the pulling force. Then, his mouth dropped open, his face full of shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What did he see?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw a surging, rolling river rushing into the distance. The river was so immense that its width and length were impossible to discern, like a massive, radiant ribbon spanning across the deep space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And everything around seemed to be drawn to it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those small Chrono-Spatial Turbulences, originally heading in different directions, were now drawn to it, eventually converging </span><span>into a single flow</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An immensely massive Chrono-Spatial Turbulence!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>A</span><span> Chrono-Spatial Turbulence</span><span> this </span><span>massive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned. He had been to deep space many times and spent quite a while there, but he had never seen such a massive and terrifying Chrono-Spatial Turbulence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence where the Warfare Ancient Tree was discovered wasn't one-tenth the size of this one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It might not even be one percent!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at this Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, Osborne actually felt a sense of dread. Even with his spatial power, he was terrified of those frightening temporal-spatial waves.</span></p></div>
