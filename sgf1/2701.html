        <h1>Chapter 2573 Chaos Battle</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Seraphina truly shattered Mason's strongest attack with a single move and even defeated him, blasting him off the stage, countless people let out shocked voices.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Seraphina only used her own Sacred Power and combat skills, without relying on the power of a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her strength is terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although everyone knew Seraphina was definitely stronger than Mason, no one could have imagined that Mason, ranked tenth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, couldn't even withstand a single barehanded move from Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gap between them is simply enormous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, all the contestants who stood out from the zone duel had their mouths wide open, faces full of shock and disbelief, exclaiming, "She's too strong!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had interacted with Mason before at the Empire Hotel and were well aware of how strong Mason was, knowing he was definitely the strongest among them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Mason was defeated by the barehanded Seraphina in just one move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Doesn't this prove that they would face the same result against Seraphina, unable to withstand even a single move?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's strength is terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy's expressions were extremely serious as they said in unison, "She's very strong!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile and said, "Hmm, she's quite strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not bad?" Clara and Leroy looked at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Is her strength just "not bad"? The power Seraphina displayed is probably stronger than most mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors. Moreover, she didn't use any weapons.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she used a Sacred Artifact, her strength would definitely be comparable to that of an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior. However, in Osborne's eyes, her strength is just "not bad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then how big do you think the gap between our strength and hers is?" Clara and Leroy were both curiously looking at Osborne, wanting to know what kind of evaluation they would receive in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and said, "You're not bad either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Clara and Leroy became very excited. Their eyes were filled with joy, but they said nothing more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in the area where the Royal Family members of the Glorious Divine Kingdom were located, Frederick was also watching the battle on the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although this level of battle seemed like child's play to him and was hardly worth mentioning, as an Emperor, even if he had to pretend, he still had to feign great interest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Frederick smiled and said, "Seraphina's strength has improved again. Not bad!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Callista smiled and said, "She is indeed impressive. When I was at Seraphina's current cultivation level, I wasn't this strong. Even your strength at that time was about the same. I reckon Seraphina will smoothly win the championship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is all thanks to Liliane's excellent teaching. Liliane's son Hendrix is also outstanding; he's already at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, close to reaching Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. His strength is about to catch up with mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Liliane mentioned by Callista is another wife of Frederick, named Liliane Augustine, and the biological mother of Hendrix and Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Liliane was sitting right behind them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Callista's words, she smiled and said, "Queen Callista, thank you for your praise. Compared to you, I'm still far behind. Everyone knows that under your guidance, Weston's strength has already surpassed all of us and is catching up with our husband."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, Queen Callista, your other two children, Lorenzo and Lilith, have already reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection at just a thousand years old and are about to catch up with Hendrix. You are truly remarkable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Liliane's words, Callista felt very happy because she enjoyed hearing others praise her children.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston, Lorenzo, and Lilith are her pride.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But on the surface, she had to humbly say, "Liliane, you're too modest. Also, compared to our husband, Weston is still far behind. Even Quinn is no worse than Weston."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she glanced at another woman behind her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was Quinn's biological mother, Joanne Augustine. Feeling Callista's gaze, Joanne calmly said, "Quinn is still far behind, not as good as Weston."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, stop complimenting each other," Frederick interrupted them and said calmly, "They are all excellent. But it's too early to say who's better. Let's see how they perform after entering Necropolis City this time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Frederick's words, the women immediately fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far from them, in the area where the princes and princesses gathered, Hendrix's face was full of pride and smugness. "Did you see that? That's my sister."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it weren't for participating in this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, Seraphina could have reached Empyrean Sacredness over a hundred years ago. She will definitely be the champion of this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. I don't think anyone can withstand her three moves."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Hendrix's face was full of pride.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other princes and princesses looked at Hendrix with some displeasure, feeling he was too arrogant. After all, some of the other eight contestants were their brothers and sisters, so they were naturally unconvinced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A princess said coldly, "Hendrix, you can say that Seraphina is very likely to win the championship. However, if you claim that no one can withstand her three moves, you're being overly confident and arrogant. Seraphina is indeed strong, but the other eight princes and princesses are not weak either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They have also suppressed their cultivation level for a long time for this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. My brother Emiliano could have reached Empyrean Sacredness two hundred years ago. Over these two centuries, his affinity with his Sacred Artifact has reached a very high level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although he hasn't reached Empyrean Sacredness yet, he can fully unleash the power of a Legendary Sacred Artifact. The combat skills he has learned have also reached a very high level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although Emiliano may not necessarily defeat Seraphina, it would be extremely difficult for Seraphina to defeat Emiliano, let alone in just three moves."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, Hendrix smiled and said, "Emiliano won't do. His talent is too low. No matter what he does, he can't be a match for Seraphina. It would be impressive if he could withstand three moves from her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then we'll see," the princess snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay." Saying this, Hendrix looked at Weston, Quinn, and Naomi sitting in front of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the three of them were slightly closing their eyes, seemingly completely indifferent to the situation on the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this scene, Hendrix snorted coldly, his eyes filled with fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just wait. I will soon reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. Everyone says only the three of you are qualified to compete for the next Emperor's position, but I refuse to accept that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When I reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I will definitely compete with you. And this trip to Necropolis City is my chance. I will seize the greatest opportunity in Necropolis City, just like Solomon gained the power of Necropolis City. I will surpass you and crush you all underfoot."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Hendrix withdrew his gaze and continued watching the battle on the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the melee of the second group had already begun.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano, ranked second on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, chose a completely different fighting style from Seraphina. He quickly defeated all his opponents and knocked them off the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he was the only one left on the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strength he displayed was no weaker than Seraphina's. This made Hendrix let out a cold snort, his face full of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">When you face Seraphina, you'll know who's stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the battles of the third, fourth, and fifth groups continued.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, it was the turn of the ninth group, and Clara was about to fight.</span></p></div>
