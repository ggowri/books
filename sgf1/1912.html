        <h1>Chapter 1911 Trapped</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's here! Don't let him escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that command, four beams of light shot up into the sky from the four corners of Wild Flame City, converging above and scattering into a translucent barrier that enveloped the entire city in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After executing their plan, the warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan emerged from their hiding spots, a cold smirk etched on their faces as they approached the floating mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them proclaimed, "Theodore, today's the day you die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All of you from the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings will perish here! Not even your Gods of Night and Light can save you now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, confusion washing over him as he observed these figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shimmering barrier seemed to be a technique designed to suppress spatial power, rendering the surrounding energy static.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his space elemental essence at Level Eight peak, casting spatial power would be an uphill battle under this barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne had already broken through to Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The barrier would only force him to expend more energy; it wouldn't cripple his abilities entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "What's the point of this barrier?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do they really believe they can trap me with just this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Don't they know I have a Spatial Clone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They can't even be sure if my real body is nearby, and yet they've revealed their hand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Paramount Supreme Clan members seem less clever than Trevor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least Trevor used the Binding Twin Pearl's unique ability to confirm my real presence before activating the Universe-Sealing Formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surely, the Paramount Supreme Clan has something similar?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why haven't they checked if I'm the real deal or just a clone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain his thoughts, Osborne called out, "Are you guys really this clueless? You think this is enough to take me down? That's just naive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paramount Supreme Clan warriors exchanged glances, their expressions darkening at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder among them sneered, saying, "Theodore, you're still cocky even when death is at your doorstep? You think we can't kill you just because you showed up as a Spatial Clone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank. He thought, "So they know I'm just a clone. But how can they be so confident?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do they have other tricks up their sleeves? This isn't a good sign!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder's cold laughter echoed in the air. "What's wrong? Are you scared? The methods of the Paramount Supreme Clan are beyond your imagination! Engaging with us is the most foolish decision you've ever made!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, just prepare to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of dread washed over Osborne, sharpening his instincts. Without a moment's hesitation, he replied coolly, "If you're too chicken to let your young talents face me in a fair fight, then I won't stick around for this charade. Goodbye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he commanded his Spatial Clone to self-destruct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clone shattered into a flurry of spatial energy, vanishing before the eyes of the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next moment, Osborne's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His soul power couldn't return to his main body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of his Spatial Clones was connected to him through a thread of soul power. Normally, when a clone was destroyed or dismissed, that power would flow back into his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as his Spatial Clone dissipated, that thread of soul power was trapped within Wild Flame City, ensnared in the translucent barrier, unable to return to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization deepened Osborne's unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Paramount Supreme Clan couldn't help but chuckle, their disdain evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder among them stepped forward, eyes glinting with contempt. "Theodore, how does it feel right now? I warned you that our methods in the Paramount Supreme Clan are beyond your imagination! Did you really think that just sending a Spatial Clone would keep you safe? That we would be powerless against you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You're incredibly naive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Adolph Eldridge, a metahuman with soul power and the Ascension Two Supernal Deity King. At this very moment, a fragment of your soul power is trapped by me. No matter where your true self hides, my Divine Ascendance Technique can still reach you through this essence and bring about your demise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift movement of his hand, Osborne's soul fragment, still under Adolph's control, was yanked towards him, suspended in the air before Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph said, relishing the moment, "The leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings&mdash;Theodore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, brace yourself and experience the depths of pain and death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Ascendance Technique... Soul Spark Oblivion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Adolph's voice echoed through the tense atmosphere, a terrifying wave of energy enveloped Osborne's soul fragment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Burn!" he commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a blazing inferno ignited around Osborne's soul fragment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames, fueled by his very soul, crackled violently, radiating golden light as they danced wildly in the air.</span></p></div>
