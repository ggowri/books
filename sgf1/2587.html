        <h1>Chapter 2479 Take the Void Sword-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt unwilling in his heart. This was a Supreme Sacred Artifact capable of controlling the void. Now, with Lionel's mark gone, it had become a masterless sword, floating right in front of him, yet he couldn't take it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He secretly made up his mind. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Before leaving, I must find a way to take the Void Sword. A perfectly intact Supreme Sacred Artifact is absolutely not to be missed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps the Warfare Ancient Tree ha</span><span>d</span><span> a solution. </span><span>He</span><span> c</span><span>ould</span><span>n't touch this Void Sword, firstly because Lionel tampered with it, and secondly because </span><span>his</span><span> own strength </span><span>was</span><span> insufficient, </span><span>and his</span><span> cultivation level </span><span>wa</span><span>s too low.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Warfare Ancient Tree </span><span>was</span><span> different. Any Sacred Artifact c</span><span>ould</span><span> be hung on it to be nurtured and cultivated, even the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, which </span><span>wa</span><span>s also a Supreme Sacred Artifact. And once a Sacred Artifact </span><span>wa</span><span>s attached to the tree, it c</span><span>ould</span><span> no longer release its power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree possesse</span><span>d</span><span> the power to suppress all Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne immediately began trying to communicate with the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For him, although the Warfare Ancient Tree was excellent in many aspects, its intelligence was relatively low, making communication with it far less effortless than with the Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, after some effort, he finally understood the meaning of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It can do it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This discovery thrilled Osborne. He quickly scanned the surroundings, saw Lionel and the others fiercely battling with no one paying attention to him, and decisively ordered the Warfare Ancient Tree to take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A jet-black branch swiftly extended from Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a branch of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It twisted and turned like vines or ropes, flexible and agile, instantly appearing before the Void Sword and tightly wrapping around it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Void Sword sensed the anomaly and immediately tried to shake free, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment it was entangled by the Warfare Ancient Tree's branch, the Void Sword's glow suddenly dimmed, ceasing all struggle as if completely subdued.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, the Warfare Ancient Tree's branch swiftly retreated into Osborne's body, vanishing silently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, in Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, the Warfare Ancient Tree had an additional sword&mdash;the Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Void Sword hung quietly on the Warfare Ancient Tree, alongside the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, Warfare Shield, Warfare Scythe, and Bloodwrought Bow, motionless like fruits on the tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at the Void Sword on the Warfare Ancient Tree, a faint smile appearing at the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It worked. I really hit the jackpot this time. Now it's time to leave!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne, taking advantage of no one noticing, quickly left the battlefield and disappeared from everyone's sight along the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Lionel's battle with the others grew increasingly intense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel was gradually falling behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he was fighting over a dozen enemies alone. More importantly, his only Supreme Sacred Artifact, the Void Sword, had its imprint erased and was temporarily unusable. He could only rely on two Legendary Sacred Artifacts to fight, making it hard for him to fully unleash his strength. Otherwise, he would never be in such a sorry state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No, I must reclaim the Void Sword. With it in hand, these people can't hurt me, and I can escape more easily, leaving them far behind!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Lionel looked toward the direction of the Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the Void Sword was gone. In the chaos of the battle, he had no idea who had taken his weapon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in his view, that person was definitely not Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, with Osborne's strength and cultivation level, it was impossible for him to quietly take the Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel felt a surge of anger, but when he remembered Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge in his Dimensional Bag, his emotions gradually calmed down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Void Sword is gone, so be it. At least I got the Kingdom Duel Badge. Since the Void Sword is no longer here, there's no point in staying. Escaping is the priority!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Lionel stopped entangling with others and fled frantically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those opponents naturally wouldn't let him go and immediately gave chase, with no one paying attention to Osborne's whereabouts.</span></p></div>
