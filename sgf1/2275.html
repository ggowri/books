        <h1>Chapter 2239 Farewell-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Adriana's intense stare, Osborne was filled with a sense of indecision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the top-notch super warrior on the Racial Convergence Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could become her disciple, even just a nominal one, he could bypass numerous obstacles and speed up his growth by leaps and bounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, being in Adriana's sphere of influence would allow him to stay close to Isa, Clarissa, and the others for a long time without being separated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for the generous offer, Ms. Alba! I'm used to my free-spirited ways and don't want to be restricted. I'd rather not let you down, so I'll have to decline..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left Angela and her fellow practitioners </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne just turned down Ms. Alba!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does he even know what he's missing out on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does he realize how hard-to-come-by it is to be a registered disciple of Adriana? Even Empyrean Sacredness warriors would fight like hell for this opportunity, and he just walked away from it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy's </span><span>gonna</span><span> live to regret this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's lost his marbles! Passing up the chance to be Ms. Alba's registered disciple! If it were me, I'd jump at it without a second thought, no matter what."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amber said, "Sure, he's an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King at the moment, and his strength is on par with Clarissa and Emma. But it won't be long before they leave him in the dust. Isa... she'll reach a whole new level that he'll never be able to catch up with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Anastasia and Zoe will quickly close the gap and leave him in their wake for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By turning down Ms. Alba, he's basically throwing away his future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela and her practitioners shook their heads in disbelief, convinced that Osborne would come to regret his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana, taken aback by his refusal, didn't push the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded and said, "I respect your choice! But I hope you won't breathe a word about their talents to anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly gave his assurance. "Don't worry, Ms. Alba! My lips are sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd like to ask you to look after them well and teach them diligently. Please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Osborne bowed deeply to Adriana, his face solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Clarissa, and the others were deeply touched as they watched him bow to Adriana, asking her to take good care of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes welled up with tears, and they were filled with a sense of reluctance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed them a smile and waved. "It's time for you to go! Head to the Fairy Moon Sect with Ms. Alba! That's where you'll really make your mark! Take good care of yourselves and don't worry about me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be here waiting for all of you to level up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you're all big shots on the Racial Convergence Planet, don't forget about me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm relying on you guys to have my back when you're famous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words made their eyes redden even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they stepped forward and hugged Osborne tightly, holding on to him sorrowfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Adriana could sense the strong bond among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the top-notch super warrior on the Racial Convergence Planet, she kept quiet and patiently waited as they bid each other farewell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her thoughts, she knew this separation might mean they wouldn't see each other for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they did meet again, they might be in different leagues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under her guidance, Isa, Clarissa, Anastasia, and the others would level up quickly and soon become the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of warriors on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p></div>
