        <h1>Chapter 2299 Out of Your Team-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was in a total panic. Without a second thought, she whipped out her terminal, dying to get in touch with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her face went even whiter than a sheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terminal couldn't make a connection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara had no clue if it was because Osborne had really kicked the bucket and his terminal was out of reach, or if the brutal environment on the sixth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm was screwing up all the comms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only cross her fingers </span><span>that </span><span>it was the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right then, Clara was up </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>creek without a paddle. She just didn't have the chops to enter the sixth layer, so there was no way she could go looking for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hell, even on the fifth layer, she couldn't stick around for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she and Osborne weren't super close, they were teammates, after all. Clara couldn't help but be worried sick. She didn't even have the heart to look for tokens anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, for the love of God, be okay!" In the end, Clara could only mumble those words under her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath, gathered her wits, and got back to scouring for tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no use fretting. All she could do was hope and pray that Osborne was safe and sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Leroy was furrowing </span><span>her</span><span> </span><span>brows, her eyes glued to the leaderboard. Osborne's score hadn't changed a bit, and her worry was mounting by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a voice snapped, dripping with irritation, "Leroy, what the heck are you up to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been bringing in the least </span><span>amount</span><span> of tokens lately. Why are you so out of it? Can't you just focus on finding those tokens?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our team's dropped to fifteenth place! The gap between us and the top ten is getting wider. This is the time for everyone to step up their game, and here you are, just gawking at your badge. What's so interesting about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy who was speaking marched right up to Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a good-looking dude and the team leader. This team was composed of top-notch disciples from the Eight Great Academies. Each academy had sent its best student to vie for a spot in the top ten of the state </span><span>duel</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy was Jared Monroe, ranked twenty-eighth on the strength leaderboard. He was the highest-ranked among the disciples from the Eight Great Academies, which was exactly why he'd been tapped as the team leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy and the other teammates weren't allowed to log the tokens they found on their own. They had to hand them over to Jared, and he'd add them to his own score.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, Leroy had been coming up with way fewer tokens than the rest. It was obvious her mind was somewhere else, and Jared was starting to lose his patience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, confronted with Jared's accusations, Leroy frowned, a flash of resentment in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jared, watch your mouth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm on this team because the elders at my academy asked me to give you a hand, not </span><span>'cause</span><span> I signed up willingly or because you bribed me with Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think you can boss me around just because you're the leader! If you're not happy with me, I can split from this team anytime!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared's face darkened. He stared daggers at Leroy, his voice as cold as ice. "Leroy, you </span><span>wanna</span><span> quit the team? You really think we can't make it without you? That we'll be begging you to stay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy let out a bitter laugh. "In that case, there's no point in talking anymore! From this second on, I'm out of your team! We're through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Leroy spun around and walked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared's face twisted in a fit of rage. "Leroy, you wouldn't have the guts! You really think you can pull this off without getting in hot water with your academy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy stopped in her tracks, a look of inner turmoil flashing across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy, if your leaving makes the Eight Great Academies fail to snag even one spot in the top ten, they'll be hopping mad. The heat's </span><span>gonna</span><span> land right on Azure Haven Academy, and on you, of all people!" Jared growled menacingly.</span></p></div>
