        <h1>Chapter 2039 It Was Osborne</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected that the person standing before them would betray the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Tanner, the head of the Jackson family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, three hundred Supernal Deity Kings from the Jackson family quickly gathered around Tanner, standing shoulder to shoulder with him, their disdain for the Human Community warriors palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce battle around them came to an abrupt halt, as the atmosphere shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community had originally fielded a thousand Supernal Deity Kings, matching the numbers of Lord Malevolence's forces. But with the Jackson family's betrayal, the Human Community was left with only seven hundred warriors from the Hudson family, the HeartUnited Alliance, and the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast, Lord Malevolence's forces, bolstered by the Jackson family, now numbered a staggering thirteen hundred Supernal Deity Kings&mdash;almost double!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounded by this overwhelming force, the remaining warriors from the Human Community felt the weight of despair settle over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces reflected a mix of fear and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian roared, his voice cutting through the tension, "Damn it, Tanner! You've betrayed the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You scoundrel! I once considered you a friend! Tanner, you've proven me wrong! How could you turn your back on us after everything the esteemed God of Light has done to support your family? Has your conscience been devoured by dogs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I regret ever calling you my friend! If I'd known you would betray the Human Community, I would have taken your head off myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's furious tirade left Jethro beside him utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, Osborne had warned him that there were traitors among them, and they had all suspected Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed he was the most likely to have betrayed the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had considered Tanner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Jethro realized they had been mistaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, for all his impulsiveness and arrogance, hadn't betrayed them. The true traitor was Tanner, someone they had never seen coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Tanner scoffed, unfazed by Julian's outburst. "Julian, don't be foolish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community has no future, no hope!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as the esteemed Lord Malevolence is around, we'll never reclaim Celestara! Our best bet is to surrender to him as soon as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community can only survive as a vassal of the Paramount Supreme Clan! Stubborn resistance will only lead to our slaughter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're smart, you'll surrender too! For the sake of our past friendship, I can recommend you to the Paramount Supreme Clan! Once the esteemed Lord Malevolence fully occupies Celestara and claims it as his domain, your status won't be any lower than it is now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you don't surrender soon, it'll be too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're likely to die here today, and the few hundred Supernal Deity Kings from the HeartUnited Alliance will perish because of your obstinacy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, give it up already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner's calm words only deepened Julian's fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted in anger as he spat at Tanner, his voice dripping with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'd ever betray the Human Community like you? You think I'm a coward, just like your lot? The warriors of the HeartUnited Alliance aren't like the spineless fools of the Jackson family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if the Human Community is truly hopeless, the HeartUnited Alliance is part of it! Every single warrior in the HeartUnited Alliance stands with the Human Community! We're ready to fight until our last drop of blood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as we're alive, Lord Malevolence will never rule Celestara! You traitors will always be our enemies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Julian's voice thundered through the chaos, the warriors of the HeartUnited Alliance erupted with fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are the strength of the Human Community! Every single one of us stands with it! We formed the HeartUnited Alliance to resist the tyranny of Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betray the Human Community? Join forces with Lord Malevolence? We'd rather die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Jackson family are nothing but cowards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trash like the Jackson family? We'll never rest until every traitor to the Human Community is dealt with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'd rather die standing than live on our knees!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Supernal Deity Kings of the HeartUnited Alliance shouted passionately, their faces flushed with excitement. At that moment, they felt no fear&mdash;only a fierce determination and burning hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro watched in astonishment, as if seeing Julian for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was moved by his words. "You're right! We, the Hudson family, would rather die standing than live on our knees!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tanner, you traitor to the Human Community, you'll pay for this! You'll get what's coming to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner's expression finally darkened, his teeth clenched in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fools! The price you'll pay is steep! Since you refuse to surrender and would rather die standing, then let's make it happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll all meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tanner turned to Icy Six, bowing slightly. "The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are dead! If these stubborn fools refuse to surrender to the esteemed Lord Malevolence, then they deserve to be wiped out! Give the order to attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner's gaze was filled with anticipation as he looked at Icy Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six couldn't help but chuckle. "I never expected it would be you who betrayed the Human Community, aligning yourself with Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought it would be Julian!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Turns out I misjudged him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cullen, I owe you an apology. Based on your words today, I should have recognized your true character! In the past, I was too rash, and I hope that from now on, we can coexist peacefully and unite against Lord Malevolence and the Dark Deity Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Icy Six finished speaking, an eerie silence enveloped the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every Supernal Deity King from the Human Community stood frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Supernal Deity Kings under Lord Malevolence were equally baffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six's words were utterly absurd!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what struck them most was the tone of his voice&mdash;it didn't sound like Icy Six at all; it sounded like Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as their shock deepened, Icy Six's features began to shift, transforming swiftly until he bore the unmistakable visage of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came Icy Seven, then Icy Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one revealed to be an avatar of Osborne, their faces morphing back to his likeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner's eyes widened in disbelief. "You! You! You're not Icy Six?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of Osborne's avatars smiled, "Of course not! Icy Six and the others are waiting for you in hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're so eager to find him, I'll make sure you get your wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon, you'll join them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipse of Eternity! Absolute forbidden zone!"</span></p></div>
