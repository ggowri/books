        <h1>Chapter 2696 Alfreda's Resurrection</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa and Clarissa both knew Osborne had the ability to resurrect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could not only resurrect himself after death but also help others come back to life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Adriana didn't know.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, when Osborne started to act, Adriana went to Isa's side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She whispered, "Isa, what's Osborne doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa reflexively called Adriana "Ms. Alba," then realized it was no longer necessary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She explained, "Adriana, Osborne is probably reviving someone important to him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Revive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana widened her eyes. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Literally!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa replied calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, she was still a bit annoyed with Adriana because she secretly flirted with Osborne, even though Adriana was her teacher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa was a bit upset.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what&rsquo;s done is done, and there&rsquo;s nothing she can do about it. After all, she was in a similar situation back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Austin and Clarissa were Osborne's first and second women.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, Clarissa could accept her, so she could certainly accept Adriana too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, Osborne already had plenty of women.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before this, there were already five. Adding one more to make six doesn&rsquo;t seem like a big deal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most important thing is, they all know that even if the five of them take turns making love with Osborne, they still can't satisfy him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne cared for them, so he didn&rsquo;t want to see them suffer. Every time they begged for mercy, Osborne would immediately stop and let them go. They felt both touched and distressed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, they could easily accept Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least Adriana is stronger than Osborne. Clearly, Adriana can satisfy Osborne better than they can.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Literal meaning?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana didn&rsquo;t care much about Isa&rsquo;s attitude, after all, she felt guilty. She still clung to Isa, asking questions, determined to figure it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa was also a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't realized before that Adriana was so stubborn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, she had no choice after being pestered and explained, "Osborne has a special ability to replicate others' life essence! Even if someone dies, they can be revived through the life essence!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One of Osborne's very important friends died before, sacrificing herself to shield him from a warrior's attack! But back then, Osborne's cultivation level was too low to revive her. Now, Osborne is bringing her back to life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Isa finished speaking, Adriana was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne has a special ability to replicate others' life essence and revive them?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana even thought Isa was lying to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dead can come back to life?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But seeing Isa's serious expression, along with Clarissa, Emma, Anastasia, and the others looking serious too, she had to believe it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had already activated the ability of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and started reviving Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alfreda was killed, her strength was at Ascension Four Supernal Deity King Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Osborne's strength was at Ascension One Supernal Deity King Level, while Isidore, who killed Alfreda, had broken through to advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore's strength far surpassed Alfreda and Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, although Osborne copied Alfreda's life essence, he simply didn't have the ability to revive her until he broke through to Empyrean Sacredness, finally making it possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne broke through, he was in a special environment, and it was also very dangerous around him. So, even though he wanted to revive Alfreda, he waited until now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, watching Alfreda's body gradually appear before him, Osborne's expression was incredibly emotional.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne would never forget that when Isidore's explosive attack was about to hit him, Alfreda stood in front of him, using her petite body to protect him. She ended her life through self-detonation but exchanged it for Osborne's survival.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for Alfreda, Osborne would have died too!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would always remember the words Alfreda said to him before she died.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, live well! If you become strong enough in the future, remember to avenge me! Make sure to kill that old bastard Isidore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, I'm sorry! I lied to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't have any trump card. I can't block Isidore's attack because I'm too weak, and he's too strong! But I know, this is the only way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Two people dying is better than one, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So I lied to you! I can only use my life to block this attack from Isidore for you! You must live on. You must become the strongest being in the cosmos and avenge me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, it was nice knowing you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, goodbye!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you must live on!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne watched excitedly as Alfreda's body gradually became solid. Time suddenly seemed to slow down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Faster! Even faster!" he thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Alfreda's body fully appeared before Osborne. The petite Alfreda looked exactly as adorable as Osborne remembered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, she was completely naked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had not a single thought about sex. He was simply excited, watching Alfreda and waiting for her to open her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Adriana, Isa, and the others held their breath at this moment, as if afraid that breathing might affect Alfreda's revival.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Alfreda's long eyelashes fluttered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she slowly opened her eyes, as if she had been asleep for a long time, lost in a deep dream. Alfreda's eyes looked confused. She simply stretched lazily, fully revealing her delicate figure in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, her gaze suddenly became clear, and she froze in place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Osborne's excited face in front of her, she couldn't help but blink. Finally, she rubbed her eyes in disbelief, then showed a look of utter shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, are you dead too?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Alfreda speak, Osborne's face lit up with a smile. The next second, he saw Alfreda suddenly rush over, throwing herself into his arms and hugging his neck tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's memory remained frozen at the moment of her death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So at this moment, she thought Osborne was dead too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She held Osborne tightly and comforted him, saying, "I never thought that despite my efforts, I still couldn't save you! In the end, you still died! But don't be afraid. It's okay. We're dead, so be it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Being able to reunite down here after death is still a blessing! Don't worry. I'll help you in hell from now on!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Alfreda finished speaking, she kept patting Osborne's back, comforting him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This left Osborne speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But feeling Alfreda's body warmth, Osborne felt very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda came back to life!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It feels so good to have a dead friend come back to life!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Alfreda sensed something was wrong. She let go of Osborne, carefully looking at him. Then she glanced down at her naked body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She frowned and muttered, "Strange, does hell discriminate? Why am I naked after death, but you get to wear clothes?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is unfair!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why do you get to see my body, but I can't see yours? Take off your clothes too, let me see you naked&mdash;that's fair!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Alfreda lunged forward to strip Osborne's clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned and quickly stopped Alfreda, hurriedly saying, "Alfreda, stop! There are others here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you're not dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he spoke, Alfreda was stunned. "I'm not dead? And there are others here? Where are they?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda turned around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, seeing Isa, Clarissa, Adriana, and others, Alfreda was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A piercing scream came from Alfreda's mouth.</span></p></div>
