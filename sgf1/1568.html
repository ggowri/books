        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy said, "Just leave him be for now. Unless he comes to you for help, being too friendly might raise suspicions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno nodded in agreement. "Got it! I'll let him flounder on his own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne and his group entered the massive building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man leading the way, Ingemar Harrison, spoke coldly, "There's a spacious training room in the basement. Once we activate the divine power barrier, nothing that happens inside will be known outside. It's perfect for our battle! Regular folks don't get access here, but I'm from the Harrison family of the Soaring Lion Clan. One word from me, and the guards will open the door!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He held his head high, exuding arrogance, proud of being a genius from one of Wild Flame City's top three Upper Races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though he was only at the peak of the Transcendent Deity level, he believed he was on par with any Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll be the first to challenge you! We don't even need a gauntlet match; I, Ingemar Harrison, can take you down all by myself! I'll show you just how inferior your Human Community is compared to the noble Soaring Lion Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Ingemar strode confidently toward the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>True to his word, after announcing his identity, he easily gained access to the underground training room. Ingemar ushered everyone inside and activated the divine power barrier, sealing them off from the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now you can't back out!" Ingemar sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne surveyed the training room, noting its spaciousness&mdash;it was indeed suitable for a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The high-level divine power barrier ensured they wouldn't be spied upon unless someone outside had abilities like Satan's Eye and could see through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a smile, Osborne murmured to himself, "This place is perfect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now I can unleash my power without holding back and transform them all into my Blood Clan descendants without anyone noticing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ingemar, overhearing him, scoffed. "What are you mumbling about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are we fighting or not?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're too scared, just admit defeat and apologize to each of us. Maybe we'll consider forgiving you!" Ingemar declared, puffing out his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly! You suggested the gauntlet, and now that we're here, you're not backing down, are you? Osborne, a lowly Human Community member like you thinks you can be our commander? Apologize now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want to fight, then let's fight! If not, just apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ingemar, show him a lesson he won't forget!" the crowd shouted in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ingemar's pride swelled even more as he replied coolly, "Bring it on! I can't wait to personally defeat you and crush you underfoot! They say you just broke through to the Celestial Deity level and toyed with Fabian Deity Overlord. Many claim you're impressive, but I don't buy it! I'll take you down easily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, a powerful wave of divine power erupted around Ingemar, his overwhelming energy pressing toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne regarded Ingemar calmly and said, "If you're eager to fight, then let's do this! By the way, the key to the divine power barrier is in your hands, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ingemar paused for a moment, then replied nonchalantly, "Yeah, it's in my hands. Why do you ask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "Just curious. As long as you have it, let's get started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ingemar smirked, "Alright! Prepare to witness the might of an Upper Race prodigy! Don't disappoint me by not being able to take even one of my moves; that would be so boring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that instant, Ingemar sprang into action, darting toward Osborne with blinding speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within seconds, Ingemar was right in front of Osborne, delivering a powerful palm strike aimed at his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get down!" Ingemar shouted sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, however, remained unmoved, his expression as steady as a stone. He simply stood there, feeling the strength of Ingemar's divine power wash over him, and he couldn't help but nod in acknowledgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Truly impressive for a prodigy of the Upper Race! Though you're only at the peak of the Transcendent Deity level, you're already much stronger than the average Celestial Deity at the early stages. But unfortunately for you, that's just not enough to stand against me now. Since you've come here, you might as well stay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he muttered these words, Osborne responded with a strike of his own, effortlessly shattering Ingemar's attack. In a blur, he reached out and seized Ingemar by the throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It all unfolded so seamlessly, as if Ingemar had willingly offered his neck to Osborne's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That powerful strike that had seemed so imposing just moments ago was rendered meaningless in Osborne's presence, barely rustling the hem of his clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The onlookers, originally buzzing with excitement at the prospect of watching Ingemar teach Osborne a lesson, were now left in stunned silence. They blinked in disbelief; one moment, Ingemar had been charging in with confidence, and the next, he was ensnared in Osborne's grip, utterly dominated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shock painted their faces, eyes wide as they processed the scene. They all knew Ingemar's prowess and wondered, "How could he fall like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them finally roared in anger, "Damn it! You lowly Human Community scum!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ingemar is the heir of the Harrison family from the Soaring Lion Clan! I command you to release him at once!"</span></p></div>
