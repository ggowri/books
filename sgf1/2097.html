        <h1>Chapter 2088 Formidable Spores</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery and Hermione were thrown backward, blood spraying from their mouths as they crashed onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the siblings Neville and Arabela turned their maniacal gaze toward Godfrey and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her cold blue eyes locked onto Osborne, Arabela launched a powerful attack, her palm slicing through the air with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda finally sensed something was terribly wrong. But with her attention divided as she fought off a swarm of Ghostwing Insects, she realized there was no time to intervene; Arabela was too close, and the assault was too swift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic washed over her, leaving her pale and helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, amidst the turmoil, Osborne remained disturbingly calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Arabela charged at him, he didn't flinch. Instead, he vanished from view, reappearing behind her in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he grabbed her by the shoulder and delivered a sharp blow to the back of her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabela let out a muffled groan as her body crumpled to the ground, unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfrey, however, wasn't so fortunate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed Neville's impending strike but couldn't evade it entirely. His armor shifted and contorted, forming a protective barrier behind him just in time to absorb most of the force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, the impact sent him flying, blood spilling from his mouth as his complexion turned ghostly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Beverly appeared, her figure slicing through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dance of her dagger, she effortlessly blocked every strike from Neville, forcing him into a defensive position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyrus rushed in to assist Beverly, ready to help subdue Neville.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as it seemed they'd finally cornered him, another shock hit. In the blink of an eye, Cyrus' gaze turned an eerie blue as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beverly, look out!" Osborne shouted, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyrus had already changed targets, unleashing a savage punch aimed straight at Beverly's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sensed his movement but had no time to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a surge of spatial energy enveloped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power whisked Beverly away, transporting her next to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyrus' punch struck the ground, leaving behind a massive crater in the purple-black earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly's heart raced, shock written all over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!" She turned to Osborne, awestruck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once considered him a burden in their team but never imagined he would be the one to save her in this moment of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then her gaze fell on Arabela, who was now unconscious at Osborne's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock surged through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabela was an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, a powerhouse who had nearly devastated Avery just moments ago. And yet, here she lay&mdash;taken down by Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did he manage that?" she wondered inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now's not the time; we need to deal with the crisis at hand!" Osborne urged, pressing on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyrus and Neville were locked in a fierce battle, both unleashing everything they had in a duel that could very well end in death for one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is going on?" Beverly asked, her brow furrowed in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at the towering mushroom trees, his expression shifting to one of gravity. "If I'm right, these mushroom trees are behind this madness! They've released a cloud of spores&mdash;spores that have a potent hallucinogenic effect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those with weak soul power can't resist the hallucinogenic effects of these spores, driving them into a frenzy where they can't tell friend from foe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Neville, Arabela, and Cyrus&mdash;none of them possess strong enough soul power, and they fell victim to the madness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne surveyed the chaos unfolding before him, a heavy weight settling on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their team was faring better than many others, but that was hardly a silver lining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the nine of them, only Neville, Arabela, and Cyrus had succumbed to the hallucinogenic spores from the mushroom trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the situation for the other exploration teams was dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of their members were completely out of control, driven mad by the spores and attacking their own comrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relentless assault of the Ghostwing Insects compounded the chaos, resulting in a steady stream of casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly echoed, her face pale with concern, "Mushroom tree spores?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Potent hallucinogenic effect?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any Supernal Deity King has a powerful soul power. Yet, the spores of these mushroom trees can plunge them into illusions and madness... This hallucinogenic effect is truly formidable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her gaze to Osborne, seeking a solution. "Do you have any ideas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, frustration etched on his features. "I've already tried to bring them back to their senses, but it's impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And as time goes on, we'll be affected too, eventually succumbing to the madness ourselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we don't end up killing each other, we'll be overwhelmed by the Ghostwing Insects!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The best course of action now is to knock them out and get out of this mushroom forest as quickly as possible. Otherwise, we'll all be caught in this nightmare."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced over at Alfreda, who was valiantly fighting off a swarm of Ghostwing Insects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she was powerful, the sheer number of insects was beginning to overwhelm her, and the tension on her face was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their nine-member team was on the brink of collapse, teetering on the edge of disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Neville, Arabela, and Cyrus lost to the madness, and Godfrey, Hermione, and Avery injured, only Alfreda, Beverly, and Osborne remained capable of fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to get out of this mushroom forest immediately!" Osborne insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly nodded, understanding the urgency. "Osborne, you stay safe. I'll try to knock out Neville and Cyrus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at her, surprised. "Are you serious? They're both Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings, just like you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to knock them out could put you in serious danger. If they turn their attention to you, it could end badly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly's expression hardened as she clenched her jaw. "I don't know if I can do it, but it's our only option. We're a team, and we can't just abandon them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, I have to try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination in her eyes, she prepared to leap into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped in front of her, his tone calm but firm. "Hold on. I'm going with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, you?" Beverly looked at him, bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "What? You don't believe in my abilities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She replied, her brow furrowed in concern, "It's not that I don't believe in you. But your cultivation level is too low! You're only Ascension One, while they're Ascension Five! They're in a frenzy, and every move they make is with full force. It's too dangerous for you to be anywhere near them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Is that so? I wouldn't be so sure about that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one said an Ascension One Supernal Deity King can't hold their own against an Ascension Five."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he strode confidently toward Neville and Cyrus.</span></p></div>
