        <h1>Chapter 2323 Terrifying Agatha</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson's face clouded over as he let out a scoff. "Agatha, so you were gonna save me for last? And now you've had a change of heart?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I'm not good enough to be your final adversary?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha offered a faint smile in response to his provocation. "It's not just you. It's all of you&mdash;you, Broderick, and Horace. I originally planned to handle you lot at the end, but now I've got my eyes on a new target."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson's eyes narrowed to slits. "Mind telling me who this 'new target' is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think they're stronger than us, more worthy of being your ultimate opponent? That's a tough pill to swallow. In this state duel, there are only about a dozen contestants who can really go head-to-head with you, and we're three of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who else could make you so wary?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha remained composed. "You'll know who it is after the state duel. For now, let's stop the chitchat and get this over with. I still have to find Broderick and Horace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determination set even more firmly on Benson's face. "Get this over with quickly? You're one cocky lady, Agatha. Just because the Zephyr State officials put you at the top of the strength rankings doesn't mean you're unbeatable. You think you can take me down that easily? Fat chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've fused three types of power, and so have I! You've got your offensive and defensive Sacred Artifacts, and I've got mine! What makes you think you can steamroll me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all from the Resurgent Throne Palace. Even though you're higher-up than me in there, I ain't buying that I'm no match for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson's face was etched with open defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha remained as calm as a still lake. "Not all powers are the same! Even if we've both fused three types of energy, I'm miles ahead of you in terms of raw might. And let's face it, not all Sacred Artifacts are on the same level. So, if you're itching to find out if I can beat you in a flash... well, come at me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'm game!" A fierce fire blazed in Benson's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since fusing his powers, under the Empyrean Sacredness level, Benson was convinced that only a handful could stand up to him, even those who had just reached the Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead-set on proving that Agatha wouldn't have an easy win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Benson fancied his own chances of coming out on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agatha, back at the Resurgent Throne Palace, I never got the chance to take you on. Now, I finally do! Let's see what you're really made of and why the elders there think so highly of you! Let's dance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Benson launched his attack. A massive surge of searing energy exploded from him, like a volcano blowing its top, making the very first layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm tremble under its might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brandished a Sacred Artifact in each hand&mdash;a gigantic sword and a hefty shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung the massive sword, and it was like a conduit for pure, ferocious flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deadly wave of fiery energy formed, crashing towards Agatha like a tempestuous storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Benson let loose with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Agatha's eyes were as calm as the eye of a hurricane. As Benson's terrifying onslaught bore down on her, she didn't so much as flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, twelve small shields materialized out of thin air, swirling around her like a protective whirlwind and encasing her within an unbreakable shell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The infernal energy slammed into the twelve shields, setting off an explosion that shattered and dissipated into nothingness. But far from weakening, the shields seemed to soak up the flames and spin even faster, now glowing with a faint, otherworldly fire of their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson stood there, his jaw on the floor. His all-out strike hadn't just failed to break through Agatha's defenses; it had somehow made them stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha's Phoenix Skeletal Shield could actually absorb his flames!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Benson watched in horror as Agatha slowly drew out a bone flute&mdash;the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson's eyes went wide with terror. He'd heard the stories about the flute's terrifying power. It was said that when Agatha played it, she could unleash a soul-devouring force that even Empyrean Sacredness warriors couldn't hope to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, he'd never seen it in action and had even doubted the tales.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Agatha raised the flute to her lips, a cold chill of dread ran down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Benson whipped out his colossal Sacred Artifact shield, which burst into a blinding glow, erecting a formidable protective barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute sang its song.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shrill, phoenix-like wail rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Benson's Sacred Artifact shield's defense crumbled with a thunderous crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson stood there, rooted to the spot, his mind a complete blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to drag on forever before he finally snapped out of his stupor. He frantically scanned the area around him, but there was no sign of Agatha&mdash;she had vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson then looked down at his badge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart sank as the harsh reality dawned on him&mdash;his points had nose-dived by a whopping ten percent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From over six million points, he'd dropped to under six million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha had snatched those points from him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was in a daze, she'd swiped a tenth of his points and slipped away without him even batting an eyelid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, a cold shiver ran down Benson's spine. He knew that if Agatha had wanted him dead, he'd have been history right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Un-freaking-believable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson was utterly crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd fancied himself a match for Agatha, thinking that even if he lost, he could at least make her sweat or end up in a stalemate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now he saw how stupidly naive he'd been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite fusing three types of power, just like Agatha, and brandishing his own offensive and defensive Sacred Artifacts, the chasm between their strengths was mind-boggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before going up against Agatha, it had never crossed his mind that someone below the Empyrean Sacredness could be so utterly terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Thank God she's up against Broderick and Horace next! Even if I lose, I can still vie for second place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Benson steeled his resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stole another glance at his badge and saw that Agatha's bright white dot was almost on top of Broderick's. He knew their battle was about to kick off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Broderick stood there, waiting for Agatha, his face as grim as a thundercloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd just watched Agatha's dazzling white dot zero in on Benson's, and not long after, she'd set off straight towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, Agatha's score had shot up by over 600 thousand points, soaring to over 9.4 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant Agatha had flattened Benson in the blink of an eye and was now bearing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick knew he couldn't afford to slack off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he caught sight of Agatha approaching in the distance, he took a deep breath and locked eyes with her, his own eyes blazing with steely determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agatha, you're finally here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Skip the chitchat! I know you've taken out Benson, and now it's my turn. But you won't have it so easy with me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A minute later, Agatha brushed off Broderick's stunned look and made a quick getaway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was her next prey? Horace!</span></p></div>
