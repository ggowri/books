        <h1>Chapter 2210 Past-life Memories-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes snapped open abruptly as he fully assimilated all the memories of his past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those recollections, what etched the deepest mark in his soul was neither the epic battles against Lord Malevolence on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet nor the precious time he'd dedicated to nurturing Clarissa and Isa. Instead, it was the hundreds of years he'd shared with his humble mother in the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in his eyes, blurring his vision, and the most excruciating memory came rushing back like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could vividly see his mother desperately beseeching his father, but the man remained deaf-eared, firmly believing that she was the mastermind behind the chaos and ultimately sentencing her to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time that heart-wrenching scene replayed in his mind, it was as if a sharp dagger </span><span>were</span><span> </span><span>stabbing at his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, all Osborne could do was stand there helplessly, watching as his mother met her tragic end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming pain threatened to engulf him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let the tears stream down freely, his eyes fixed blankly on the empty space before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that direction lay the Racial Convergence Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the core of the Racial Convergence Planet was the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the very place where his past-life mother was laid to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom..." Osborne murmured, his voice quivering as fresh tears trickled down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Isa, Clarissa, and the others stood rooted to the spot, completely stunned by the sight of Osborne with tears streaming down his cheeks. They were at a complete loss as to what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why is Osborne crying so bitterly just after integrating his past-life memories?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Isa reached out and tightly clasped Osborne's hand, her grip a clear sign of her anxiety. "Osborne, what's the matter? Did something go awry during the memory integration? I'm so sorry! It's our fault; we shouldn't have let you do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her eyes grew red-rimmed, and tears welled up in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, and Austin watched on, their own eyes glistening. The sight of Osborne in such distress was like a sharp pang in their hearts, and they quickly rushed forward to envelop him in a warm embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling their comforting warmth, Osborne finally snapped out of his daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep, steadying breath and then managed a faint smile. "Don't fret. I'm fine! It's just that some unforeseen memories from my past life caught me off guard for a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those thoughts, he suppressed the guilt and pain that welled up at the thought of his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was fully cognizant that no matter how much he yearned to, the past was immutable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mother had been executed, and more than a thousand years had slipped by since then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While a millennium might hold little significance for true warriors, the individuals who had bullied and humiliated him, those who had plotted against his mother, and those who had taken pleasure in his misery were probably still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, all he could do was tuck those agonizing memories away deep in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke once more, a smile reappearing on his face, "I'm okay now! So, that was my past life. How dull it was&mdash;all I did was train, and there was nothing else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, then shifted his gaze to Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Anita.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the memories now fully integrated, he felt an instant sense of familiarity and a closer bond with them, particularly Anita.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before integrating the memories, Anita had seemed like a senior, "God of Light" to him, but now he motioned for her to come closer.</span></p></div>
