        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and nodded gently. "All the preparations are done. Just wait and see how I perform."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela said in surprise, "It seems you're very confident in yourself. It's a pity I can't be there to cheer you on in person or witness your brilliant performance in the Zone Duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was slightly surprised upon hearing this. "Ms. Olsen, aren't you the one taking me this time?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela shook her head. "I would like to take you, but this time the task has been assigned to Lenny. He will personally escort you. I happen to have some important matters to handle on my end and can't get away for now. Lenny is an Advanced Empyrean Sacredness Warrior, and he can ensure your safety better than I can."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Angela's words, Osborne </span><span>didn't say anything else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment, Angela added, "Also, Ms. Alba told me she would be there to watch in person. If you run into any trouble, you can reach out to her. With her presence, you don't need to worry about any issues."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was startled, "Ms. Alba will really be there to watch in person? Will she bring Isa and the others along?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Ms. Olsen. And thanks to Ms. Alba for trusting me. I promise I won't let you down in the Zone Duel!" Osborne said solemnly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela smiled. "Osborne, confidence is good, but don't get too careless. This Zone Duel is different from before. Recently, many geniuses and experts have emerged everywhere. Eastern Zone 3 has a total of one hundred states. In the State Duels of each state, quite a few talents have appeared."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Some of them are even stronger than Agatha, Horace, and Broderick in my eyes! So, you must not take this lightly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before, when you said you wanted to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, I didn't believe you and thought it was impossible. But now, you've successfully entered the Zone Duel and even became the champion of Zephyr State. With your strength, as long as you stay steady, you absolutely have a chance to stand out in the Zone Duel and qualify for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Therefore, no matter what, you must remain cautious and never underestimate any opponent. Even if you face someone weaker than you, give it your all. Otherwise, if you fail, you won't have another chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela paused for a moment, looking a bit </span><span>hesitant.</span><span>But</span><span> she finally spoke, "Also, Ms. Alba specifically mentioned that the Glorious Divine Kingdom places great importance on this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. After the competition, they might take a series of significant actions. If you can enter the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, it will be a rare opportunity. You must seize it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt the concern in Angela's words and solemnly nodded. "Ms. Olsen, don't worry, I will handle it carefully."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, I am determined to win!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After chatting a bit more, Osborne left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, a day passed. Only five days remained until the opening of the Zone Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the disciples, Elders, and even the Peak Lord of the Mystic Sirius Sect had already received Lenny's notice and gathered at the training field to </span><span>send</span><span> Osborne off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to Osborne's outstanding performance and dominant victory in the Tempest Fortress City duel and the Zephyr State duel, the entire Mystic Sirius Sect gained fame. Recently, </span><span>tons of</span><span> people have been eager to join the Mystic Sirius Sect, making the sect bustling with activity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The nine peaks of the Mystic Sirius Sect also welcomed many highly promising new disciples.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, Peak Seven, where Osborne resided, was the most popular and attracted the most attention.</span></p></div>
