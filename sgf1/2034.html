        <h1>Chapter 2026 Assassinate</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted dramatically at the mention of Icy One. "You mean to tell me that Icy One is coming to assassinate me? That seems a bit excessive, don't you think? He's the leader of the Nine Dark Sovereigns, and I'm just an Ascension One Supernal Deity King. Does he really need to come after me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light chuckled. "Osborne, it seems you still don't grasp just how extraordinary your potential is. If I were your enemy, I would stop at nothing to eliminate you, no matter the cost. I wouldn't give you a moment to grow stronger; otherwise, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rubbed his nose, thinking, "Is it really </span><span>like </span><span>that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, hearing such praise from the God of Light felt gratifying. After a moment's reflection, he realized there was merit to what the God of Light was saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Icy One really is coming to kill me?" he asked, his tone more serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely. If he manages to take out the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community, Icy One could easily turn the tide of the competition. Soon enough, they could leverage the outcome to force the Human Community out of Peaks City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That would put me in a tight spot, having to decide whether to abandon Peaks City. My goal here is to buy us some time... If we lose Peaks City, the Human Community will forfeit a strategic stronghold, and the Dark Deity Legion could launch a full-scale war at any moment. If I refuse to leave, the war will still happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None of that is what I want to see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne lowered his head, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, he finally spoke up, "God of Light, what are you telling me to do? Do you want me to stay in the Sanctum of Light?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light nodded. "Exactly! What I'm saying is that for the next few days, you all need to stay put in the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With my protection, while it may not guarantee absolute safety, it will make it significantly harder for Icy One and his crew to find an opportunity to strike."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, surprised. "So even staying in the Sanctum of Light doesn't mean we're completely safe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light nodded again. "This time, all Nine Dark Sovereigns have arrived at the border battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aside from the deceased Icy Nine, the remaining ones are all much stronger. Icy One, in particular, is on par with me as an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The others, from Icy Two to Icy Six, are all Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they are determined to kill you, hiding in the Sanctum of Light won't guarantee your safety. It all depends on their resolve! However, being in the Sanctum of Light is certainly safer than being out in the open. No matter what, I will do everything in my power to protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, the Paramount Supreme Clan had other Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings and numerous Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings. If these top-tier powerhouses were hell-bent on killing them, even the God of Light would find it tough to shield them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should he do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne was confident in his immortality&mdash;he believed Icy One couldn't completely kill him&mdash;he still felt uneasy about being targeted like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't just sit here passively waiting for them to come after me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I know they're coming for me, why not turn the tables and set a trap for them?" Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light was taken aback by his words. "Set a trap for them? How do you propose we do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began to think quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he replied, "God of Light, I believe Icy One and his crew will anticipate that we're hiding in the Sanctum of Light. If they want to kill us, they'll likely send someone to distract you, preventing you from protecting us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light nodded at Osborne's words. "Indeed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful grin, Osborne asked, "So, how many of them do you think it would take to keep you occupied?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's confidence shone through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While Icy One and I are both Ascension Seven Supernal Deity Kings, defeating him isn't too difficult for me. However, killing him is another story altogether! But to truly bind me down, they'd need at least Icy One and four of the strongest Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, quickly processing this information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if Icy One, Icy Two, Icy Three, Icy Four, and Icy Five team up, they could keep her busy enough to prevent her from protecting us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That leaves Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six is an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King, while Icy Seven and Icy Eight are Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings. That's a tough spot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings wouldn't be a huge issue for me; my absolute forbidden zone can still suppress their cultivation levels down to Ascension Four! Handling two Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings is manageable for me. If I can take out Icy Nine, I can certainly deal with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Icy Six... his cultivation level far exceeds mine, and my absolute forbidden zone won't work on him anymore. If I run into an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King giving it their all, I'd be crushed without a doubt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed deeper as he contemplated his options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless... unless I can boost my own cultivation level! If I could reach Ascension Two, my absolute forbidden zone would be effective against Icy Six, bringing his level down to Ascension Five. That would give me a fighting chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there's no way I can quickly elevate my cultivation level to Ascension Two in such a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy needed for that is astronomical!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I can't break through my cultivation level, I'll have to borrow some strength instead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's absolute control, I can siphon power from the Blood Golem, temporarily boosting my cultivation level! If I can reach Ascension Two, I can activate my absolute forbidden zone, which would still affect Icy Six!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to the God of Light with a grin. "I've figured out how to outsmart them! If they dare to come after me, they'll regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, a chilling and menacing glint flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light looked at him, intrigued. "You're confident?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "I can't say I have absolute certainty&mdash;maybe a 40 to 50 percent chance. But honestly, that's better than just sitting around waiting for them to strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light frowned. "Forty to fifty percent? What's your plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. He couldn't disclose the details of his strategy; trust wasn't firmly established between them yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry! If I lay out the plan, it might jinx it! Just know that I'm committed to trying this, and I'll need </span><span>you to cooperate with me</span><span>, God of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it works, I promise the Paramount Supreme Clan's Eight Dark Sovereigns will be reduced to five&mdash;or even fewer!"</span></p></div>
