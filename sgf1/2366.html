        <h1>Chapter 2293 Set This Duel Right Here-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the sixth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm, only the top twenty on the power rankings could keep their cool. They pulled out their Sacred Artifacts and, with their might, managed to stand firm in the sixth layer, warding off the attacks of that terrifying storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the ones trailing behind, even with the help of Sacred Artifacts, it was an uphill battle to resist the sixth-layer storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there were distinctions among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top fifty seemed to have </span><span>the</span><span> power</span><span> to stay</span><span>. They could tough it out for a good while, at least a few hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top eighty could last for about an hour. And the top hundred could hold on for a bit, at least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those ranked after the hundredth spot were really struggling. Their defenses would crumble in no time. If Rupert didn't step in to protect them in the nick of time, they'd surely get hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave was in this very pickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ranked 108th on the power rankings. He had no desire to be a show-off and didn't want anyone to catch on that he could handle the sixth-layer storm with relative ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he put on an act of being on the verge of giving in and voluntarily let his Sacred Power defense fizzle out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the state duel hadn't kicked off officially yet, so there was no point in showing his hand just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Conrad caught sight of Osborne's predicament, he immediately sneered in disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said casually, "How ridiculous! People ranked after the hundredth spot have the nerve to come to the sixth layer? If I'd known the state duel was gonna be held in the Arctic Maw Chasm, I'd never have asked you to join my team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>After all</span><span>, my team's gonna be scouring the fifth layer, or maybe even the sixth layer, for tokens for a long time. And you, someone ranked after the hundredth, can't even hang around in the fifth layer for long, yet you're here in the sixth? That's a real knee-slapper!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad's jibes made the faces of those ranked after the hundredth turn a bit sour. He wasn't just taking a dig at Osborne; he was dissing all of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they didn't dare to utter a peep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in the Arctic Maw Chasm, the brutal environment laid bare the vast gulf in their strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an open-and-shut case; one could tell at a glance who was packing some heat and who wasn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong could venture deeper into the chasm, while the weak could barely hold their ground in such a harsh setting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paid Conrad no heed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just some cheap talk. It didn't cost him a thing, so he let Conrad run his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Conrad wasn't about to let Osborne off the hook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He jeered, "What's wrong? Lost your voice? Osborne, didn't you say you wanted to have a go at me before? How about we set this duel right here in the sixth layer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have the guts, do you? Haha, if that's the way it is, then apologize, and plead for my forgiveness. Maybe I'll cut you some slack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a look of utter disdain spread across Conrad's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne retorted coolly, "Set the duel in the sixth layer? You sure about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad was taken aback for a second, then let out a sneering laugh. "What's there to be unsure of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "In the sixth layer, your odds of winning are even slimmer. After all, your teammates can't last long here. If we fight right here, they'll be in even more hot water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if we duel here, you won't have any backup."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Conrad burst out laughing. "So what? At least they can hang around in the sixth layer for a bit. But you? As soon as you step foot in the sixth layer, I won't even have to lift a finger. The hellish storm here will finish you off in no time!"</span></p></div>
