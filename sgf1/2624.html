        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nothing?" Romina frowned, then looked at Osborne, her charming smile returning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Mr. Augustine, I sincerely apologize. A thug just broke into Blossom Cage and stole some very important items. We are searching for them. I deeply regret the inconvenience caused to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To express our apologies, all your expenses today will be half price."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Artifact in that guard's hand has powerful detection abilities and can sense Layne's presence. However, Layne has always been inside Drum's Dimensional Microcosm and has never appeared here, so they naturally can't detect him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pretended to suppress his anger and said, "I see. Someone actually dared to steal from Blossom Cage? How bold! Ms. Hubbard, I hope you catch that thug soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for the half-price discount, that's not necessary. I'm feeling a bit unwell today, so I probably won't be making any big purchases."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Romina said, "Thank you for understanding. Next time you come, I'll make sure to arrange the best girl for you and give you the biggest discount."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Romina left the courtyard with her people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne let out a deep sigh of relief. "Thankfully, she left without any mishaps."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He tried hard to recall if he had revealed any flaws, but the result was, of course, none. At least, Osborne didn't notice any.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need to leave Blossom Cage as soon as possible. This place is too eerie and dangerous. With my current strength, I can't fight them," Osborne thought, then prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as he stepped out of the courtyard, Celia stopped him. "Apologies. Blossom Cage is now sealed off as we search for the culprit who stole Blossom Cage's treasure. Until we find them, please remain in the courtyard."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately frowned. "I have to wait until you find them before I can leave? Didn't you just search my courtyard? I have nothing to do with this, so my leaving shouldn't affect anything, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celia gave an apologetic smile but remained resolute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne noticed that people from several nearby courtyards also wanted to leave but were stopped. After hesitating for a long time, they seemed to relent due to Blossom Cage's power and reluctantly returned to their courtyards.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and had no choice but to return.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Blossom Cage needs to find Layne before letting anyone leave? In that case, let Drum make another trip."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instructed Drum to leave his courtyard and find an empty one to dump Layne's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just needed to wait for Romina and the others to find Layne's body. Once they confirmed Layne was dead, the Blossom Cage blockade should be lifted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Osborne was no longer in a hurry because he had already obtained the information he wanted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Frenetic Storm Warband is returning to Inferno Planet, preparing to enter the Phantomagic Realm that will appear in three days."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In other words, I don't need to actively look for Frenetic Storm Warband. In three days, they'll return to Inferno Planet themselves and enter the Phantomagic Realm."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression turned cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From Layne's memories, Osborne not only learned about Frenetic Storm Warband's upcoming actions but also discovered some extremely important information about his parents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than twenty years ago, while exploring a resource-bearing planet, Frenetic Storm Warband encountered a massive attack from the Bug Clan, resulting in heavy losses of their resource extraction equipment, and even a large number of their members were enslaved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, Frenetic Storm Warband acquired another batch of slaves through special channels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this timing perfectly coincides with when Osborne's parents were sold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was almost certain that his parents had been sold to Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Osborne also received good news from Layne's memories.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is, over the past twenty-plus years, Frenetic Storm Warband's operations have gone smoothly. They discovered, explored, and even mined three small resource-bearing planets, reaping good rewards without encountering too many dangerous situations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over these twenty-plus years, Frenetic Storm Warband has experienced almost no casualties.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only a few slaves died from exhaustion while mining resources. But those were just a few.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, the chances of Osborne's parents still being alive have greatly increased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was extremely excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, Layne is the deputy leader of Frenetic Storm Warband, holding a high position and rarely interacting with slaves, so Osborne didn't find his parents in Layne's memories.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "They will definitely be fine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three days later, Phantomagic Realm will appear near Inferno Planet, and by then all the mid-to-high-level members of Frenetic Storm Warband will enter Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just need to capture all of them, and I will definitely find my parents. I might even uncover some evidence of Phantom Commerce Guild controlling the slave trade through them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne couldn't wait any longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, he was still trapped in the Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through Satan's Eye, he saw that Romina had already arrived with her people outside the small courtyard where Drum had discarded Layne's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hope everything goes smoothly." Osborne saw Romina walk straight into the small courtyard, and his eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the small courtyard at this moment, Layne's body lay there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I found it!" Romina visibly breathed a sigh of relief, quickly approached Layne's body, confirmed that Layne was completely dead, and couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Strange, what exactly happened? How did he end up dead here? How did he leave his own courtyard, and how did he get in here? Also, the Bewitching Lantern is not on him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Romina's expression was extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who rescued him? Who killed him and left the body here? And who took the Bewitching Lantern? The Bewitching Lantern is a Legendary Sacred Artifact. If the leader finds out it's lost, I'll be punished too!" Romina murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she had no idea that not far from her, Drum was floating in the air, completely invisible to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum heard Romina's murmurs and quickly relayed them to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bewitching Lantern?" Osborne recalled the lamp that emitted a pink glow, plunging people into the abyss of desire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So it's called Bewitching Lantern. It truly is a Legendary Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smile. This time entering Blossom Cage, not only did he get the information he wanted from Layne, but he also unexpectedly obtained a Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What a great gain!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he must leave Blossom Cage smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, although Romina has discovered Layne's corpse, she clearly has no intention of lifting Blossom Cage's lockdown and instead wants to continue searching for the Bewitching Lantern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is a bit troublesome!" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He naturally couldn't return the Bewitching Lantern, but he also didn't want to be trapped in Blossom Cage forever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since they won't lift the lockdown on their own, I'll have to leave myself," Osborne thought, preparing to call Drum back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Drum could quietly take him through Blossom Cage's defense shield and leave Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, what happened in the courtyard made Osborne stop his actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A look of surprise appeared on his face.</span></p></div>
