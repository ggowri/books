        <h1>Chapter 811 Kill Them All</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't let his guard down because the head he saw flying wasn't actually Mose's.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that split second, another Eityreia Organization assassin had swapped places with Mose, allowing him to narrowly escape the fatal blow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes widened in surprise.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's this? Another spatial power? Swapping places?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose's expression darkened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just moments ago, he had come dangerously close to death. As a top-tier assassin of the Eityreia Organization, being taken out by another assassin-like trick would have been humiliating.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, he had a special divine artifact that allowed him to instantly switch places with someone else, saving him from the attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gritting his teeth, Mose hissed, "Axell, you've really impressed me! It's been a long time since I've faced such a tenacious prey. The more challenging you are, the more exhilarated I become! Only by eliminating prey like you will I feel truly satisfied."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Mose launched into a furious assault.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's Thunder Realm finally collapsed, and Mose's form vanished once more.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you still have your Spatial Domain! Bring it out, too. Once I break your Spatial Domain, let's see what other tricks you've got!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose's voice echoed, but his exact position remained uncertain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne tensed up, thinking, "Mose's stealth techniques are too effective. I can't pinpoint his location, and I could be ambushed at any moment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Should I use Spatial Domain again to lock onto him?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What if I can't kill him this time either?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne snorted, saying, "I don't need Spatial Domain to find you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he activated Satan's Eye.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since arriving in Tethynia, Osborne had kept his identity hidden and hadn't used Satan's Eye, but in the current situation, he had no choice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Satan's Eye activated, the world before Osborne became incredibly clear, and he could finally see Mose's trace, who was hiding a few hundred yards away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose clearly intended to wait until Osborne used his Spatial Domain and then strike from the outside to avoid being attacked.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately for Mose, he had miscalculated.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had used Satan's Eye instead of the Spatial Domain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mose saw the activation of Satan's Eye, his eyes widened in shock. "Is that Satan's Eye? You're not the Lambert family's Axell! You're from Rosmandi's Augustine family!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're Osborne!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No wonder your face seemed familiar before. I thought it was just a disguise. So this is your true identity!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, how dare you come to Tethynia as an Augustine family member! Aren't you afraid of the Aberrants taking you down?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose's eyes glinted with cold fury.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne snorted, saying, "Why should I be afraid? Not only did I come, but I'm also going to kill you and walk away unscathed!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne made his move.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Prison!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The space around them was frozen, making the use of Spatial Prison drain more of Osborne's mental strength. But the pressure Mose had put on him was too great; Osborne couldn't afford to hesitate.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instantly, a prison of space formed, trapping Mose inside.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose's face went pale as he rapidly slashed with his black dagger, trying to break through the Spatial Prison. But before he could make any headway, Osborne was already in front of him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a swift motion, Osborne brought down the Goddess of Grain's scythe with lethal force toward Mose.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose quickly raised his black dagger to defend against the attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sharp clang of metal echoed through the air as Mose's pitch-black dagger was sliced cleanly in half by the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The scythe continued its deadly arc, slicing through Mose's defenses and severing his throat in a brutal, decisive blow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Mose's body went rigid.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes, wide with shock, stared at the broken remains of his divine artifact dagger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Utter disbelief etched his face. He glanced at Osborne, his eyes flickering with a mix of defiance and anger, but ultimately, those emotions faded into a cold, lifeless stare.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next moment, his head tumbled from his neck, blood spraying wildly in all directions.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne let out a relieved breath.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The top assassin of the Eityreia Organization, ranked 205th on the Godson Rankings, was finally dead.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's gaze shifted to the four severely injured members of the Williamson family, who had been battered by the Volt Hammer.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fear was evident in their eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four men cried out in terror, "You're not Axell! You're Osborne from the Augustine family! Damn you, you're finished! We've already sent word back to the Williamson family. You're done for, Osborne!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered, saying, "Whether I'm finished or not is still up in the air. But one thing's for sure. You're done. Time to meet your end."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without another word, Osborne moved swiftly, decapitating each of them with ruthless efficiency.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The area fell eerily silent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four Williamson family members and the six Eityreia Organization assassins were all dead.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air was thick with blood energy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absorb it!" Osborne commanded.</p></div>
