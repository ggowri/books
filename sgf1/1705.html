        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days later, Angelo, Chandler, Arnold, and Mariah stood before Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler said, his voice filled with reverence, "My Lord, we've successfully transformed 400 thousand individuals. Everything has gone smoothly. There are still about 20 thousand out on various assignments, but they'll gradually return to the base </span><span>over the next few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've already made arrangements, and once they arrive, we'll make sure they're transformed without any hiccups."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, clearly pleased. "Excellent! Moving forward, keep things running as they were. We can't afford any slip-ups that might raise suspicions. Just avoid any overreaching tasks; preserve your strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne retrieved a Dimensional Bag from his side and handed it to Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Chandler opened it, his jaw dropped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued calmly, "Inside, you'll find over 400 thousand Celestial Crystals, as well as one million Ultimate Essence Crystals. These are your resources for cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Distribute the Celestial and Essence Crystals without delay. Ensure every single person within our base receives at least one Celestial Crystal for training. Push them to break through their limits and reach new heights. My ambition is for each and every one of them to ascend to the rank of Deity Overlord</span><span>, </span><span>or even reach the pinnacle of the Deity Overlord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the weight of his words sunk in, Chandler and the others gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestial Crystals were incredibly precious. Even prodigies from the Paramount Supreme Clan had trouble acquiring them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One Celestial Crystal contained enough energy to match 100 million low-grade Essence Crystals, and its purity was unmatched</span><span>, </span><span>it had the potential to elevate one's capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For those who weren't lacking in talent, just one Celestial Crystal should be enough to propel them into the Deity Overlord realm or even push them to the peak of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had provided these Celestial Crystals to turn the entire 420 thousand inhabitants of Divine Peak Nine into Deity Overlord warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his plan succeeded, a legion of 420 thousand Deity Overlords would be an unprecedented force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's thoughts drifted further</span><span>. I</span><span>magine the entire Ninth Dark Deity Legion of over two million soldiers transformed into Deity Overlords!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over five million Celestial Crystals at his disposal, sacrificing two million wouldn't bother him too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler exchanged astonished glances with the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he spoke, a mix of gratitude and concern in his tone, "Thank you for your generosity, my Lord! With these Celestial Crystals, each of us will likely break into the mid-stage Deity King phase. Everyone else in the base should advance quickly to Deity Overlords as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this rapid rise in strength will surely attract attention. We won't be able to hide it or provide a reasonable explanation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler frowned tightly, an anxious crease forming on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since their transformation into the Blood Clan, their thoughts had centered solely on serving Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were grateful for the opportunity to enhance their power, but the fear of </span><span>discovery loomed large.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled</span><span> and </span><span>alla</span><span>yed</span><span> their worries, "Don't fret. I have a solution!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll teach you the Eclipsing Mantra!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eclipsing Mantra had the ability to mask one's energy, even altering the state of Divine Flame. If he imparted this technique to the others, they would be able to conceal their true power level. No matter how fast their realms increased, they wouldn't be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the near future, everyone at the base could appear to be at the Transcendent Deity or Celestial Deity level while secretly being mid-stage Deity Overlords!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Paramount Supreme Clan launched a full-scale war against the Human Community in the West Zone, they would wield tremendous power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, mastering the Eclipsing Mantra would be a challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mastering the Eclipsing Mantra required not only aptitude but also a keen intellect. Without sufficient talent or insight, even grasping the basics would be a challenge. To truly conceal one's realm, one would need to elevate their understanding of the mantra to at least Level Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne had a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had discovered that through the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he could impart his insights on the Eclipsing Mantra directly to all his Blood Clan descendants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having already reached Level Four of the mantra himself, Osborne was well-equipped to share his understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, they wouldn't need to struggle through the process of comprehension; they could seamlessly grasp the essential techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they might never achieve the mastery he possessed, learning the first two levels would not be an issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, every inhabitant of the base could use the Eclipsing Mantra to effectively obscure their true power levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I will teach you the Eclipsing Mantra!" Osborne declared without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the Eclipsing Mantra had been taught to him by Mila and was a closely guarded secret of her family, with explicit warnings from Divine Shadow not to share it with outsiders, he didn't consider his Blood Clan descendants outsiders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their unwavering loyalty to him made them family. Teaching them the mantra posed no risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipsing Mantra!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne activated the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he began to channel his understanding of the mantra into Angelo, Chandler, and the others. They immediately settled into meditative positions, prepared to absorb this new knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same moment, the same scene unfolded across the base, with every individual engaged in a parallel process of enlightenment.</span></p></div>
