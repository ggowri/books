        <h1>Chapter 2327 Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His excitement cranked up a notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His golden skin glowed even brighter as he unleashed another wave of bone-crushing punches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time around, it only took five well-placed punches for Lincoln to completely annihilate Osborne's Sacred Power arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?" Osborne blurted out, his voice tinged with a touch of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, watch your back! Lincoln hails from the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan! The longer they fight, the stronger they get&mdash;there's practically no ceiling to their power! If you wanna take him down, you gotta act fast. Otherwise, he'll just keep climbing the power ladder, and no one'll be able to put the brakes on him!" Clara yelled, her voice thick with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's warning triggered a flood of memories in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his past life, he'd been a prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, poring over tales about its founding ancestor, Solomon. Naturally, he was well-acquainted with Solomon's buddy, the Invincible Battle Overlord, Armand, and the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those were old memories, and it took Clara's words to bring them into sharp focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, so it's the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up as he finally understood why Lincoln's energy signature had been skyrocketing. He was clearly slipping into the Battle Warrior's Rampage State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this state, if Osborne didn't act swiftly, he'd be the one in hot water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Battle Warrior's Rampage State knew no bounds. Even a heavy-hitter from the Empyrean Sacredness level could find themselves in a pickle if they didn't make a move quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If the stars aligned, I'd love to see just how far that infinite growth can go! But tough luck, this is a state duel. I can't afford to give you a free pass or waste any more time on you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne pulled back his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So this next arrow's gonna pack an even bigger punch. You won't know what hit you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln, all fired up with battle lust, felt the energy coursing through his golden-hued skin, which was glowing like a furnace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed at Osborne's words. "Come on then! Every time a member of the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan gets knocked on their ass, they bounce back even stronger! So I'm itching for you to take me down! But if you think you can stop my ascent, you've got another think coming. Don't let me down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "Let's see what you're made of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he let loose a dazzling blast of Sacred Power from the arrow nocked on his Bloodwrought Bow. A terrifying wave of energy radiated out from it, as if the very fabric of space was collapsing. Lightning crackled all around, and darkness seemed to ignite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln's expression hardened. "A Sacred Power that combines three forces? You've fused powers just like Agatha and Horace, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, wearing a calm smile. "Just got it fused recently! And you're gonna be the first one to feel my new Sacred Power arrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln's eyes lit up with excitement. "Bring it on! I'm itching to see how powerful a Sacred Power arrow with three-force infusion can be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said that, his golden aura flared up, shining even brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Sacred Power arrow zoomed towards Lincoln at breakneck speed. Any run-of-the-mill warrior wouldn't have had a chance to react, but Lincoln was no ordinary fighter. The moment Osborne released the bowstring, he sprang into action. His fists moved so fast that they were just a blur, leaving a trail of afterimages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he started unleashing a flurry of punches at the Sacred Power arrow, landing over a dozen blows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted from his fists with each strike, but he kept going, getting faster and stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few moments, he'd thrown over twenty punches, feeling like he'd reached his limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all his dog-gone, non-stop effort was for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln's fists were now a bloody mess, with the bone showing through the torn flesh. Yet, the Sacred Power arrow only dimmed a little bit and showed no sign of breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying Sacred Power arrow crashed head-on into the golden aura that surrounded Lincoln.</span></p></div>
