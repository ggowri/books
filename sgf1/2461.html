        <h1>Chapter 2368 Exhausting All Efforts-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation instantly made Osborne very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ultimately, you still need me to save you." At this moment, Primordial, transformed into a little </span><span>treant</span><span>, flew in front of Osborne and said, "I was the one who brought out the Warfare Ancient Tree. If not for the Warfare Ancient Tree, the fusion of those three with the Elven Mother Tree would have already been disrupted. So, you should thank me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately looked at Primordial with gratitude. This time, Primordial had indeed helped him a lot by actually bringing out the Warfare Ancient Tree to fight for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This shouldn't have any impact on the Warfare Ancient Tree, right?" Osborne asked with some concern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smiled and said, "Of course, it has an impact. Now, the Warfare Ancient Tree has merged with you, and all its energy comes from you. But since it hasn't been long since the fusion, the power it's consuming now is all from its previous reserves. Once this power is used up, it won't replenish."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This will weaken the Warfare Ancient Tree. So, unless it's absolutely critical, we can't let the Warfare Ancient Tree come out to fight. Unless you become stronger and can provide more power to the Warfare Ancient Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief, thinking, "The Warfare Ancient Tree only consumed some power this time. In the future, I need to work harder to help it replenish quickly. As long as the foundation of the Warfare Ancient Tree isn't affected, it's fine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Isidore was frantically attacking the Warfare Mist. Dozens of Elf Race warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level appeared, coordinating with Isidore in a relentless assault.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could clearly feel the power of the Warfare Ancient Tree depleting rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne felt a bit worried again, thinking, "If even the Warfare Ancient Tree can't withstand their attacks, and the Warfare Mist gets broken, then we're really in trouble. You all must hurry up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood, Osborne could only hope they would quickly complete their fusion with the Elven Mother Tree. Otherwise, they would all die here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the relentless attacks of Isidore and dozens of warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level, the Warfare Mist of the Warfare Ancient Tree finally couldn't hold on. It was gradually breaking and about to collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and activated the Ascending Sacred Sanctum again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the defensive shield of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum was restored. Working together with the Warfare Ancient Tree, it finally managed to withstand the attacks of Isidore and the other warriors once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this rate, they would not be able to hold out for long.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne's Sacred Crystal was running low.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the city duel, he won 1.3 million Sacred Crystals from the casino. Over this period, he had already consumed hundreds of thousands to power the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne discovered that there were only over 400,000 Sacred Crystals left in the internal space of Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And each attack from Isidore and the other warriors forced the Ascending Sacred Sanctum to burn at least 50,000 Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After withstanding at most eight more attacks, Osborne's Sacred Crystals would be depleted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, without the support of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, the Warfare Ancient Tree would be unable to withstand the attacks of Isidore and so many other warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level on its own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave. He had done his best, but it seemed he still couldn't manage it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "No matter what, my cultivation level and strength are too low. If I were at the Empyrean Sacredness level now, with the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and Warfare Ancient Tree, even if I still couldn't defeat Isidore, a warrior at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, I could hold out for a long time. My strength is too weak."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne craved power immensely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, the entire Elf City shook violently, and the energy between heaven and earth instantly became incredibly chaotic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive Elven Mother Tree was violently shaking its branches. Then, a bright green energy shot out instantly, targeting Isidore.</span></p></div>
