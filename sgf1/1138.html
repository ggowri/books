        <h1>Chapter 1137 The Whole World Has Changed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than three months ago, Anastasia's mysterious illness had been cured, but rather than waking up, she had suddenly become a vessel of immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who approached her, aside from Osborne, found themselves under attack from this force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Osborne sought Isa's help, only to discover that nestled within Anastasia's mind was a special organ that ordinary humans didn't possess&mdash;the Crystal of Life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Isa, the presence of the Crystal of Life in </span><span>someone's mind was unique to the people of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anastasia's sister, Zoe, didn't have a Crystal of Life in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This led Osborne to a troubling conclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Zoe's parents must have come from different worlds&mdash;one from Blue Planet and the other likely from </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "It's probably best not to tell them right now. I don't want them to worry. They're still young; I'll explain everything when the time is right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ultimately decided to keep this information to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head and said, "I don't know the details, but when I get the chance, I'll help you both figure it out! For now, let's go see the big tiger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two girls nodded eagerly, not probing further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no memories of their parents and didn't know where to search for them. In their hearts, Osborne was their only family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go see the big tiger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia clung tightly to Osborne's arm, while Zoe, a bit shy, eventually wrapped her arms around his other arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's go," </span><span>Osborne said with a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a step forward, and together, they stepped into a dimensional rift, traveling through the space away from the Augustine Estate and soaring above the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they gazed down at the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains, Osborne couldn't help but gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been asleep for three months, and during that time, the flora in the mountains had exploded in growth. Looking down, all he could see were towering, lush trees stretching as far as the eye could see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each tree was likely over one hundred yards tall, with some reaching two hundred or even three hundred yards&mdash;more primal than any jungle he had ever seen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a dense forest, an ordinary person would struggle to survive; it was so thick that one could hardly see the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't just the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains that had transformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne ascended higher, he looked down again and saw that the entire Blue Planet had become a vibrant green sphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from the cities, towering trees and dense vegetation blanketed the landscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roads connecting cities were completely obscured by plants; highways and railways had been overrun and buried beneath the rampant growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With things like this, I can't imagine how ordinary folks are getting out of the cities," he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded in agreement. "Osborne, for regular people, leaving the city is really dangerous now! The transportation between cities is wrecked, so they can only rely on planes to move supplies and people. And even flying isn't safe because giant flying Ferocious Beasts sometimes attack aircraft!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, there's a global food shortage! Farming outside the cities is nearly impossible now. Thankfully, crop yields have skyrocketed, and if people can set aside some areas within the city for planting, they can barely manage to feed ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell silent again, absorbing the weight of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Osborne shook his head, his voice tinged with a hint of melancholy. "It feels like the world changed overnight, and I barely recognize it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, let's go see those tigers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if we get the chance, we can scatter the Beast Tide to prevent them from organizing an attack on Newport City, which could result in massive casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also want to </span><span>test my current strength along the way..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne led Anastasia and Zoe through the skies above the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a piercing whoosh echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A colossal bird, its size akin to that of a small bull, hurtled towards the trio at an astounding speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its sharp talons glinted menacingly, and its eyes burned with savage intent. Clearly, it saw the three as prey ready to be hunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked in readiness to strike, but Anastasia was quicker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mere flick of her finger, a bolt of lightning zapped through the air. The massive avian beast exploded instantly, vaporizing without leaving a trace of blood or flesh behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia turned to Osborne, her eyes glinting with self-satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Osborne, what do you think of my strength now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Anastasia in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That bird-type beast hadn't posed much threat to him; it was only as powerful as a Class B metahuman. From Anastasia's top-tier Class S perspective, slaying it should have seemed trivial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, something felt different to Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's controlled lightning had an incredibly high energy density!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder Power was one of Osborne's primary disciplines. His Thunder Realm had reached Level Three, and his mastery over lightning was formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he sensed that Anastasia's lightning strike was far more potent and powerful than his own.</span></p></div>
