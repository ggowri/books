        <h1>Chapter 2256 Yapping Cur-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tyson! What do you think you're doing?!" Jamar </span><span>shouted,</span><span> his voice laced with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone would be furious when faced with such an aggressive presence, especially one that seemed intent on provoking them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! </span><span>What does</span><span> look like?" Tyson laughed, a booming sound that filled the air. "I'm just here to say hello and see if your Mystic Sirius Sect disciples have improved over the years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't back down from Jamar's shout; if anything, he intensified his aura, a tidal wave of pressure crashing down on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar, Bethan, and the others felt their faces pale as they struggled to hold their ground, channeling their own power just to remain upright. Anger and frustration were etched on their features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson sneered and said, "Looks like you haven't made any progress at all! You're all a bunch of trash. If you run into me on the city </span><span>duel</span><span> stage, just surrender right away! Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless. My real opponents are Leroy and Marreese from Azure Haven Academy. I don't want to waste my energy on you worthless losers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it?" he added, his expression dripping with arrogance, eyes locking onto Jamar and Bethan as if they were nothing more than insects beneath his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tyson, you're out of line!" Jamar shot back, his anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson scoffed. "Out of line? Maybe it's not me who's arrogant, but you lot who are just pathetic! If you've got a problem with that, why don't you try and do something about it right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze turned icy, and Jamar and Bethan felt a chill run down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The humiliation was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a challenge; it was an outright insult to the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the weight of Tyson's terrifying energy left them speechless. They knew that if they met him on the </span><span>duel</span><span> stage, they'd stand no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration bubbled within them, but they felt utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, there was a straightforward principle&mdash;the strong ruled. The powerful could look down on and mock the weak, and if one wanted to fight back, they had to have the strength to match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they exchanged looks, their eyes all turned to Osborne, filled with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was the champion of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wore the sect's champion medal on his chest with pride, a clear marker of his lofty status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was hoping he'd step forward to take on Tyson and redeem their honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying a word, he simply waved his hand nonchalantly. In an instant, Tyson's overbearing energy dissipated, and then he started walking back to his quarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said in a laid-back tone, "Let's go! No point wasting our time on a yapping cur."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't have cared less about Tyson's deliberate provocation. It was like walking down the street and getting barked at by a rabid dog. No one in their right mind would fight a rabid dog, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any grudges could wait until the official start of the city duel. They'd sort things out in the ring then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's nonchalance in the face of Tyson's blatant provocation came as a breath of fresh air to Jamar and Bethan, instantly boosting their morale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Tyson's expression soured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his steely gaze on Osborne, his features hardening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This guy has actually managed to shatter my oppressive pressure? Impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Tyson's eyes landed on the champion medal on Osborne's chest, and a glimmer of interest flashed in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, so you're the big dark horse from the Mystic Sirius Sect&mdash;Osborne! Not bad, not bad! You're not caving in under my pressure. You've got some chops! I checked your file, and it says you're just an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King. I could hardly believe it at first! How did someone like you manage to become the champion of the Mystic Sirius Sect? Are there no decent folks left in that sect?</span></p></div>
