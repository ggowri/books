        <h1>Chapter 2298 Changes on the Leaderboard-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After tucking away the token from the sixth layer, Osborne took a peek at the info on his badge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His score was still lingering at 300 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His standing on the leaderboard had taken a nosedive. An hour ago, he was sitting pretty in first place, but now he'd slipped down to third.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace was currently leading the score rankings, having amassed a staggering 500 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right behind him was Agatha, with 400 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, with his 300 thousand points, found himself in third place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson was in fourth, having earned 200 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Further down the list, Conrad was in sixth position with 130 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave occupied the nineteenth spot, having scored 654 hundred points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mumbled to himself, "Third place, eh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Horace guy is a real hotshot. He managed to snag five tokens on the sixth layer in no time flat! And Agatha's not far behind, with four tokens to her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that's just the ones they've registered! Maybe they're playing the same game as me, finding tokens but holding off on registering them, keeping a low-key profile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then again, that's probably wishful thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, they're already in the top four on the strength rankings. They're the center of everyone's attention anyway. There's no point in them following my lead and flying under the radar. So, chances are they're registering those tokens as soon as they lay their hands on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even so, they're still pretty darn impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without my Satan's Eye, I'd be up shit creek trying to find these tokens. The conditions on the sixth layer are just a total bitch. You </span><span>gotta</span><span> fend off the effects of that harsh environment while scouring a crazy-complex terrain for those well-hidden tokens. It's a real uphill battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even with my Satan's Eye, I've only managed to bag ten tokens! And they've found five and four respectively. Do they have some kind of super-vision enhancement? Or maybe they've got some ability to boost their senses so they can sniff out those tokens from a mile away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd already discovered ten tokens. If he registered them all, his score would skyrocket to one million. Based on past experience in the state duel, one million points was more than enough to secure a spot in the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne wasn't in such a mad dash to find more tokens anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he'd only registered three tokens and stashed the other seven away was to keep a low profile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, if he was sitting at the top of the leaderboard with twice the score of the second-place contestant, he'd definitely become the hot topic of the whole shebang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Horace and Agatha, who were also out there hunting for tokens on the sixth layer, might start eyeing him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alright! Enough of overthinking. It's time to get back in the game and hunt for those tokens!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I </span><span>gotta</span><span> find as many tokens as I can in these three days and rack up as many points as possible. After all, I don't just want to make it into the top ten myself. I'm even aiming for the championship. And I also want to drag Clara into the top-ten club!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne resumed his search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye swept across the intricate environment, seeing every little nook and cranny as clear as day. Before long, he spotted another token tucked away in a hidden corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eleventh one, bingo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the twelfth, the thirteenth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just kept on finding more and more tokens, but he didn't bother registering them. So, his score stayed put at 300 thousand. As more and more people zoomed past him on the leaderboard, his ranking gradually slipped.</span></p></div>
