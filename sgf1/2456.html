        <h1>Chapter 2364 Trapped</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the King of Nature Elf and a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness, Uriah quickly calmed down and communicated with Osborne swiftly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Are you Alfreda's friend Osborne? Are you the Osborne Isidore is looking for?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah was utterly shocked and anxiously said, "How did you get in? Since you can communicate with me using soul power, you must be close to me, right? Have you returned to Elf City?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you crazy? Isidore is searching everywhere for you. How dare you come to Elf City? If he finds you, you won't be able to escape."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Your Majesty..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you don't need to call me that. Although Alfreda is gone, you are Alfreda's friend. Just call me Mr. Rivera." A trace of sadness flashed in Uriah's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sensing Uriah's sadness, Osborne said, "Mr. Rivera, you don't need to be too sad. Actually, Alfreda is not dead yet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Uriah was utterly shocked. "Osborne, what did you just say? Alfreda isn't dead? How is that possible? Isidore personally told me he killed Alfreda. How could Alfreda still be alive? Isidore may be a bastard, but he wouldn't lie to me about this. So, you don't need to comfort me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt helpless but didn't want to reveal his fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and the ability to resurrect Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only say, "Isidore wasn't wrong. Alfreda was indeed killed by him. But due to some special reason, Alfreda hasn't completely died. She can come back to life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have no reason to lie to you. After all, it would be too easy to expose. In short, you have to trust me. Alfreda isn't dead, and I'm here to get you out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his body was trembling violently, his eyes filled with disbelief, yet he felt that Osborne was telling the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Alfreda isn't dead. My daughter is still alive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears welled up in Uriah's eyes. He hurriedly asked, "Osborne, can I really trust you? Is Alfreda truly not dead?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne explained, "Mr. Rivera, please believe me. Alfreda blocked Isidore's attack to save me, which is why she was almost killed by Isidore. I could never joke about this with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. I believe you." Uriah was incredibly emotional. Compared to Isidore, he was more willing to trust Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued, "It won't be long before I can completely heal Alfreda. Then, your family can reunite. For now, I need to get you out of here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah nodded excitedly. But soon, his expression turned gloomy again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Knowing Alfreda is alive already makes me very happy. But you can't save us. This is the Ethereal Elven Temple. Besides Isidore, there are at least a dozen warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level here. Moreover, the major Royal Families of Elf City have all been controlled by Isidore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this situation, you can't save us. Osborne, don't take the risk. You need to live well and stop worrying about us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne firmly said, "No. The reason you are imprisoned here, the reason Isidore is targeting you, is all because of me. If I can't save you and let Isidore kill you, how can I face Alfreda in the future? How can I explain this to Alfreda?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I must take you away from here. Moreover, I&rsquo;ve already figured out a way, I just need your cooperation. I don&rsquo;t need to enter the Ethereal Elven Temple. I&rsquo;ll use a special method to transfer you directly out of here. But you must not resist. Otherwise, my method will fail."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah was shocked. "You have a special method to transfer us directly out of the Ethereal Elven Temple?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "That's right."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah's expression changed drastically. Finally, he gritted his teeth and said, "Alright. We will cooperate with you. No matter what happens later, we won't resist."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright." Osborne was very happy because he finally communicated well with Uriah.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, he only needed to use Satan's Eye's ocular energy to lock onto the three of them, then transfer them into Satan's Eye's internal space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they quickly left Elf City before Isidore could react.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and said, "Mr. Rivera, you need to be ready. I'm about to take action."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright," Uriah responded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne pushed Satan's Eye to its limit. The Sacredness Level Satan's Eye shimmered with a mysterious and brilliant light. That light transcended time and space, pierced through obstacles, and instantly enveloped Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the three of them were utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They felt a pull. The pull wasn't particularly strong. If they wanted, they could easily resist it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, none of the three resisted the force, because they knew Osborne was saving them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without resistance, their bodies gradually became transparent. The next second, they vanished from the prison, transferred by Osborne's ocular energy into the inner space of Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I did it," Osborne exclaimed with immense joy. Satan's Eye's ocular energy could indeed transfer living beings, provided they didn't resist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must leave Elf City immediately," Osborne thought. He checked on Uriah and the other two inside Satan's Eye's inner space. Seeing they were fine, he immediately headed out of Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as they could leave Elf City, they would be safe. By then, even if Isidore was at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, he wouldn't be able to catch them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before Osborne could leave the training ground, the entire Elf City suddenly shook violently. Then, a jade-green light screen enveloped the entire Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a terrifying aura engulfed the entire Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who is it?" Isidore's furious voice echoed throughout Elf City. "Who rescued my prisoner? All Elf Race members, search carefully. No matter what, you must find them. Whoever you are, since you dared to rescue someone from my prison, you're doomed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Isidore's murderous voice faded, the entire Elf City descended into chaos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Countless Elf Race warriors rushed out, searching everywhere and capturing suspicious individuals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became very serious. "He found out so quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clenching his teeth tightly, he prepared to use spatial power to forcibly tear open a space rift and escape Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he found that he couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive emerald-green defensive shield surrounding the outskirts of Elf City completely enveloped it. Even with spatial power, Osborne couldn't leave at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He angrily said, "Shit! I'm trapped."</span></p></div>
