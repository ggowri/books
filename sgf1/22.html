        <h1>Chapter 22 A Bet</h1>
        <div><p>Osborne chuckled, having already figured out who Wesley was.</p><p>He knew that Ophelia had divorced him because of Wesley.</p><p>To say he had no resentment towards Wesley would be a lie. He then scrutinized Wesley while comparing himself to the other man.</p><p>Wesley was indeed very handsome and tall. As the heir to a top-tier family, his face was full of arrogance, and his designer clothes highlighted his noble status. Compared to him, Osborne’s demeanor did appear much more ordinary.</p><p>“What’s the matter? Cat got your tongue, loser?” Wesley taunted. “Now that I’ve exposed your identity and your lies, you must hate me, right? Why don’t you try to argue back?”</p><p>Osborne chuckled, “There’s no need. I’ve already said before that I’m not some big shot. It’s just that no one believed me. Since you’ve explained it, I feel relieved.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the surroundings erupted in an uproar.</p><p>“He actually admitted it. We almost got fooled by him!”</p><p>“No wonder none of us knew him. We thought he was some hidden big shot, but he’s just a lucky low-class commoner.”</p><p>“Thank goodness Mr. Ashford pointed it out, or we would have been embarrassed.”</p><p>“I even gave him a half-price VIP card.”</p><p>“So did I!”</p><p>“No way. We need to get our business cards and VIP cards back. Our business cards and VIP cards are not something a commoner can have.”</p><p>“Get them back!”</p><p>The faces of the prominent figures darkened, and they all gave Osborne a cold snort. They then ordered their subordinates to retrieve the business cards, VIP cards, and even hotel room keys they had given him.</p><p>Osborne, who had been the center of attention, was now the target of contempt. The business cards, VIP cards, and hotel room keys he had received were soon all taken away.</p><p>The area around him became empty as those who had surrounded him before now kept their distance.</p><p>Wesley watched with a mocking expression, his handsome face full of disdain and ridicule. Yet, Osborne didn’t seem angry at all, which annoyed Wesley.</p><p>Wesley taunted, “Loser, aren’t you upset that I ruined your big moment? Do you want to fight me?”</p><p>With that, he suddenly reached out and wrapped his arm around Ophelia’s waist. Her body stiffened, but she didn’t pull away.</p><p>Osborne knew Wesley was deliberately provoking him, so he naturally didn’t take the bait.</p><p>then said, “You’re the esteemed heir of the Ashford family, and all you do is run your mouth? If you’re game, I’m up for a little fun.</p><p>“Let’s have a one-on-one fight to determine the winner and our fates.</p><p>“Got the guts?”</p><p>With that, Osborne looked at Wesley disdainfully.</p><p>Wesley’s expression froze at the challenge. As an heir to a prestigious family, he couldn’t stoop to a duel with Osborne, let alone one to the death. It was because his life was far more valuable than Osborne’s.</p><p>But Wesley couldn’t ignore the provocation. So, he sneered and replied, “A loser is just a loser, only knowing how to fight. The auction doesn’t allow fighting. So, if you have the guts, let’s compete with our wealth.</p><p>“Let’s see who can spend more money at the auction. The loser will have to submit to the winner. Are you up for it?”</p><p>Wesley stared at Osborne with a challenging look. He knew Osborne couldn’t possibly agree to the bet. How could a commoner dare to compete with a noble heir in spending money? Wesley just wanted to humiliate Osborne.</p><p>But to Wesley’s surprise, Osborne nodded and calmly said, “Alright, I accept.”</p></div>
