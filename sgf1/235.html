        <h1>Chapter 235 The Radcliffe Family's Decision</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sprawling Radcliffe Estate lay at the foot of the mountain, exuding an air of grandeur and antiquity. As one of the seven ancient families of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, the Radcliffe family had a legacy that spanned nearly a millennium, all beginning from this very estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, it had been just a modest cottage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the Radcliffe family grew in power, the estate underwent continuous expansion, eventually evolving into a vast complex covering several million square feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the central area of the Radcliffe Estate, five individuals sat on solid wooden chairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four of them were elderly men, their hair white but their spirits remarkably vibrant, their gazes sharp and penetrating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fifth, a middle-aged man in his forties, possessed a strikingly handsome face and an intense demeanor. He was Dylan Radcliffe, the current head of the Radcliffe family and Clarissa's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other four elders were members of the Wise Order, the governing council of the Radcliffe family. Among them was Eugen Radcliffe, Dylan's father and the family's elder statesman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also Clarissa's grandfather and Donna's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This group represented the core of the Radcliffe family's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, this is the situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan finished his report, lowering his gaze. Despite being the head of the family, he knew that significant decisions ultimately rested with the Wise Order, which held the authority to dismiss him if necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a common structure among the influential families of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, where the Wise Order played a critical role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen furrowed his brow deeply. "Are you certain Orion is dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, it's highly likely. If the Lark family had the strength to find him, they would have done so by now. I heard from Donna that Orion was armed with a level two ancient magic weapon when he went to propose to Clarissa but was rejected. He rushed here afterward, only to vanish without a trace on the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, rumors are swirling that he fell victim to Clarissa's fate power. Those who approached the Radcliffe Estate recently to propose are now living in fear, terrified that they too might suffer the same fate. No one dares to make a proposal anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen's expression darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense! Yes, Clarissa's fate power is formidable, but it requires a union&mdash;a marriage&mdash;for its true potential to be unleashed. Orion merely sought to marry her; he didn't do anything to provoke her power. If that were the case, Apollo would have been the first to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is utter nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen's anger was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan hesitated before saying, "The key point is that Apollo is dead too! People are starting to believe that his death was also a result of Clarissa's fate power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen was momentarily taken aback, rendered speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo and Orion were both dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both had sought to marry Clarissa. Given their status, backgrounds, and strength, who could have possibly killed them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as a result, they all died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Radcliffe family went out to clarify that their deaths had nothing to do with Clarissa, who would believe it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would dare to take that risk?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo and Orion were heirs of ancient families, both at least Class B metahumans, among the best of their generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they couldn't withstand Clarissa's fate power, who in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> could?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fear was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one dared to approach the Radcliffe family for marriage proposals anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen's brow remained furrowed as he continued, "Clarissa must marry soon! Otherwise, as that oracle warned, if she remains unmarried for too long, the fate power will turn against the Radcliffe family, bringing us disaster or, worse, leading to our extinction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hear your thoughts. With Apollo dead and Orion gone, who should we consider marrying Clarissa to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was filled with uneasy silence as everyone exchanged glances, unsure of what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dylan, since Clarissa is your own daughter, what's your opinion? Who do you think she should marry?" Eugen finally broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all eyes on him, Dylan had no choice but to say, "Dad, with Apollo and Orion gone, there's almost no one in the younger generation of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> who could compare to them. It's likely that no one will dare to marry Clarissa now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you're suggesting we look outside of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>?" Eugen prompted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan nodded. "</span><span>Skyefall</span><span> is a rather isolated place, not comparable to the surrounding provinces. The seven ancient families here are in a different league compared to those in neighboring areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard that the Paltrow family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> to the east has produced two young prodigies. They're both under thirty and already Class A power masters. They're formidable enough to consider marrying Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Clarissa's beauty, talent, and her fate power, I believe they would be interested. If Clarissa could marry into the Paltrow family, it would be a significant advantage for our family as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen's eyes lit up with approval. "That's an excellent idea! Take charge of this matter. Reach out to the Paltrow family or other prominent families in the surrounding provinces. We need to find a suitable match for Clarissa as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fate power is incredibly unpredictable. We can't endure the backlash any longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen concluded, leaning on his cane as he made his way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had arrived at the headquarters of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Valentin, is everything ready?"</span></p></div>
