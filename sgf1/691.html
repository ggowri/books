        <h1>Chapter 691 Godfather's Concerns</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Clarissa finished speaking, Osborne and Godfather's faces changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recalled the clones of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> that he had seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke of Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were they all cloned by the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> by extracting the genes of gods from the corpses of ancient gods?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> held the corpses of these ancient gods in his hands?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had enough Divine Bone Crystals to could clone more powerful beings in large </span><span>numbers?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had fought with these clones and knew their strength. The strongest ones had reached Class AAA, and they were numerous. If these clones became stronger, wouldn't their strength reach Class S?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large number of Class S clones?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath. Thinking of the scene where the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> controlled a large number of Class S clones, Osborne felt his hair stand on end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he succeeded, no one in this world could be his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could stop him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe only the resurrected ancient gods can deal with him, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather's face was also solemn, and he had obviously thought of the consequences. He and the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were mortal enemies and old rivals who had fought for decades. If the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' plan succeeded, the first person to be dealt with would definitely be him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like we are in big trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sit down and talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather motioned for Osborne and Clarissa to sit down and began to recall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, many years ago, I discovered that clones appeared in the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. They called themselves Evolved Humans. But at that time, I had just become Godfather, and my self-confidence was inflated. I didn't pay too much attention to these Evolved Humans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because in my opinion, they are just clones. They have congenital defects and their upper limit is not high. I don't think they pose a threat to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now it seems that I was wrong! They are not ordinary clones, but evolved humans cloned using the genes of ancient gods."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evolved humans have high upper limits! They can change the direction of the war. I only realized now that these evolved humans have become a force to be reckoned with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now that the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> has the Divine Bone Crystal. These evolved humans will become even more terrifying. I'm afraid the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> is plotting against more than </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather finished speaking and sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Clarissa looked at each other and felt the pressure from Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, don't you have any countermeasures? The people in Training Base No. 6 all can transform into vampires. What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather smiled helplessly, "Countermeasures? I once thought I had them, but now it seems that I misjudged the potential of the Evolved Humans, so my countermeasures may not be useful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For example, at Training Base No. 6 you mentioned, they can all transform into vampires because I have the genetic medicine that can transform them into vampires! </span><span>I captured the vampires from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> alive and used their bodies to research this genetic medicine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a total of ten training bases. The people in each training base use different genetic drugs and have different transformation abilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Transform into Medusa, Tauren, Titan, Werewolf, etc..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I once thought that they were enough to fight against the evolved humans of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, but now it seems their strength is far from enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compared to the evolved humans of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, they are too weak! Up to now, there are no more than ten Class AAA people in the ten training bases!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, more than fifty Class AAA evolved humans showed up this time alone! How big is the gap?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Godfather finished speaking, Osborne gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather said calmly, "However, they are only Class AAA evolved humans. No matter how many there are, I won't care too much! Because Class AAA beings cannot participate in the battle between me and the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I'm worried about is that the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> has the Divine Bone Crystal and can really clone a Class S evolved human!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that happens, I will definitely lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and said solemnly, "Then we will start a war against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> before he clones a Class S Evolved Human!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will break into the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> and kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Godfather sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I could kill the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, I would have done it long ago. He is very powerful, and most importantly, I've never seen anyone who does better in escaping than him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is also a spatial metahuman, and has mastered the Spatial Domain! Unless you're strong enough to suppress his Spatial Domain, no one can kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, by the time you grow up, he will probably have cloned enough Class S evolved humans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said seriously, "Even if we can't kill the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, we still have to start a war! At least we have to get the Divine Bone Crystal back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or, take back the corpse of the ancient god!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Osborne's words, Godfather was in great surprise.</span></p></div>
