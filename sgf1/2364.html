        <h1>Chapter 2292 More Dangerous-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were around three hundred people left, all raring to enter the fifth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert frowned a bit when he saw this number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his book, it was still way too many. He figured that no more than a hundred folks, maybe even less, would be able to move around freely in the fifth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He guessed that no more than two hundred could last for over an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest would get frozen stiff in the fifth layer in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since they were just going down there to take a gander and he could step in to protect them if they couldn't hack it, he kept his mouth shut and fired up the Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they landed on the fifth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spine-chilling wail rang in their ears, followed by a chorus of screams. Even though everyone had steeled themselves, knowing full well that the cold winds in the fifth layer would be even more brutal, they still whipped out their defenses in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, they'd underestimated just how nightmarish the fifth-layer cold winds were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, their defenses crumbled. The terrifying cold winds lashed at their bodies, leaving behind horribly gruesome wounds. Some of the wounds were so deep that one could see the bone, but not a single drop of blood oozed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was because the blood had been frozen solid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the defenses of at least dozens of people went kaput, and they let out ear-splitting cries of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stepped into the fifth layer, Clara, standing right next to Osborne, felt her Sacred Power defense start to fall apart. Her face went as white as a sheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Osborne was lightning-quick on the draw. In an instant, he cocooned Clara within his shield of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara emerged from the ordeal without a scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, her face was paler than a ghost. The bone-chilling winds of the fifth layer hit her like a sledgehammer, leaving her utterly gobsmacked. It was as if some powerhouse way above her league had launched a full-throttle assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't have the chops to withstand it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't the only one in a pickle. A whole bunch of the top-hundred power-ranked folks couldn't help but have their jaws drop. They felt like their Sacred Power defenses were hanging by a thread, ready to crumble any second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these guys weren't the panicky type. Instead, they rummaged through their stash and pulled out all kinds of Sacred Artifacts. Using the artifacts' might, they braced themselves against the howling cold winds. That gave them a bit of a breather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this stage, even the top-twenty ranked folks had to unleash their Sacred Power to fend off the frigid gales. Except for Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson, the rest were really struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a no-brainer that the Sacred Power of Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson was a cut above the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, these four had managed to blend three different types of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert flashed a faint smile. "Not half bad!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fifth layer is a real bear of an environment, but you've all held your own so far. That means you've got some aces up your sleeves! If lady luck is on your side, you could all make a splash in the state duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, if you're feeling in over your head, head back to the fourth layer right away. Then make your way back to the third layer on your own and wait for me. But if you're itching to take a peek at the sixth layer, you can stick around!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Rupert finished his words, a bunch of people decided to call it quits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fifth layer was a beast. Their Sacred Power defenses were getting hammered. Unless they were one of the top-hundred-ranked guys who had mastered a Sacred Artifact like the back of their hand, it was a pipe dream to move around freely and hunt for tokens in the fifth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the fifth layer was this nightmarish, the sixth layer was bound to be even more of a horror show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So they decided to throw in the towel. No point in even thinking about the sixth layer. One look might just land them in a world of hurt.</span></p></div>
