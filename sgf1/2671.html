        <h1>Chapter 2551 Enemy! Prince Hendrix!-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne decided not to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He activated Satan's Eye and looked into the situation inside the Empire Hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, inside the Empire Hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of guards surrounded two handsome men and beautiful women, each exuding a strong aura of Sacred Power, cautiously observing the surroundings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In front of them stood dozens of distinguished men and women.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These men and women were the top ten in the zone duels from various regions of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. They were all arranged to stay at the Empire Hotel, awaiting the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ten days later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they were all looking at the woman in front.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That woman was Seraphina. She was stunningly beautiful, so dazzling that anyone, regardless of age or gender, would momentarily lose themselves upon seeing her, accompanied by a sense of shame in their hearts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present was a prodigy from various regions, with top-notch talent and backgrounds, yet in front of Seraphina, they all felt a bit inferior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn&rsquo;t just because of her beauty but also because of her status.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She is the princess of the Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Greetings, Prince Hendrix!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Greetings, Princess Seraphina!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dozens of people, after a moment of distraction, immediately bowed to the two with respectful expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina remained calm and said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix smiled and waved. "No need to be formal, everyone! You are all the elites of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, true prodigies. Meeting you is my honor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words instantly made everyone feel as if bathed in a spring breeze, incredibly comfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Hendrix casually chatted with everyone, subtly hinting at recruiting them. Several people were immediately tempted and stepped forward, expressing their willingness to become Hendrix's right-hand supporters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, there weren't many such people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Out of fifty or sixty people, only six ultimately accepted his recruitment, while the others remained polite on the surface but didn't directly agree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This left Hendrix somewhat dissatisfied. After chatting for a long time and seeing no one else agree to his recruitment, he finally said his goodbyes and left with the six recruits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression looked a bit unpleasant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was observing Hendrix with Satan's Eye, his expression somewhat serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "Over a thousand years without seeing him, and Hendrix has already reached the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection cultivation level? Such rapid progress!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists, forcibly suppressing the anger in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Hendrix's seemingly unchanged face, Osborne wished he could rush up immediately, beat Hendrix fiercely, and break his arms and legs to avenge the humiliation and beatings he suffered back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he knew he couldn't do that!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not to mention the dozen powerful guards around Hendrix, at least at the Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection level, Hendrix's own strength alone made it difficult for Osborne to handle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix was no ordinary Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, undoubtedly a prodigy, even the top ten in the zone duel were far behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how confident Osborne was, he knew he was absolutely no match for Hendrix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unless he broke through to Empyrean Sacredness right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must endure for now! After the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ends and I enter Necropolis City, I can break through my cultivation level! By then, reclaiming the power stored in the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I can definitely reach advanced Empyrean Sacredness directly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, even if Hendrix is Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can easily defeat him too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne worked hard to suppress his anger and killing intent to avoid being sensed by Hendrix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hendrix came out with his people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're out! They're out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Seraphina is out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd was extremely excited. They immediately looked over, and then every face showed surprise, as if they were stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also took a glance, but he didn't feel anything special.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina might indeed be beautiful, but she is the sworn enemy Hendrix's younger sister!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne naturally had no good feelings toward Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just coldly watched the two leave, then took out the terminal to contact Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were also in the Empire Hotel at this time.</span></p></div>
