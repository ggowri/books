        <h1>Chapter 674 Founding the Blood Demon Organization</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Clarissa's words, Osborne was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did it mean that after he fused with the Blood Cross, all vampires were considered his subjects?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he the king of the vampires?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he really strip other vampires of their power with a single thought and even make them die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remembered the Duke of Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Duke of Blood Clan had a higher realm than him, Osborne effortlessly drained him of blood and killed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a Class AAA vampire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were someone with a lower realm, Osborne might really be able to end his life with a single thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath. "I understand! But to confirm if it's true, I have to try it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne approached Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you ready?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I'm ready!" Valentin responded excitedly and expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reached out and extracted another drop of blood energy from the almost dried-up Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he didn't let Valentin absorb it slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Valentin's Class B strength, it would take him a lot of time and effort to absorb the blood energy on his own without bursting his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shattered the blood energy and directly infused it into Valentin's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Valentin screamed in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his body quickly began to change. Fangs grew from his mouth, and sharp nails sprouted from his hands as he transformed into a vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His aura grew even more frenzied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It rose from Class B to Class B+ in just a few breaths of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was still growing rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Valentin broke through the confines of Class A, successfully becoming a Class A master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation stunned Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he felt speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he broke through to Class A, it had been a near-death experience. It had even left Isa nearly depleted of her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's breakthrough seemed too easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It really works! Is this how bestowing vampiric powers works? Does this mean that, from now on, I can make anyone transform into a vampire? And as long as the Blood Cross has enough energy, I can make them quickly become Class A masters, or even reach Class AA!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa spoke up, "Osborne, although you can bestow vampiric powers on anyone and make them transform into vampires, their lives will be closely linked to yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you die one day, they will die too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their lives are closely linked to mine? If I die, they will die? What if they die? Will it affect me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa explained. "You are their king. No matter what happens to them, it won't affect you. Moreover, because you are their king, their realms will never surpass yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are Class AA, their realms can only be at most Class AA. They will never be able to surpass you and reach Class AAA first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Clarissa explained, Osborne understood even better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression became solemn, feeling an immense pressure. It felt as if a heavy burden had been placed on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he died, all the vampires he had bestowed with powers would die, too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems I can't easily die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My life is now related to the lives of over five hundred people. Even if it's for their sake, I can't die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After contemplating this, Osborne told Clarissa, "Clarissa, this matter is absolutely confidential. Besides me, no one else can know about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I understand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Valentin finally returned to normal. He felt the immense power in his body and was filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin knelt on one knee in front of Osborne and said seriously, "From now on, my life belongs to you. Even if you ask me to go through fire and water, I will never frown."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne touched his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Valentin, there's no need to be so polite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he looked at all the members from Training Base No. 6 and said, "I'm planning to create a new combat organization called the Blood Demon Organization!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All of you, including Valentin, are now members of the Blood Demon Organization. This organization will be divided into three large combat groups. I will be the highest leader, and Clarissa will be the deputy leader. No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 will be the captains of these three groups. As for squad leaders and team leaders, you can choose them yourself and provide me with a list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, Valentin, I want your </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security to be responsible for the logistics of the Blood Demon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, everyone looked stunned, and they immediately knelt on one knee before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were fervent as they shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Demon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Demon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Demon!"</span></p></div>
