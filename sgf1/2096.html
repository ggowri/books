        <h1>Chapter 2087 Sudden Change</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of Ghostwing Insects being struck and exploding was sharp and clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies burst forth with dark purple blood that reeked of decay, sizzling as it splattered onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that their blood possessed a potent corrosive quality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for Alfreda and her companions, all of whom had reached Ascension Five Supernal Deity King level, there was no cause for concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having quickly learned the Ghostwing Insects' attack patterns and vulnerabilities, they found that despite the swarm's numbers, the threat was manageable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mere flick of her finger, Alfreda sent dozens of Ghostwing Insects bursting apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfrey was equally impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Pulse Rifle hovered in front of him, autonomously locking onto any Ghostwing Insect that revealed its energy signature. With swift precision, he unleashed a barrage of firepower, annihilating the insects in rapid succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hermione, surrounded by enormous phantoms of carnivorous flowers, had a unique method of attack. Whenever a Ghostwing Insect dared to approach, the flower apparitions lunged forward, their massive maws devouring the insects whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time a Ghostwing Insect was consumed, Hermione's face lit up with delight, as if she were savoring a gourmet meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neville, on the other hand, summoned a raging inferno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flames erupted from his hands, spitting out fiery tongues that engulfed the Ghostwing Insects, their purple-black blood igniting and sending plumes of black smoke swirling into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly had a different approach entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloaked in shadows, she wielded a sleek black dagger. With every swift movement, she sliced through the wings of Ghostwing Insects, sending them crashing to the ground where they detonated with a satisfying pop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyrus, the most composed of the group, took on the role of a protector.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood firmly in front of Osborne, Avery, and Arabela, his robust physique absorbing any stray attacks that slipped past Alfreda and Godfrey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Cyrus in front, Avery, Arabela, and Osborne felt like spectators, watching the chaos unfold with a sense of safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These Ghostwing Insects don't seem so dangerous after all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that we know their weak spots, taking them down is a piece of cake," Arabela remarked, her excitement bubbling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She unleashed bolts of lightning to dispatch one insect after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery frowned slightly. "That's because we have the numbers on our side! With nearly ten thousand of us in the mushroom forest, the amount of Ghostwing Insects each of us faces is manageable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if it were just the nine of us... the sheer volume of Ghostwing Insects would skyrocket to hundreds, if not thousands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think we could handle that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabela paused, her expression shifting as she absorbed Avery's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then stuck her tongue out sheepishly, realizing the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing around, Avery said, "I've always thought something was hiding</span><span> in </span><span>this forest. But aside from the Ghostwing Insects, there doesn't seem to be any other threats lurking around..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Godfrey and Hermione.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had formed a tight-knit team, having fought side by side for over fifty years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing something off, even without concrete evidence, Avery felt compelled to warn them, "Godfrey, Hermione, stay sharp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both nodded in acknowledgment, continuing their relentless assault on the Ghostwing Insects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alfreda and Beverly were also busy clearing out the swarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center of the group, Osborne remained protected. With a cultivation level of only Ascension One, he was the most vulnerable among them. A single attack from a Ghostwing Insect could easily take him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they fought their way through the swarm, the rest of the team kept a portion of their focus on Osborne, ensuring he remained safe and sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he wanted to help, he had little opportunity to jump into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no intention of joining the fray just yet. From his perspective, the Ghostwing Insects were hardly a threat. His teammates were more than capable of handling them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, his attention drifted toward the towering mushroom trees surrounding them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These mushrooms were colossal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the famed Elf Trees of Elf City seemed almost puny in comparison. As flashes of lightning tore through the sky, each mushroom pulsed with a kaleidoscope of colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enormous caps acted like gigantic umbrellas, casting shadows over an area that spanned several miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed that each mushroom seemed to tremble slightly, releasing a delicate, translucent powder that dissolved into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brow furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured to himself, "What's going on? Is that...spore dust?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of unease began to gnaw at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spores were not only transparent but incredibly fine; they were almost invisible unless one looked closely. Combined with the dimness of the environment and the chaos of battle, it was no wonder few noticed that the mushrooms were shedding a massive cloud of spores into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the spores blanketed the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, everything changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far from Osborne's group, another exploration team suddenly erupted in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several members of the squad's eyes glowed a haunting blue as if possessed. They had lost their minds, abandoning any thought of fighting the Ghostwing Insects. Instead, they turned on their teammates, launching frenzied attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had anticipated that while battling Ghostwing Insects, they would suddenly fall prey to their own comrades. Many were caught off guard, screaming in agony as they were gunned down by fellow explorers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The turmoil was not isolated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more people turned, their eyes spiraling into eerie shades of blue, completely losing their rationality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They struck at their companions, throwing themselves into a frenzy like they held a deep-seated hatred for each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, hundreds fell victim to this sudden infighting, slaughtered by their own teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to kill me? Well, I'll be taking you down, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic spread like wildfire. Almost every exploration team descended into chaos, glancing warily at their own team members, their faces a mix of rage and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation left the captains of various exploration teams bewildered and uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have they lost their minds?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As bedlam erupted, the Ghostwing Insects didn't let up on their assaults. If anything, their attacks became more frenzied, punctuated by the sounds of screams echoing through the mushroom forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before Alfreda's group faced their own strange turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabela and Neville's eyes also shimmered that ghostly blue. Their expressions turned frenzied as they launched themselves at Hermione and Avery without a hint of hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery was taken completely off guard by Arabela's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was flung backward, blood spattering from her mouth as she staggered, her face growing pale as a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Hermione found herself in an even worse predicament. In the midst of battling a Ghostwing Insect, Neville struck her from behind with overwhelming force, shattering her divine power defense. The impact sent her reeling, blood erupting from her as she fought to stay on her feet.</span></p></div>
