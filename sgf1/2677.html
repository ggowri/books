        <h1>Chapter 2554 Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the highest-ranked in Eastern Zone 3 was not Osborne, the champion, nor the joint runners-up Leroy and Clara, but Brenda, who ranked fourth!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She ranked 25th in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne ranked 28th.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, Osborne still heard many people around discussing that his ranking was too high, and that he was forcibly placed in the top thirty only because he won the Eastern Zone 3 championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, Osborne's combat ranking should be around the 50th place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Interesting! The Glorious Divine Kingdom actually sent nine princes and princesses to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel! This has never happened before! And placing all nine of them in the top nine of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings means everyone else can only compete for the tenth place?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's lips curled into a cold smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this situation, if the nine princes and princesses fail to win the championship and instead someone else steps over them to claim it, the entire Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom would probably feel humiliated!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne felt a bit eager to try.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He came for revenge. Although it wasn't time to act yet, stepping on all the participating princes and princesses during the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, and snatching the championship they thought was in their grasp right in front of all the Royal Family members of the Glorious Divine Kingdom...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That would definitely be interesting!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, Osborne planned to hide his strength in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and just deal with it casually, as his goal was merely to enter the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that his goal has been achieved, he doesn't care about the ranking in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as he can enter the Royal Sepulcher, pay respects to his mother, and access Necropolis City, that's enough for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he ranks at the bottom in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, Osborne doesn't care.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne has changed his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel is highly anticipated, with even warriors from Evernight Court and Phantom Commerce Guild coming to watch. In such a scenario, defeating all the princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, trampling them underfoot, and taking their championship...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This will surely make the members of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family feel furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's like a slap across their faces...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's lips curled up as he stared at the names of those nine princes and princesses, letting out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, he wasn't familiar with these princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all born after he was exiled from the Palace. If bloodline must be mentioned, these people could be considered his younger brothers and sisters from a past life...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no direct hatred toward them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But their mistake lay in being born into the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. If he sought revenge, no member of the Royal Family could escape unscathed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially Seraphina, who ranked first on the power leaderboard!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's brother is Hendrix, who once broke one of Osborne's legs!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hendrix, I can't deal with you for now, so I'll start by collecting some interest from your sister! I'll just... break one of her legs!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne turned and left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't care about his ranking on the Rankings at all. After all, whether it was the Sect Tournament, the Tempest Fortress City's city duel, the Zephyr State's state duel, or the Eastern Zone 3's zone duel, he was never favored in the beginning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, he managed to rank in the top thirty on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was already higher than any of his previous rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Osborne just wished for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel to start quickly. He couldn't wait to fiercely beat up those participating princes and princesses in front of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family members...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne returned to the hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, his terminal rang. He picked it up and saw that it was Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly answered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, where are you? I've arrived in Nebula City. Tell me your location, and I'll come find you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need your help with something!"</span></p></div>
