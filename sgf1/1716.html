        <h1>Chapter 1715 The Trouble Ahead</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's face darkened as everyone turned to her, confusion etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra, with her clever and mischievous demeanor, leaned in and whispered, "Are you seriously sick or something?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That can't be true; you're already at the Deity Overlord level! With a Divine Body like yours, how could you have some terminal illness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Osborne asked, frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah bit her lip and replied, "Thank you all for coming to my rescue, but it's futile! My identity has been exposed. The Bowman family has already decided I'm the one who killed Tobey. Their revenge and pursuit won't stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I survive, they'll turn their wrath on the Gellar family and even attack the entire Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City! I can't drag the Gellar family down with me, nor can I put the Mystic Feather Clan in harm's way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bowman family is far too powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Gellar family can't withstand their fury! Neither can the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City! So, ultimately, I'm marked for death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Hannah's despair deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed tighter. "What do you plan to do? Will you go after the Bowman family to protect the Gellar family and the Mystic Feather Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah hesitated but eventually nodded. "Yes! Only my death will appease the Bowman family's hatred toward the Gellar family and the Mystic Feather Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They'll be safe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As much as I want to live, I can't be that selfish! The Gellar family has over 10 thousand members, and the Mystic Feather Clan has more than a million! They can't die just because of me! I wouldn't be able to forgive myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, I can't escape! The Bowman family has my divine power signature; no matter where I hide, they'll track me down with a Spirit Tracer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their strength is beyond what we can imagine! They have quite a few Deity King warriors in their guard; there's no way I can get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing her monologue, Hannah managed a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But no matter what happens, getting to see you all one last time makes me really happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained unyielding, and his voice sharp. "I can't agree with this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tobey is the one I killed! You shouldn't have to take the fall for me. And more than that, you're my friend</span><span>. </span><span>I won't just sit back and watch you throw your life away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry; we'll find a way out of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah shook her head. "There's no way out! Aside from the West Zone, the whole Celestara is under Lord Malevolence's control! Essentially, it's at the mercy of the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't fight against the Bowman family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah sounded defeated, but Osborne's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who says we can't fight back? You just said it yourself</span><span>. T</span><span>he West Zone isn't under Lord Malevolence's thumb!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If things get too dire, we can always make a run for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And besides, it's far from time to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The bottom line is you can't act on your own. I'll come up with a solution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah opened her mouth, seeming like she wanted to say something, but as she looked into Osborne's determined eyes, she stayed silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Anastasia spoke up, her voice calm yet firm, "Hannah, don't be too worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Osborne says he'll help, he will! But do you really think approaching the Bowman family will solve anything? Do you believe that once you're dead, their anger will just vanish? Do you honestly think they won't keep targeting the Gellar family and the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's words left Hannah momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Continuing, Anastasia added, "From what I can gather, going to the Bowman family will get you nowhere! Although I haven't directly encountered anyone from the Paramount Supreme Clan, I've heard plenty about how ruthless and arrogant they are!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bowman family has already lost a talented fighter in Tobey and over a dozen of their guards. They're not just going to let that slide by killing you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished, Hannah's anxiety only deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're saying that even if I'm dead, the Bowman family will still go after the Gellar family and the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded gravely. "It's a harsh reality, but that's what I believe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, you can choose not to believe me and wait to see what unfolds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But since you're a friend of Osborne, he won't let you throw your life away like that. Ultimately, this mess started with him</span><span>. L</span><span>et him handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah stood there, momentarily stunned, her expression a mix of uncertainty and confusion as she looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne confirmed her unspoken question, saying, "Hannah, the truth is simple. If you want to know whether the Bowman family will cease their attacks on the Gellar family after your death, we can arrange for you to 'die' once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he glanced at the group of the Bowman family's guards sprawled out on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some lay motionless, but eight of them were merely unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a plan to turn these eight survivors into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"'Die' once?" Hannah echoed, her brow furrowed in confusion, trying to grasp Osborne's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without elaborating, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of minutes, he had transformed the eight guards into members of the Blood Clan. Once the job was done, he turned to them and said, "You're going to report back to Aldrich and let him know that Hannah has been killed."</span></p></div>
