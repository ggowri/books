        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ancient voice echoed through the cave, reverberating ominously. At the spot where Uriel had fallen, a translucent figure suddenly materialized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Towering and imposing, this spectral elder gazed intently at the Sacred Artifact-level palace, his excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the recent explosion of Sacred Power, the palace remained unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascending Sacred Sanctum! It's mine now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The translucent figure of the elder moved eagerly toward the Sacred Artifact-level palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, his expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He narrowed his gaze at a shadowy corner of the palace and bellowed, "Who's hiding over there?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show yourself! If you don't come out, don't blame me for what happens next!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cold, menacing voice sent chills through the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, two weary figures emerged slowly from the shadows&mdash;Osborne and Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were pale, reflecting the tension of the moment as they regarded the spectral elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder's surprise was evident as he took in the sight of the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? There are still survivors? I sealed a portion of Sacred Power within Uriel's body! If anything happened to him, that power would unleash, annihilating everything within 60 miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two... you actually survived?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip, choosing silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had felt the terrifying surge of Sacred Power within Uriel, which was unstable and ready to explode. In that critical moment, he activated interdimensional travel, hoping to escape the inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew that even with interdimensional travel, evading the blast would be nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power within Uriel was far too potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a true force of Sacred Power, unlike anything he or Alfreda had encountered before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That power, once unleashed, could easily crush their bodies to dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to find the only place that might save them&mdash;the Sacred Artifact-level Palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Alfreda dove into the palace just in time, praying it would shield them from the impending explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miraculously, his gamble paid off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the shockwave from the blast still left them injured and bloodied, they had survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same could not be said for the Umbra World beings, who were obliterated without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Wait... you're the head of the Ethereal Elven Temple!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One of the three Empyrean Sacredness warriors of Elf City&mdash;Isidore Rosedale!" Alfreda </span><span>exclaimed,</span><span> her voice filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder turned his gaze to her, surprise etched on his face, which quickly morphed into recognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, so it's you, Princess Alfreda of the Nature Elf Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of menace flashed in his eyes as he regarded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda felt a wave of fear wash over her, her body tensing as she trembled slightly. It wasn't until Osborne grasped her arm reassuringly that she felt a bit of relief, her complexion regaining some color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure before them was none other than the master of the Ethereal Elven Temple, a true Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His goal was the Sacred Artifact-level palace, and that complicated matters significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only silver lining for Osborne was that Isidore was merely a specter, not his true self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rules of the Umbra Earth continent dictated that only those under three hundred years of age could enter; anyone older would be struck down by the fearsome lightning from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This rule applied even to Empyrean Sacredness warriors, meaning Isidore could not step foot into the Umbra Earth in his true form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne considered for a moment, realizing that Isidore had likely hidden a fragment of his soul power within Uriel's body, using it to manifest here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single strand of soul power shouldn't be too strong, Osborne thought, and with that realization, he felt a wave of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Isidore spoke again, his tone surprisingly amiable, "Princess Alfreda, you two should leave. While this Sacred Artifact-level palace may be damaged, it's far beyond the reach of younglings like yourselves. If you attempt to seize it, you'll invite endless troubles. So, I suggest you make a hasty exit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's brows knitted in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exchanged a glance with Osborne, seeking guidance in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeping his demeanor steady, Osborne replied, "He's right, Alfreda. The Sacred Artifact-level palace isn't ours to claim. Only warriors like Mr. Isidore Rosedale are worthy of obtaining its power! Let's head out quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he gently took Alfreda's hand, guiding her step by step toward the cave's entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they found themselves standing next to Isidore's ghostly figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded toward Isidore, who returned the gesture with a warm smile, his demeanor surprisingly gracious, laced with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Osborne and Alfreda attempted to pass by, Isidore made a sudden move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand came crashing down toward them with astonishing speed. In a normal situation, there would have been no time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the two figures vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore's palm struck the ground with a deafening impact, creating a massive crater but leaving Alfreda and Osborne utterly unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had used interdimensional travel and reappeared over a thousand yards away, racing for the cave's exit with all their might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne growled, his expression gloomy as he pulled Alfreda along, "Damn it! I </span><span>knew that old coot wasn't up to any good!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Uriel understood the necessity of silencing us to keep the existence of the Sacred Artifact-level Palace a secret! Isidore would certainly do the same!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That old fox is devious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they fled, Osborne desperately cast interdimensional travel again, but the power was heavily suppressed in the Umbra Earth, limiting him to a jump of a mile at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them, a chilling voice snickered, saying, "You're quick on your feet!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like you've been preparing all along!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't even attacked yet, and you're already scheming your escape! Spatial power, huh? Too bad you can't outrun me!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you've learned of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, it's better for you to just die&mdash;I can't allow anyone to spill the secrets of the Sanctum!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne suddenly sensed a terrifying force barreling toward his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in shock. "Why is he so fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Osborne activated the Eclipse War Armor and donned the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Armor, pulling Alfreda tightly into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Isidore's devastating attack slammed into Osborne's back. The Eclipse War Armor shattered like fragile glass, splintering under the brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Armor, an Apex divine artifact that offered little resistance against Isidore's ferocity, crumbling effortlessly and losing all its divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's own divine power defense and physical strength followed suit under Isidore's onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming power penetrated every layer of his defenses, striking him with crushing force. Blood spewed from Osborne's mouth as he felt his body nearing a breaking point.</span></p></div>
