        <h1>Chapter 1635 Diana's Breakthrough</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A Deathborn Relic?!" Osborne exclaimed, a spark of excitement lighting up his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't expected such a delightful surprise&mdash;this was a genuine Deathborn Relic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Deathborn Relics were the crystalline eyes left behind by Deity Overlord-level Deathborn after their demise. These were no ordinary relics; they were mutated eyes, incredibly rare and valuable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each one contained a unique essence of Deathborn power. When activated, this essence could cloak the user, making them indistinguishable from other Deathborns, thus preventing attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only by defeating a mutated Deathborn could one hope to obtain a Deathborn Relic, which made them exceedingly scarce. The essence within was precious, diminishing with each use. In critical moments, it could mean the difference between life and death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A standard Deathborn Relic in the Divine Peak Nine outpost could fetch more than a hundred Ultimate Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The one before Osborne, harvested from a late-stage mutated Deathborn, was even more potent. Its Deathborn essence was richer, allowing for at least a dozen uses, and capable of deceiving even stronger Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its worth was several times that of a typical relic&mdash;potentially trading for over a thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne, Ultimate Essence Crystals were not an issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During his foray deep beneath Divine Peak Nine, he had amassed a considerable haul&mdash;certainly in the hundreds of thousands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To put that into perspective, Diana and Emmett, seasoned leaders among the miners, could only collect a couple of hundred crystals after a week of hard labor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire workforce at Divine Peak Nine, numbering over 10 thousand, managed to scrape together only a few tens of thousands of Ultimate Essence Crystals each month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even that amount was insufficient for the Ninth Dark Deity Legion's internal needs, leaving little for ordinary folk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, the Ultimate Deathborn Relic before him, capable of trading for a thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals, was a treasure of immense value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't just about having Essence Crystals; it was about being able to acquire such a relic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Put it away! This might come in handy later!" Osborne commanded, and his clone tucked the Deathborn Relic into Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the clone vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne's main body had arrived at the spot where Diana had been moments before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Riley and the others, there was nothing there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to Osborne, Diana was visible, encased in an isolated space&mdash;a separate realm carved out by his clone using Spatial Cleaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was deep in the process of breaking through her realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's almost there!" Osborne thought, feeling a rush of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that isolated space, Diana was completely safe; ordinary beings wouldn't even notice her presence, let alone pose a threat. Only someone with spatial power, like Osborne or someone significantly stronger, could sense something was amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But why did such a powerful Deathborn attack when Diana was about to break through to Deity Overlord? They seemed frantic to stop her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There's something big going on with her&mdash;some kind of secret?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A curse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, but he had no desire to pry deeper. Everyone had their secrets, and as long as Diana didn't pose a threat to him, that was enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Diana hadn't delved into Osborne's secrets either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the isolated space, energy surged violently as Diana made her breakthrough, the commotion startling even Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's not fully through yet, but with those divine power fluctuations, she's hitting the equivalent of a mid-level Deity Overlord's full-force effort, right? Her speed in cultivation is impressive, and her strength is formidable! The way she easily defeated Emmett at peak Celestial Deity rank despite being a late-stage Celestial Deity was no fluke&mdash;that wasn't even her full power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that she's broken through to the early stages of Deity Overlord, she's stronger than the average mid-level Deity Overlord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sighed, truly amazed, "This is what you call a super talent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, a monster! Give her enough Ultimate Essence Crystals and a safe place to train, and she'll become one of the top warriors in the Human Community before long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even he felt a pang of envy for Diana's incredible gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, after a thunderous explosion of divine power, Diana completed her breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense energy surrounding her gradually simmered down, settling into a calm that radiated strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled. He knew she had succeeded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a thought, Osborne reformed the spatial division, bringing Diana back into the fabric of reality right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she opened her eyes, a flash of brilliance danced within them, and a powerful energy burst from her&mdash;then slowly receded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You back with us?" Osborne said with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's face lit up in a warm smile, her eyes shining with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes! I'm awake! Thank you for saving me earlier! If it weren't for you, I'd be dead right now and wouldn't have been able to break through."</span></p></div>
