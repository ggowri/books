        <h1>Chapter 2195 Fierce Battle With Lord Malevolence-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence declared loudly, "Osborne, for all these years, I've been preparing to completely defeat you! I even intentionally suppressed my cultivation level, holding back from breaking through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I knew that if I simply broke through, with your talent, it would still be tough for me to truly overcome you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I needed to make my strength greater and have more trump cards to stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I choose to break through, it's because I feel absolutely confident in my victory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, the time has come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Lord Malevolence's body trembled violently, an even more terrifying power erupting from him. At the same time, his figure began to transform, his once lean form swelling like an inflated balloon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the most striking change was the emergence of two sharp horns from his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming power radiated from those very horns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown as a sudden surge of pressure washed over him. His eyes were fixed on Lord Malevolence, whose figure was expanding, and the horns on top of his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What are those?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Lord Malevolence stopped transforming. Sensing Osborne's bewilderment, he reached up and touched the two horns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One horn glistened like an ice crystal, bright and transparent, while the other glowed with a purplish-red hue, crackling with electrical discharges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence let out a soft laugh. "These are the dragon horns of the Sacred Dragon Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"More precisely, they're the horn of the Frost-enshrined Sacred Dragon and the horn of the Thunder-anointed Sacred Dragon! I shelled out a fortune to get them from the Cosmic Black Market. The process of fusing them was even more costly&mdash;I almost lost my life in the process!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it was all worth it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By fusing these dragon horns of the Sacred Dragon Clan, I've harnessed their awe-inspiring might! It encompasses both raw physical strength and elemental prowess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I may not measure up to the true members of the Sacred Dragon Clan, but it's more than sufficient to take you down! After all, the Sacred Dragon Clan is the apple of this cosmos' eye, the most powerful Apex Clan around!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you ready to be utterly vanquished and wiped out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's eyes glinted with confidence and a fierce battle lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face grew solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dragon horns of the Sacred Dragon Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And not just one, but two of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence has fused with the dragon horns of the Sacred Dragon Clan, gaining their physical strength and elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, this is his secret weapon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's truly terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne had never laid eyes on a member of the Sacred Dragon Clan, he'd heard endless stories about their legendary might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were on par with Lord Malevolence in terms of cultivation level, he wouldn't be daunted even if the latter were a genuine member of the Sacred Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the disparity in their cultivation levels was like an unbridgeable chasm&mdash;Lord Malevolence outclassed Osborne by a full six levels!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confronting such a vast gap was already a herculean task, and with Lord Malevolence's newly-acquired power, Osborne's sense of uncertainty grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he was resolute not to yield or show an ounce of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those dragon horns of the Sacred Dragon Clan are indeed formidable aces up your sleeve! But do you really think you can take me down with them? You're living in a fantasy! Come on, make your move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence gave a faint smile. "Very well! Let's see how you cope with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn on his forehead suddenly blazed with a blinding light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone present felt the temperature nosedive as if they'd been abruptly transported to a desolate frozen wasteland. The moisture in the air quickly solidified, turning into fluttering snowflakes and sharp ice shards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area around Lord Malevolence started to freeze at an alarming rate, turning the battlefield into a frigid prison.</span></p></div>
