        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time snorted, her powerful aura bursting forth, instantly countering the pressure from her opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash of their formidable energies filled the air, and though she felt like she was caught in a raging storm, her clothes billowing wildly around her, she stood her ground, undeterred. Gritting her teeth in anger, the God of Time retorted, "Who do you think you are? You want me to be your maid? To serve you? You think you're worthy of that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she unleashed a surge of divine power, aiming to strike down her adversary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he merely smiled, lifting a hand casually to deflect her attack as if it were nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, Ricky, looks like this little girl doesn't think much of you!" Tyrese chuckled, watching the scene unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Ricky! She thinks you're not worthy of her service and even dares to attack you! Why don't you show her what you're made of? Let her see your true power!" another voice chimed in, laughter lacing his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky Corenswet, an Ascension Eight warrior, simply smirked at their taunts. "I do have a soft spot for thorny roses! I'm claiming this maid for myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze locked onto the God of Time, and he continued, "You think I'm unworthy to be your master?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Zayne told me you're just a servant of the God of Night! Not just you, but the God of Light, Goddess of Fate, Goddess of Life, and even God of Death&mdash;all of you serve the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can be your master, why can't I? Do you really think I'm beneath him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time's fury flared at his words. "You? Compare yourself to the God of Night? You're nothing! Not even close!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky's expression darkened. "Is that so? Why don't you call the God of Night out here? I'd love to spar with him! Once I defeat him, you'll be more than willing to serve me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't kid yourself! You're not worthy to face the God of Night! I can take you down myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk! Let's just fight!" she retorted, her battle spirit ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, then! If you're looking for a fight, I'll gladly oblige! Once I capture you, let's see if the God of Night can keep his cool!" Ricky declared, waving his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone step back! I'll handle this woman myself! Time power is rare, and even fewer can master it to her level in the Racial Convergence Planet. I want to bend her to my will personally!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other six warriors exchanged knowing smiles and retreated to a safe distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ricky, be careful! Don't trip over your own feet! This girl may only be an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, but her talent is off the charts. Plus, time power is tricky to deal with. Don't underestimate her!" Tyrese warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had faced the God of Time before and had tasted defeat, even with an Apex divine artifact in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ricky faltered, it would save him some face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he lacked strength; it was just that the God of Time was a real heavy-hitter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax! I won't be as useless as you!" Ricky shot back, ignoring Tyrese's worried expression as he beckoned the God of Time with a casual wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! Show me what you've got!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time's face hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Ricky was far stronger than Tyrese, and if she didn't bring her A-game, she could be in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, the God of Time extended her right hand and grasped at the air, calling forth her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The River of Time, arise before me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the world trembled as a dazzling starry river suddenly appeared overhead, its shimmering lights coalescing into a breathtaking spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, everyone was captivated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky exclaimed, his eyes wide with astonishment, "Is that... a projection of the River of Time? She can actually summon it! They say if you can fully comprehend the River of Time, you can traverse the past, present, and future at will, wandering freely through its currents and uncovering the secrets of the cosmos!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I once saw an Empyrean Sacredness warrior who specialized in time power, and even he could barely manage to summon a projection of the River of Time! Yours is just as clear, if not clearer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remarkable! Truly remarkable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm even more intrigued by you now! I must bring you back to the Racial Convergence Planet. Even if I can't make you my servant, I'm sure the sect would reward me handsomely for </span><span>handing </span><span>you</span><span> over</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky's excitement was palpable as he fixed his gaze on the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Tyrese and the other five warriors were taken aback by the spectacle unfolding before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! You think you can capture me? You might want to rethink that!" the God of Time shot back defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then shouted, "River of Time, become my whip!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, she grasped the massive projection of the River of Time, transforming it into a long, flowing whip that she wielded with authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she swung it through the air, the very fabric of reality seemed to tear apart, annihilating everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky's expression shifted to one of alarm. "Using the projection of the River of Time as a weapon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a genius idea! And you've actually pulled it off! Impressive! Truly impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time smirked, pride radiating from her, "Now do you understand my power? Just so you know, this is what the God of Night taught me! Do you still think you're worthy to be compared to him? You don't even come close! Now, let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce swing of the Whip of Time, she lashed out at Ricky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew better than to take it head-on. The whip, made from the projection of the River of Time, was as powerful as any Apex divine artifact. Even if he was an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King, facing it directly would be perilous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ricky attempted to dodge, he realized with horror that escape was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Whip of Time, seemingly slow, moved with blinding speed, as if it transcended time itself, reaching him in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinding his teeth, Ricky raised a shield to protect himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, the Whip of Time struck his shield&mdash;a formidable Apex divine artifact&mdash;but it shattered like glass, splintering into pieces that flew in all directions, carrying immense destructive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Ricky screamed in agony as the whip tore through his defenses, slamming into his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent him reeling, his body convulsing as he felt a wave of weakness wash over him. His body was propelled backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finally steadied himself and looked down, Ricky gasped in horror. A gruesome wound marred his chest, the flesh writhing as if trying to heal but failing miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his dismay, he noticed his skin had taken on an unsettling appearance, covered in wrinkles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ricky! Your hair! And your skin..." A voice called out from the distance, shock evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky's face paled as he sensed something was terribly wrong. In a panic, he conjured a water mirror in front of him. Through its reflection, he saw his own visage&mdash;and froze in disbelief.</span></p></div>
