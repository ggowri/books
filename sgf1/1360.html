        <h1>Chapter 1359 Caution</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, only eight people chose to accompany Osborne to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Grandfather Sebastian, sisters Anastasia and Zoe, siblings Bryce and Kendra, and two more: Yulissa and Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Interestingly, Yulissa could be considered a half-sister to Osborne; years ago, he had disguised himself as Yulissa's brother to infiltrate the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, she still called him brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Just eight of us, plus the Blood Demon members, won't even total five thousand! Given this, it seems best to leave this Dimensional Microcosm for the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should I create another one?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still don't know what to expect in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, and with Grandpa and the others still at a low level of strength, it's crucial to have a Dimensional Microcosm for safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, I'll need to create another one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne set to work, constructing the new Dimensional Microcosm with ease, his experience making the process smooth. He didn't bother with excessive decorations; instead, he simply transferred the Mount of Gods Manor from the Pantheon League Dimensional Microcosm into the new one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mount of Gods Manor was stunning, with breathtaking scenery at every turn, and it was spacious enough to accommodate thousands of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once finished, he removed the old Dimensional Microcosm from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's petals and replaced it with the new one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the Augustine family's Dimensional Microcosm vessel, he'd need to find a secure location for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Blue Planet was now safe enough. Once he eliminated the remaining members of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization and the Dark Deity Legion, there would be no threats left to endanger the Augustine family's Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days passed swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days passed swiftly. The Blood Demon members had all completed their breakthroughs, with two thousand six </span><span>hundred</span><span> of them ascending to the rank of Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to deal with the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization and the Dark Deity Legion once and for all!" Osborne declared as he gathered the Blood Demon members and set out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he met up with the members of the Prophet Alliance. With their assistance, they pinpointed the locations of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization and the Dark Deity Legion's Dark Deities, one by one. The Blood Demon members swiftly dispatched them, eliminating the remnants of these forces without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with such overwhelming strength, the enemies had no chance to retaliate, only fleeing in desperation. It took the Blood Demon members a full week to track down and eliminate every last one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the Prophet Alliance confirmed that no one from these two dominant factions remained alive on Blue Planet, and the extermination campaign came to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, are you really planning to go to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>?" Eddie from the Prophet Alliance asked, surprised to hear about Osborne's imminent departure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Yes, Mr. Pike. Is there a problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie shook his head, then hesitated before saying, "I just didn't expect you to head to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> so soon! You seem confident; you must have a solid plan to open a dimensional portal to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie continued, "In that case, I'd like to send you a few words of caution on behalf of the Prophet Alliance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Osborne's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had witnessed the Prophet Alliance's prophetic abilities firsthand, and he knew their warnings were not to be taken lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They must have foreseen something significant for Eddie to relay such a message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps these simple words could save his life in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Pike, please go ahead," he urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie's demeanor grew somber as he gazed skyward, murmuring, "Once you reach </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, remember this: do not head west! For a whole year, stay away from the west, no matter what happens. If you come near, a great calamity awaits you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This warning comes from the Grand Elder of the Prophet Alliance, who insisted I pass it on to you as soon as I confirmed your journey to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew even more serious at Eddie's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The west? Did the Grand Elder foresee something? Can you elaborate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie shook his head. "I can't say anything more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know the details myself! All I know is that the Grand Elder insisted I warn you. For a whole year, steer clear of the west!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, then added, "There's one more thing the Grand Elder wanted me to tell you: be wary of the God of Time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Osborne's demeanor hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be wary of the God of Time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The God of Time is Ophelia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Grand Elder of the Prophet Alliance is warning me to be cautious of Ophelia? What exactly has he foreseen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a sense of foreboding washed over Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the unease settling in his gut, his journey to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> was already set in motion. He knew danger awaited him, but he had no choice but to proceed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly. "Mr. Pike, please extend my gratitude to the Grand Elder for his warning. I will tread carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne and Eddie parted ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, he completed his preparations and set his sights on the journey ahead.</span></p></div>
