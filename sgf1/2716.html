        <h1>Chapter 2588 Fearless-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne guessed that the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom would definitely manipulate the drawing results again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fact was just as he had guessed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Osborne's Satan's Eye, he personally saw Zorro secretly tampering and manipulating the drawing results.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The upcoming battles, who would face whom, had already been arranged in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought about it but ultimately chose not to stop or change it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To him, it didn&rsquo;t matter who he drew as an opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt there was no need to fight Seraphina now. Defeating her at this moment might completely crush the other princes and princesses, leaving them without confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let them keep their confidence for now, and shatter it in the end!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile and stepped forward to draw a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the drawing results were out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"First match, Princess Seraphina versus Prince Miles!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Second match, Princess Rosalie versus Princess Jasmine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Third match, Prince Matthew versus Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fourth match, Prince Sean versus Leroy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fifth match, Prince Emiliano versus Clara!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the draw results, Osborne couldn't help but let out a cold laugh. It was pretty much as he had predicted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only thing that surprised him a bit was that he had thought Clara or Leroy would draw Seraphina as their opponent, but they didn't.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne angrily thought to himself, "They arranged for me to face Prince Matthew, ranked third in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings! They didn't choose Emiliano, ranked second, probably because Matthew specializes in close combat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They saw me using the Bloodwrought Bow and assumed I could only attack from a distance, not skilled in close combat, so they want to use Matthew to exploit my weakness?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How ridiculous! So naive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't take this seriously at all. However, Clara's opponent, Emiliano, seemed a bit troublesome to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano is ranked second in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had watched his battles before. His strength wasn't as great as Seraphina's, but not far behind either. He felt Clara facing Emiliano would be an extremely tough fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was uncertain and didn't know if Clara could win.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, Leroy's opponent, Sean, ranked sixth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, but Osborne believed Leroy could win because Leroy hadn't shown his full strength yet!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All in all, this draw result isn't great, but it's not bad either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne walked off the stage with Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were the third, fourth, and fifth to appear, so it wasn't their turn yet; they could only wait.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"First match, Princess Seraphina versus Prince Miles! Let the battle begin!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle on the stage began.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina is ranked first in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, while Miles is ranked eighth. There is a significant gap in their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Miles didn&rsquo;t give up; after all, as a prince, surrendering would be shameful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, he was easily defeated by the furious Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Miles had almost no chance to fight back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina smoothly advanced to the top five.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Zorro announced the results, Seraphina stepped down from the stage but didn&rsquo;t return to the Royal Family&rsquo;s viewing stand. Instead, she walked toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said coldly, "Osborne, I'll be waiting for you in the top five! I said I&rsquo;d break your legs, and I will! But I doubt you&rsquo;ll even make it to the top five! After all, you might not even be a match for Matthew!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, if you can&rsquo;t even handle Matthew, then you&rsquo;re not qualified to be my opponent!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're just a worthless loser!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her tone was full of provocation and disdain. After speaking, she turned and left.</span></p></div>
