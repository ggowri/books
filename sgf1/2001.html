        <h1>Chapter 1995 The Miracle Never Came-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the hundred Supernal Deity Kings sent by the Human Community, twenty-two were killed, and sixty more were gravely wounded. Despite their best efforts, they couldn't pull off a win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the Unity Clan side, the casualties were slightly lower&mdash;fifteen dead and fifty wounded&mdash;but the toll was still devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though </span><span>God of Light</span><span> had ordered that surrender was an option, in the heat of battle, there often wasn't even time to utter those words before fighters were obliterated in the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, while this battle wasn't as brutal as the earlier ones&mdash;not nearly as many deaths, not as many total wipes&mdash;it still claimed the lives of thirty-seven Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Human Community, it was another loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After five border competitions, they had won just one, and lost four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span> gritted her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up were the Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings, and many of the top leaders from the Human Community's major factions were stepping into the ring themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even more came from the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors from the Sanctum were all fighters </span><span>God of Light</span><span> had personally guided and trained. Losing even one of them felt like a knife to her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But still, the same truth rang in her mind...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sacrifice was necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they could hold out until the God of Night returned, this war between the Human Community and the Unity Clan could end without losing too many lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, </span><span>God of Light</span><span> couldn't predict how many from the Human Community would make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe she, too, would fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe all of them&mdash;every last one of the hundred billion soldiers in the Human Community&mdash;would perish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to that, losing a few more on the arena seemed like a lesser cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span> forced her emotions into a cold, unfeeling state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From the start, I've never cared about winning or losing. But, if we can win more, that's better. At least it'll boost the morale of the Human Community forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we keep losing, though, the spirit of the Human Community is going to hit rock bottom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought this, but there was nothing she could do to change it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between the Human Community and the Unity Clan was real. Winning would require not just stronger will and determination, but also luck&mdash;and, of course, the explosive rise of a few super geniuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the upcoming battle between the Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings didn't bring that kind of turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community had its talents, but the Unity Clan had even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the Human Community lost again in the battle between the Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings. This time, the losses were a little smaller&mdash;only eleven Supernal Deity Kings fell, victims of bad luck and the inability to surrender in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the Unity Clan side, seven Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings lost their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next came the battle between Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community lost again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the Human Community's coalition had gone completely silent. Everyone was watching as their warriors fell one after another on the viewing platform, each defeat sinking them deeper into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though there was anger, the reality of the power gap was undeniable. They had no choice but to accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was desperately hoping for a miracle&mdash;some extraordinary talent from the Human Community, someone who could defy the odds and turn the tide, bringing victory and honor, and crushing the Unity Clan's arrogance once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the miracle never came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the Human Community lost six Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings, while the Unity Clan only lost two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then came the final battle&mdash;the showdown between Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would be the last fight of the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings were far stronger than their Ascension Three counterparts. They had passed the second trial of the Ascension Stairway, making them even rarer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one was a cornerstone for the Human Community's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, each side would send ten of their Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings into the ring for an epic clash&mdash;one that would shake the very foundations of the arena.</span></p></div>
