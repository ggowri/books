        <h1>Chapter 2230 Shocked Crowd-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Wooden Golem of the same cultivation level? Hardly a challenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even geniuses with a cultivation level one or two tiers above would find it difficult to hold their ground against Osborne's companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were simply that strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the crowd gathered around the arena was left </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>. Those who'd been so sure that swapping out the Wooden Golem would turn the tables felt like they'd just been given a reality check, a stinging slap in the face. They clammed up, not daring to utter a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was crystal-clear now that the Golem was in perfect working order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real game-changers were the fighters in the ring&mdash;Bryce, Diana, and Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their raw power at Ascension Three far exceeded all expectations, allowing them to knock out the Ascension Three Wooden Golem with a single punch each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They effortlessly defeated their opponents, leaving the onlookers initially shocked and then speechless as the scene unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Kendra, Mila, Zoe, and Anastasia took their turns, with Zoe, already at Ascension Four, leading the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the other three were still at Ascension Three, regardless of their cultivation levels, they all dispatched the Wooden Golem with a single, effortless strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the Golem went flying, hitting the ground and struggling to rise, looking so pitiful that it had become little more than a punching bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It left everyone utterly silent, their eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance and his mates went from mere spectators to hopefuls, only to be plunged into disappointment and finally fall silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first skeptical that the Wooden Golem was broken, they quickly grasped that the problem wasn't the Golem at all; it was that Osborne's gang was just way too powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them boasted incredible fighting skills, making the Wooden Golem look like a pushover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance loathed to admit it, but he had no option as the truth ate away at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't shake the annoyance of knowing that Maddox had recruited these folks into Peak Seven's inner circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger they got, the more it ticked him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, right then, he didn't dare voice his complaints or rile them up more because the Elders of Peak Seven had shown up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching Bryce, Diana, and the rest effortlessly take down the Wooden Golems, the Elders started paying attention, huddling together to quietly watch the action in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Anastasia, having reached Ascension Four, also flattened the Golem with a single strike, the Elders' eyes sparkled with excitement, and they whispered to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were glued to Bryce, Diana, and the others, brimming with eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dawned on Terrance like a bolt from the blue&mdash;the Elders were into Osborne's gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might even want to take Osborne's gang under their wings as disciples!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Terrance gritted his teeth, trying to hold back his mounting annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, he'd set out to undermine Maddox and stop Osborne's gang from waltzing into Peak Seven as inner disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his meddling had backfired, turning into a platform that showed off their skills and caught the Elders' eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the Elders were probably eyeing them as future prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If any of them became the elders' disciples, their status and clout would shoot through the roof. Even someone like him would have to think long and hard before picking a fight with them in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like he'd pulled a major blunder on himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Maddox couldn't resist showing off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot Terrance a scornful look and sneered. "So, still full of yourself, Terrance? We've got five more candidates queued up for the practical tests! You up for more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance's temper flared up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">More tests?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It'll just give them more chances to show off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm </span><span>outta</span><span> here!" he barked, getting ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a powerful voice boomed, "Let's keep the assessments going! The ones who just fought really impressed me, but I'm itching to see what the other five can do. If they shine, I might just take them as my own disciples..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone went dead silent, too shocked to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen?!"</span></p></div>
