        <h1>Chapter 2423 Glacier Region</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A loud bang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The great battle in Abyssal has lasted three days, spanning half of </span><span>Abyssal's</span><span> territory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne sat on Flash's back, watching from a distance the fierce battle between the Magma Devourer and Gerald's group.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle had lasted three days, yet the Magma Devourer was still in great condition, while Gerald and the others were extremely exhausted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne noticed their numbers had significantly decreased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the beginning, there were about 120 judges, but now there are fewer than 80.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than a third of the judges had either died at the hands of the Magma Devourer or were forced to withdraw from the battle due to severe injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, the judges' situation was becoming increasingly dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If this continues, the judges might be completely wiped out! How much longer until the rescue team from Glorious Divine Kingdom arrives?" Osborne muttered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara also said worriedly, "Osborne, if the judges are wiped out, the Magma Devourer will come for us next! With its speed and strength, we might all end up dead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and corrected her, "Not us, but everyone else! With Flash around, even if we can't handle the Magma Devourer, it won't be able to catch us. We'll still survive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But the other contestants will be in danger! Unless they have some special means to escape, they're doomed and won't be able to withstand the Magma Devourer's attack!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head as he spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps only he knew why the Magma Devourer was so furious and determined to kill all of Brenda's contestants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's because they carried the scent of the Beast Soul Flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda, Dustin, Mckinley, and others had all been to the volcanic area and found the Beast Soul Flower. By now, after fighting together for three days, every contestant was already tainted with the scent of the Beast Soul Flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Magma Devourer saw them all as thieves who stole the Beast Soul Flower and was determined to kill them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They took on this disaster for me!" Osborne thought to himself. "If I hadn't picked all three thousand Beast Soul Flowers from the volcano's core area, the Magma Devourer might not have been this furious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must find a chance to kill the Magma Devourer as soon as possible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne made up his mind, but he knew it wasn&rsquo;t the right time yet. The Magma Devourer was still powerful. If he confronted it now, he would most likely be killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! We should head into the glacier area..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Magma Devourer likes high temperatures. In this glacier area, its power will be suppressed again. Maybe the judges can find a chance to injure the Magma Devourer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, I'll have my chance!" Osborne ordered Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash withdrew his gaze, turned around, and dashed into the glacier area at lightning speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The temperature plummeted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The climate here is somewhat like the sixth layer of Arctic Maw Chasm, just without such intense storms, but the temperature is about the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy both had to unleash Sacred Power to protect themselves from freezing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So cold!" they said with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't think Brenda bringing the contestants to the glacier area was a good choice! Although it can stop the Abyssal Snake, Bloody Ivy, and </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee from pursuing them, reducing the ambushes they face, the harsh environment here alone will cause them immense trouble!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not to mention the Ice Beetle here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once swarms of Ice Beetles appear, they're even scarier than Bloody Ivy or Abyssal Snake..." Leroy said worriedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought she made a lot of sense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, he said, "Maybe Brenda has her own ideas! Besides, if they stay in the desert area, they will eventually be overwhelmed by the increasing attacks from native creatures. And they're too close to the Magma Devourer there; if it catches up, they won't be able to escape."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The glacier area may have the threat of Ice Beetles, but as long as they are careful not to disturb the sleeping Ice Beetles, it's safer here than the desert."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy nodded and said, "Hope they stay safe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's focus on ourselves first! With unexpected events like the Magma Devourer showing up, this zone duel could end at any moment. We need to gain more to secure a spot in the top ten!" After saying this, Osborne activated Satan's Eye again and started searching for Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For others, the Ice Beetle was something to avoid at all costs, fearing to disturb it, but for Osborne, it was a rare resource and a chance to earn Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the Ice Beetle wasn't easy to find.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Around them were thick layers of ice, and the Ice Beetle's color was almost identical to the glacier, plus they were only the size of a fist. Even if thousands of them were sleeping together in the glacier, it wouldn't be easy for Osborne to spot them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could only search for the Ice Beetle slowly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Satan's Eye didn't disappoint Osborne. He quickly discovered some traces left by the Ice Beetle and followed them to its resting place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a small Ice Beetle swarm, roughly ten thousand in number.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne exclaimed in surprise, "There are ten thousand Ice Beetles here. Each one can be exchanged for two thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>! This single swarm can be worth twenty million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll test their strength first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took out the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow and fired an arrow. The arrow pierced through the thick ice layer and exploded among the Ice Beetle swarm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the massive explosion sent the Ice Beetle swarm flying, scattering them everywhere. However, to Osborne's surprise, not many of the Ice Beetles were killed. Most of them quickly got back up, flapping their crystal-like wings, their eyes gleaming with a cold light, and charged furiously at Osborne, Leroy, and Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured softly, "Their shell defense is strong, much tougher than the Abyssal Snake's skin! Plus, they naturally control ice elements, can move swiftly through glaciers, and even fly at high speeds..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're definitely not easy to deal with! But they do have a weakness&mdash;they fear extreme cold!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ice Beetles living in glacier regions have a weakness&mdash;they fear extreme cold! They are immune to physical and energy damage because their shells are incredibly tough. Anyone below the level of Empyrean Sacredness would struggle to break through their shell defense and harm their bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They aren't even afraid of Flame!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flame can't cause them much harm; they have ways to extinguish it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What they truly fear is extreme cold beyond their body's limits!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne has a way to deal with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Flash, it's your turn!"</span></p></div>
