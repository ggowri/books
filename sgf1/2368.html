        <h1>Chapter 2294 Kick Off-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, everyone trailed Rupert out of the Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they escaped that brutal environment, a collective sigh of relief swept through the group. Even though the world around them was still buried under a thick layer of snow and ice, and the bone-chilling cold still nipped at their skin, it felt like a slice of heaven compared to what they'd endured inside the chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd never imagined that a frozen, snow-covered landscape could feel so darn cozy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could have their druthers, they'd never set foot in the Arctic Maw Chasm again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, well, that was where the state duel was going down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bright and early tomorrow, they'd have to plunge back into its depths, on the hunt for tokens, ready to fight until the ten mightiest warriors were selected to represent Zephyr State in the whole Eastern Zone 3's zone duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next seven days were going to be spent holed up in the Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, head back now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get some shut-eye! Once the state duel kicks off tomorrow, you probably won't get a moment's peace. If you want to come out of the state duel with something to brag about, you gotta roll up your sleeves and fight harder than the rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words ringing in their ears, Rupert shepherded everyone back to the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thousand participants scattered like leaves in the wind, each making their way back to their own digs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also made a beeline for his courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All along the way, folks were still chewing the fat about what they'd seen in the Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good gravy! What a mind-blower today was! I'd only heard tales about the Arctic Maw Chasm before. I knew the environment in there was rough as a cob, like a no-go zone, but I'd never laid eyes on it myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seeing it for real today, I realized those stories weren't just hot air! And we only scratched the surface above the sixth layer! I've heard it's a whole lot scarier below the sixth layer. Supposedly, a bunch of Empyrean Sacredness warriors have bought the farm in there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, the conditions there are tougher than old boots! I've made up my mind. I'm only gonna stick to the top three layers. There's no way I'm going below the fourth layer. I'd be a goner before I even knew what hit me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm with you on that. I'm staying in the top three layers, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can tough it out in the fourth layer for a few hours. I'll be shuttling back and forth between the third and fourth layers! The tokens in the fourth layer are a whole lot more valuable. Finding one token in the fourth layer is like hitting the jackpot compared to finding ten in the third layer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count me in on that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm green with envy for those who can stay in the fourth layer for ages! And those who can operate in the fifth and sixth layers for long stretches, their scores are gonna leave ours in the dust!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No point in being jealous. That's just the difference in strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, there are only about a dozen folks who can really make a long-term go of it in the sixth layer. The rest can only last a few hours at best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And there are only around a hundred who can stick it out in the fifth layer for a good while!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid all this banter, Osborne made his way back to his Courtyard 8 in Zone One. Clara tagged along behind him, itching to hash out some strategies for the state duel tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shut the courtyard gate behind him and turned to face Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara didn't beat around the bush. "Osborne, I can't hang in the fourth layer for long. I can barely last six hours tops! So, I've made up my mind. I'll bounce between the fourth and third layers to hunt for tokens. Once I find them, I won't register them right away. I'll hold onto them until I meet up with you, then hand them over for you to register. That way, the points will go straight to your score!"</span></p></div>
