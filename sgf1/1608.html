        <h1>Chapter 1607 Boost in Insight</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was a picture of astonishment. While cultivating, he felt a unique energy from the heavens enter his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind became crystal clear, and his cultivation state was better than ever, far surpassing the norm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was familiar with this sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remembered that in Emma's Death's Stare, there was a peculiar energy that would enter his body through their intimate contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This energy could even rewire his brain neurons, gradually enhancing his insight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the transformation, his neurons would become incredibly active, boosting his insight by tenfold or even a hundredfold in a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was experiencing a similar boost in insight, though not as powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was probably only doubling or tripling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's insight was already formidable&mdash;he had yet to meet anyone with greater insight; even Isa had praised his quick learning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this added boost, his cultivation effect reached an astonishing level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "Cultivating near Divine Peak Nine actually enhances my insight? I wonder if this is just for me or everyone else, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought it would take another two or three days to break through to the mid-stage of </span><span>Level Six for my lightning elemental essence, but now I feel like I can break through before dawn tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made him feel a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to find out if this was an isolated incident and discreetly ordered his Blood Clan subordinates, who had free time, to give it a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, their responses came in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, we also feel the boost in insight! The cultivation effect here is amazing. I feel like I've finally understood things that baffled me before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, I tried cultivating in two different spots. The closer to Divine Peak Nine, the stronger the insight boost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, I asked a friend who's been here for months. He confirmed that cultivating here definitely enhances insight, and the closer you get to Divine Peak Nine, the stronger the effect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rumor has it that at the Divine Peak Nine encampment, the insight boost is only about two times. But if you reach the outer perimeter of Divine Peak Nine, the boost can be tenfold. Deeper within, it's even more potent... Maybe even a hundredfold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind was bombarded with the reports from his Blood Clan subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was a mask of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His initial feeling was right&mdash;the boost in insight was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It varied from person to person, but even the weakest effect was a doubling, the strongest a tripling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne himself felt his insight had tripled, which was the best result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What stunned him most was that the insight boost was directly related to the distance from Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closer one was, the stronger the effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just reaching the edge of Divine Peak Nine could yield a tenfold boost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tenfold! Osborne knew that cultivating under such conditions would lead to rapid advancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he also felt a hint of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such remarkable cultivation effects must surely come with drawbacks or risks, right? If not, then why aren't the geniuses from those major clans flocking here to hone their skills? There has to be something off about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne urged his Blood Clan subordinates to dig deeper, and before long, fresh reports came flooding in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, we've uncovered some vital information. Cultivating here does enhance one's comprehension, but it can't be done for too long. Prolonged exposure can lead to bouts of madness, causing disruptions in soul power and random hallucinations, and in severe cases, it can even injure the very essence of one's soul&mdash;turning a person into a lunatic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The closer you get to Divine Peak Nine, the more unstable your soul essence becomes. Hallucinations pop up out of nowhere, and it doesn't take much for a person to slip into insanity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's already been seen before&mdash;many have risked their sanity to grasp a stronger level of understanding, training just a stone's throw from Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In no time, they'd fallen into madness, simply vanishing into the depths of Divine Peak Nine, never to be seen again. This includes numerous Deity Overlord warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rumor has it, the higher one's realm, the easier it is to fall prey to these illusions. Only those with exceptionally powerful soul power stand a fighting chance against them, though even that isn't a foolproof guarantee...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more one enhances their comprehension, the greater the peril!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the information was painstakingly compiled, it became clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over two thousand individuals dedicated to gathering this intelligence, the efficiency far surpassed Osborne's own efforts, and he quickly got the lay of the land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hallucinations? Mental disturbances and frantic soul power? </span><span>So</span><span> it all leads to madness in the end?"</span></p></div>
