        <h1>Chapter 2629 Toby-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Royal Treasury, one hundred million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can exchange for a high-quality Superior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, one battle point is roughly equivalent to one hundred Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The 3.3 million battle points he owned were equivalent to over 300 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's a considerable amount, but not particularly astonishing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least for Osborne now, the items that these battle points can exchange for are far from satisfying him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the advantage of battle points over Kingdom Duel Scorepoints is that they can be used to exchange for almost anything, while Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can only be used to redeem Sacred Artifacts in the Royal Treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rare items not found in the Royal Treasury cannot be exchanged, no matter how many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints one has.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at the phantom and decided to ask further to gather more information. "What kind of existence are you? How should I address you? Here, can anything really be exchanged as long as there are enough battle points?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The voice replied, "I am the Artifact Soul of the Celestial Spire, essentially the soul of the Celestial Spire. You can call me Toby! However, keep in mind that not everything can be exchanged. If it's something I don't have, you won't be able to get it either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But almost everything you can imagine is here. If I don't have it, then you definitely don't have enough battle points to exchange for it. So, your battle points can probably get you anything equivalent that you can imagine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel a bit unconvinced after hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Toby has such an arrogant tone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everything I can imagine, he has? And the things he doesn't have, I can't even imagine?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit unconvinced at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Really? Then can I exchange for a Perfect Dragon Elixir here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he looked at Toby provocatively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby's words carried no emotional fluctuation. "The cosmos is vast, with countless items, and their names vary. So, please first clearly outline the shape and characteristics of the Perfect Dragon Elixir in your mind, and only then can I answer you accurately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and quickly began imagining in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So that's it!" Toby said calmly, "You can indeed exchange for the Perfect Dragon Elixir here. However, your battle points are far from enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne widened his eyes upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't believe that the Perfect Dragon Elixir could actually be exchanged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hurriedly asked, "Then how many battle points are needed to exchange for a drop of Perfect Dragon Elixir?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby replied, "One billion battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly did the math, then widened his eyes in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One billion battle points can only exchange for a drop of Perfect Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Based on the value of battle points, one hundred million battle points are enough to exchange for a high-quality Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the price of Perfect Dragon Elixir is at least ten times, even dozens of times, that of a Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt shocked. He currently only has 3.3 million battle points, still far from one billion battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he might still have a chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "If I can keep completing the trials, I can continuously accumulate battle points. Maybe one billion battle points isn't impossible to achieve."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne continued to ask, "Can I exchange for an Imperial Artifact here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby listened and gave a faint smile. "An Imperial Artifact? Of course, it can be exchanged. The most basic Imperial Artifact only requires five billion battle points."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne widened his eyes again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't believe an Imperial Artifact was actually this cheap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The price of five drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir can exchange for the most basic Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is equivalent to the price of fifty Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fifty Supreme Sacred Artifacts can be exchanged for one Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Probably everyone would choose to exchange without hesitation. Not just fifty, even five hundred or five thousand, someone would still be willing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, the Royal Treasury of the Glorious Divine Kingdom has at least over ten thousand Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom doesn't even have a single Imperial Artifact.</span></p></div>
