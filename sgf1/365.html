        <h1>Chapter 365 Osborne's Plan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of The Wise Order suddenly erupted into heated debate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they were aware that the Paltrow, Luther, and Walker families were ganging up against the Augustine family, no one could agree on a way to counter this threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some argued for reaching out to the other five ancient families, while others </span><span>suggested lying low and shifting their focus for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all these ideas were shot down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a round of intense arguing among the dozen or so members of The Wise Order, they found themselves no closer to a solution. No one could sway the others or come up with a foolproof plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Isaac raised his hand, calling for an end to the bickering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Brian, then shifted his gaze to Osborne, who had been quietly observing the whole time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's your take on this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered for a moment before speaking up. "I've got a few thoughts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hear them, then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac wore a serious expression, all ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, "As you've all feared, even if we inform the other five families about the alliance between the Paltrow, Luther, and Walker families, they might not believe us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They may even wait to see the Augustine family fall before considering an alliance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hit home, and the room fell silent as everyone considered the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family was the weakest of the families in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the other five ancient families, taking on the alliance without the Augustine family might not make a difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could even be advantageous to let the three families eliminate the Augustine family first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when the Augustine family was truly out of the picture might the other families believe in the alliance of the Paltrow, Luther, and Walker families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, trying to form an alliance with the five families right now isn't our best move." Osborne concluded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should we do, then?" Isaac pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "What we need to do is start spreading the word quietly. Let the five families know about the alliance between the Paltrow, Luther, and Walker families, but do it covertly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Isaac was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you just said they won't believe us even if we tell the five families now. That doesn't sound like a good plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "You're not getting my point. We don't spread the news as the Augustine family. We do it anonymously. We keep our involvement a secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are several benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, the Augustine family stays in the shadows, out of harm's way. The Paltrow, Luther, and Walker families won't know we're the ones spreading the news that we took down the Ghost Ship or that we have evidence of their alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, what will the five families do when they hear this? They won't fully trust it, but they can't ignore it. They'll be suspicious, concerned that the alliance might be real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, they'll investigate and verify. This will distract the Paltrow, Luther, and Walker </span><span>families, making them more cautious to avoid exposure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This way, they will be less focused on us, and we'll seize the opportunity to rebuild, regain our strength, and prepare for the final battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the meantime, we'll leak more evidence of the alliance periodically, deepening the other families' suspicions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over time, those suspicions will harden into certainty. When we present them with solid evidence, will they still refuse to ally with us against the alliance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A profound silence fell over the room as Osborne finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of The Wise Order looked surprised, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Isaac slapped the armrest of his wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll do it! I'm backing Osborne's plan. We'll secretly leak the news to the five families, make them suspicious, and keep them busy investigating the alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While the Augustine family will use this time to overcome our challenges and regain our strength quickly. When the time is right, we'll present the evidence and ally with the five families to stand against the alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the only way we'll survive! But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's face showed a hint of embarrassment. "The Augustine family isn't exactly known for our business acumen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a faint smile. "If you trust me, leave the business side to me. I guarantee I'll get the Augustine family's cruise line back on track in no time, maybe even better than before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's eyes lit up at the prospect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac made his decision. "Alright! In the name of the great elder, I'm putting the Augustine family's cruise business in your hands. I hope you can lead us out of this predicament and back to the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you pull this off, I'll personally commission a statue in your honor. And even if you ever part ways with the Augustine family, know that we'll always have your back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement, and Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was finally time for him to show his capabilities.</span></p></div>
