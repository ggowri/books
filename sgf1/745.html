        <h1>Chapter 745 Turning Everyone Into Vampires</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everyone was ready, Osborne waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his gesture, over five thousand drops of blood energy appeared before him, radiating a dense, powerful aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These blood energies were what remained after Blood Cross couldn't absorb any more from the Evolved Humans Osborne had slain earlier: Luca, Palmers, and twenty other Class AAA Evolved Humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, he had planned to distribute these blood energies among the members of the Blood Demon Organization to help them increase their strength and break through their current levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Godfather rewarding him with experts from the nine training bases, he decided to use these blood energies to transform all of them into Vampires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each drop of blood energy could turn a person into a Vampire and significantly boost their power. Most importantly, since Osborne was the "Primogenitor of Vampires", they would never betray him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they became Vampires, Osborne could harness the power of the Blood Cross to help them grow stronger even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, transforming all members of the Blood Demon Organization into Vampires would be beneficial, and there would be no drawback for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only in this way could Osborne ensure that in the near future, the Blood Demon Organization's strength would match or even surpass that of Godfather's Draco Armed Services Branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even hoped to make the Blood Demon Organization the most powerful, terrifying, and unified force in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare yourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as soon as Osborne finished speaking, over five thousand drops of blood energy scattered and flew to each member of the Blood Demon Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, everyone began to absorb them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half a day later, everyone had absorbed the blood energy and gained the power to transform into Vampires. In a way, they had already become Vampires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their strength had increased to varying degrees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the ten individuals who had reached Class AAA, the improvement was minimal. These blood energies were negligible to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for those in Class AA, the boost was much more significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, many in Class A+ broke through to Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Class AA members in the Blood Demon Organization suddenly surged to over a hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The greatest improvements were seen in those at Class B+ and Class A-. After absorbing the blood energy, they all successfully transformed and broke through to Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, everyone in the Blood Demon Organization was at least Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the over five thousand Blood Demon members above Class A, Osborne was filled with intense excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "It's a pity that the number of top-tier Class AAA members is still too small. Otherwise, the Blood Demon Organization could already rival superpowers like the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was thrilled, but thoughts of the Aberrants quickly sobered him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "The Aberrants launched a war, and more than thirty Class AAA Evolved Humans died at my hands, but to the Aberrants, that was nothing. I didn't inflict a strong blow on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This means the Aberrants must have well over a hundred, possibly even several hundred, Class AAA Evolved Humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the King of the Aberrants obtaining the Divine Bone Crystal, he might clone more Evolved Humans in the future, perhaps even Class S Evolved Humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aberrants are the truly terrifying ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon Organization is still far from being formidable enough. It's not the time for arrogance yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne calmed himself completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "But one day, I will make my Blood Demon Organization stronger than the Aberrants! One day, I will lead the Blood Demon Organization to crush the Aberrants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne touched his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the power of the Blood Cross surging within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The existence of the Blood Cross was the source of his confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone is dismissed. Continue training! All Battalion Commanders and Deputy Battalion Commanders, stay behind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave another order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, only twenty Battalion Commanders and Deputy Battalion Commanders of the Blood Demon Organization remained by Osborne's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recognized two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were No. 1 and No. 2 from Training Base No. 6. Their names were now Eleventh Augustine and Twelfth Augustine. Although they weren't Class AAA, they were quite close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These twenty men looked at Osborne eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After transforming into Vampires, they naturally developed fear and reverence toward Osborne. Even the ten among them who were Class AAA, with ranks technically higher than Osborne's, were very respectful to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, "I called you here to show you something good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took out several energy pistols, energy rifles, and energy sniper rifles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I plan for all of you to be equipped with these weapons in the future. Try them out now. Don't aim at people, though; it could easily get out of hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, the twenty men were shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weakest among them was already at Class AA, so it had been a long time since they had used firearms. They hadn't expected Osborne to hand them these weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though puzzled, they obeyed and tried them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they were all utterly stunned.</span></p></div>
