        <h1>Chapter 1384 Human Overseer</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stone house fell into a heavy silence, leaving only Harry, Amelia, and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained quiet, his mind racing as he processed the earlier confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick, the Dark Deity overseer, was a Superior Deity, and even Vance, with his beady eyes and scheming demeanor, was an Intermediate Deity&mdash;far beyond what Osborne could handle in his current state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been on high alert, ready to flee at a moment's notice, but now that the crowd had dispersed, he finally let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the worried expressions on the faces of the siblings, he felt a surge of gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Harry and Amelia hiding his identity and agreeing to Patrick's outrageous demand for triple the Essence Crystals, he might have been in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His injuries were severe; if Patrick had decided to end him, escape would have been nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said sincerely, "Harry, Amelia, thank you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for covering for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise I'll find a way to handle the extra Essence Crystals. I'll repay you for saving my life, I swear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The siblings snapped back to attention at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia replied, her smile a bit strained, "Osborne, you really don't need to say that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll figure out the Essence Crystal situation. Triple the amount is a lot, but we've had our share of luck. With some effort, we can make it work. Right now, you need to focus on healing, and as for repayment, don't even mention it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're helping you because we want to, not because we expect anything in return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could see through her forced smile; the burden of Patrick's demand weighed heavily on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt even more grateful for her kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a harsh environment like </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, where human lives were fraught with danger, Amelia's compassion was a rare gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined to repay their kindness, he thought, "Once I regain my strength, I'll make sure to take care of those oppressors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry chimed in, his expression serious, "Osborne, you really don't have to worry so much. My sister is right. We're not helping you for any kind of reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, even without you, Vance and Patrick would find another way to target us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's face darkened, worry etched in his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, curious. "Harry, do you have a grudge against Vance? He seems to be targeting you on purpose, even though you're all from the same village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that Dark Deity overseer, Patrick... if I'm not mistaken, he's human, right? I thought only members of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion could hold that position."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia exchanged glances, a shared sigh escaping their lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry admitted, his tone heavy with resentment, "Yeah, Vance and we definitely have a history. A few months back, Amelia and I stumbled upon a rich vein of Essence Crystals&mdash;over a thousand of them, all clustered together. While we were mining, Vance showed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When he saw the crystals, he wanted us to split them with him. Naturally, we refused, and things got heated. We ended up teaming up to give him a good thrashing, but he's held a grudge ever since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lately, he's been cozying up to Patrick, and now he's practically a lapdog, using Patrick's protection to bully us at every turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's eyes burned with anger as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Patrick, yes, he's human. The title of Dark Deity overseer is usually held by Dark Deity members, but the big shots in the Ninth Dark Deity Legion have been known to appoint obedient humans to keep a tighter grip on the rest of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry sighed deeply, the weight of their situation settling heavily on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These human overseers, in many ways, are even more despicable than the real Dark Deity supervisors! When confronted with Dark Deities, they're always obsequious, bending over backward to fawn and flatter... but when dealing with us humans, they're arrogant, unreasonable, and bend over backward to oppress us. They resort to beatings and torture at the slightest provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're scum! They're nothing but lapdogs of the Dark Deity Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They ceased being human a long time ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia's eyes burned with fury, tinged with an overwhelming sense of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his anger flare at the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry, with a forced smile, gave Osborne a light pat on the shoulder. "Alright, let's keep these thoughts to ourselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Definitely don't let anyone outside hear us talking like this, or we're done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, just focus on getting better. We'll handle the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, we better hurry up and finish our meal. We've got to get back to the mines. If we don't have enough Essence Crystals to hand over in seven days, Patrick won't let us off easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't worried about not having enough Essence Crystals in seven days, considering his Dimensional Space held over 50 thousand of them&mdash;a day's haul for him.</span></p></div>
