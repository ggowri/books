        <h1>Chapter 2229 Unimpressive-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce had sent a Wooden Golem of the same cultivation level flying with a single punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How's that even possible? How can a Wooden Golem be this useless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was charged, and the crowd exploded into a chaotic hubbub.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People were raising their voices as they argued about what had just transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did the Wooden Golem break down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wouldn't put it past it! Those Golems haven't been used in forever. Maybe there really is something wrong with it. How else could that guy knock it out with one punch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously, who could pull that off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Definitely not me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be a glitch with the Golem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, Terrance and his gang exchanged nervous looks. When Bryce sent the Wooden Golem flying with a single punch, they all jumped to their feet, their faces showing utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance whirled around to </span><span>Jamaal,</span><span> his voice sharp. "What's going on? Did you pick a defective Golem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamaal looked totally confused. "Terrance, it's not my fault! Your teacher personally gave this Golem to me. He tested it himself. There's no way it's broken!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance's face clouded over, with barely-contained rage boiling inside him. "Then how the hell did it get taken out with one punch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This was supposed to be the toughest batch of Wooden Golems! Even you and I would have a hard time beating it at the same level. If there's nothing wrong with it, how could that kid knock it down with one strike?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamaal was at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead sure the Wooden Golem was working fine, which made him come to one realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't the Golem that was the issue; it was Bryce's insane strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamaal shook his head, not wanting to believe the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "Maybe it was just a lucky shot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go check it out right away! Next time, there won't be a screw-up like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Jamaal rushed onto the arena, eager to take a look at the Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Bryce just shrugged. "Is this really all the Peak Seven practical assessment has in store? This Golem's not impressive at all. What a letdown..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Terrance, a sneering grin spreading across his face. "So, does that mean I've passed the practical assessment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance's face turned as gloomy as a brewing storm, with a glare full of pure hatred burning in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You think some low-level Ascension Three punk can take me on? Just you wait! I'll find the right time to make you regret this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Passed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much Terrance wished he could deny it, Bryce had beaten the Wooden Golem of the same cultivation level. He had no more excuses to give Bryce a hard time and had to announce the result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Terrance shot a look at Osborne and the others standing nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! That was just a stroke of luck. The rest of you will have a much harder time getting through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamaal came back and confirmed that there was nothing wrong with the Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next one!" Terrance said icily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me give it a go! I'm the weakest!" Diana piped up with a smile and walked towards the arena, letting the Wooden Golem scan her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the Golem lunged forward. It carried a force much like before, but this time it was even swifter and more powerful, like a wildfire spreading faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Diana stayed as cool as a cucumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gentle yellow glow wrapped around her. It was the essence of the earth elemental, oozing strength. It made her small frame look like a colossal golden-lit warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Golem struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana didn't flinch or fight back. It was as if she wanted to feel the Golem's power for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a thunderous thud, the Golem hit Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yellow energy around her just gave a soft flicker, barely moving, and then steadied itself again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great hit!" Diana said with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in a sudden burst of power, the yellow force flared up and sent the Golem flying backward. It smashed into the edge of the stage and didn't get up right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stood there, a clear winner!</span></p></div>
