        <h1>Chapter 2427 Rare Time Metahuman</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash let out another dissatisfied dragon roar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I am a dragon! And I am an Astralwreck Dragon, the strongest and most ferocious among all dragon clans. My opponents should be those powerful monsters, like the Magma Devourer!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I want to fight it and see if Silicon-based Lifeforms are really that powerful. I want to show it that Carbon-based Lifeforms can be strong too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As an Astralwreck Dragon, my body is no weaker than any Silicon-based Lifeform!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>My opponent shouldn't be small bugs like Ice Beetles!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But due to Osborne's orders, Flash had no choice but to attack, despite his reluctance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a roar, he unleashed a blue Dragon's Breath, sweeping through a large area ahead. Instantly, all the Ice Beetles were frozen and fell like hail.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before they hit the ground, they were enveloped by the ocular energy of Osborne's Satan's Eye. In an instant, they were all absorbed into the Satan Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Done!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne flashed a bright smile. This Ice Beetles swarm was still small, with just over ten thousand, but they were worth thirty million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The main thing is, it&rsquo;s so easy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They don&rsquo;t need to do anything, just have Flash spit out a Dragon's Breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only problem is, Flash is a bit unhappy about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash won&rsquo;t go on strike, right?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If so, I do have a way to deal with Ice Beetles, but it definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be this easy. I&rsquo;d need to spend a lot of time and effort," Osborne thought, stroking his chin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Flash's loyalty to him, it&rsquo;s unlikely he would go on strike. Primordial once said that the Astralwreck Dragon is the most loyal pet beast. Since Flash has recognized Osborne as his master, even if Osborne asked him to die, he would obey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne couldn&rsquo;t ignore Flash&rsquo;s dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I can&rsquo;t ignore Flash&rsquo;s feelings just because he won&rsquo;t refuse my orders! Flash is, after all, just a newborn cub. If he keeps harboring dissatisfaction, he could easily become obsessive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne took out a Beast Soul Flower from Satan Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, catch this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne tossed the Beast Soul Flower to Flash. Flash tilted his head, caught the Beast Soul Flower in an instant, and swallowed it in a few bites. He immediately became happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne patted his head and said with a smile, "Flash, I need a lot of Ice Beetles! So next, can you help me get some? I'll reward you. For every group of Ice </span><span>Beetles</span><span> you help me kill, I'll give you a Beast Soul Flower. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne coaxed Flash like a child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash understood his meaning and immediately nodded excitedly. Then he rubbed his big head against Osborne's chest, showing a docile and obedient demeanor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately felt relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although each Beast Soul Flower was worth a million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, it was originally prepared as food for Flash, so Osborne didn't feel it was a waste to feed him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, every time a group of Ice Beetles was dealt with, Osborne could earn at least tens of millions of Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. So, rewarding Flash, who did the hard work, with a Beast Soul Flower was well-deserved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he hit the jackpot!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After calming Flash, Osborne activated Satan's Eye and continued searching for Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey? Are Brenda and the others going deeper?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There seem to be signs of battle there. Did they encounter Ice Beetles too? Looks like there were quite a few casualties. It seems they faced at least thirty thousand Ice Beetles, but they took care of them all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was quite surprised. Looking at the battle traces left by Brenda and the others, he thought, "What happened?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could Brenda and the others really take down thirty thousand Ice Beetles so quickly? Even though they have eight hundred people, it still seems unlikely, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Osborne sensed an extremely powerful ice power here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly had a bad feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Brenda's team, there are also people who can quickly deal with Ice Beetles. This way, their resource acquisition speed will greatly increase.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "If only I could know what happened here before!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy smiled and said, "You want to know what happened here? Unless there's a time metahuman here! And it would have to be a metahuman who has cultivated time elemental essence to above the Sacredness Level to barely make it possible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Leroy in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What did you say? A time metahuman who has cultivated elemental essence beyond the Sacredness Level can know what happened here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne's expression turned strange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He possessed time powers. Although it was the ability of Satan's Eye, Satan's Eye was a part of his body, so it also meant he had control over time powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Satan's Eye was already at the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This meant Osborne's time powers had the same effect as someone who elevated time elemental essence to the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy looked at Osborne in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My master told me that as long as a metahuman elevates time elemental essence to the Sacredness Level, they can perform simple Time Retrace! Although this can't let them travel through time or return to the past, it can allow them to understand what happened in the past!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately felt excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Time Retrace?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll try!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne immediately began to try.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's eyes widened in shock, staring at Osborne in disbelief. "Osborne, you didn't master time powers, did you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't hide it and nodded in acknowledgment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara were completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked in confusion, "What's wrong with you? Is this really that surprising? Time metahumans are rare, but they do exist, right? I mastered time powers. Why are you all so shocked?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara exchanged a glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said, "Osborne, you mastering time powers isn't surprising? Don't you know that on Racial Convergence Planet, there hasn't been a time metahuman for tens of thousands of years?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned. He thought, "On Racial Convergence Planet, has it really been tens of thousands of years since anyone mastered time powers?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Are time metahumans really that rare?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Racial Convergence Planet is so vast. There might be countless beings. The surrounding Stellar Region has various large and medium life-bearing planets, small life-bearing planets, and even tiny life-bearing planets. And those warriors will eventually gather here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such circumstances, there hasn't been a time metahuman on Racial Convergence Planet for tens of thousands of years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's impossible!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although time metahumans are rare, there shouldn't be such a long absence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, just on Celestara Planet, besides me, Ophelia is also a time metahuman."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, you said you want to try Time Retrace. Could it be that you've already raised the time elemental essence to Sacredness Level or above?!" Leroy asked again, his face full of shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Osborne hasn't broken through to Empyrean Sacredness, but he has already raised the elemental essence to Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, but in the end, he didn't tell the whole truth. He explained, "Actually, my time powers aren't normal! They come from a 'treasure.' I don't have time elemental essence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll try first to see if I can retrace what happened here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he immediately started trying.</span></p></div>
