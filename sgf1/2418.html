        <h1>Chapter 2332 A Series of Battles-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne had pulled off some amazing stunts, Angela just couldn't shake the gloomy feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since the state duel kicked off, everyone knew there were four super geniuses in the mix&mdash;Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them had fused three types of Sacred Power, putting them in a league of their own compared to the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had managed to beat Conrad and Lincoln. But Angela was watching the whole thing from afar via projections. She had no idea that Osborne had also fused three powers, so she didn't hold out much hope for his fight against Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she wasn't alone; her thoughts were pretty much in line with what the other onlookers were thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson going up against Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a no-brainer. Everyone knew it was gonna be a total mismatch. Apart from Broderick, Horace, and Agatha, no one could hold a candle to Benson. They'd be flattened like a pancake in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the fight got underway, the folks in Frost Peak City were left gobsmacked. They stared in disbelief as Osborne and Benson went at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me Benson's not really trying, right? Or maybe he got his butt kicked when he fought Agatha?" one spectator gasped, eyes as big as saucers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why the hell hasn't Benson wrapped this up yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How the heck is Osborne blocking all of Benson's attacks? What's the deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I seeing things, or is Osborne actually giving Benson a run for his money? I must be dreaming, but it looks like Osborne's getting the upper hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others joined in, each one more flabbergasted than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was in the same boat. She gawked at the projection, completely gobsmacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Osborne was holding his own against Benson was like a bombshell in Frost Peak City. It wouldn't be long before the news spread like wildfire across the entire Zephyr State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could it be that Osborne might actually pull off a win?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wow, I really sold him short!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let loose arrow after arrow at Benson. Benson gritted his teeth and fought back with redoubled determination, but against Osborne's Satan's Eye, every move was as clear as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could spot the weak spots in Benson's attacks. If he'd wanted to, he could have taken Benson down with a whole lot less effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he chose to go head-to-head with Benson, aiming to probe Benson's limits. At the same time, it was also a test of his own mastery of power. If he shot an arrow and shattered Benson's attack, yet the Sacred Power arrow remained intact, it meant he had overused his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conversely, if the Sacred Power arrow dissipated but Benson's attack remained unbroken, it meant he had used too little power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it turned out, Osborne had now reached a remarkable level of power control. Every time, he could precisely shatter Benson's attacks without wasting an iota of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle raged on for a solid five minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne figured it was about time to wrap things up. Benson's face had turned as pale as a sheet, his Sacred Power was running on empty, and his strength was starting to wane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Benson charged forward, fueled by an unwillingness to accept defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made up his mind to end this fight, as he noticed that Broderick was fast approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's finish this," Osborne declared, not increasing the power of his next arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it was slightly weaker, but its trajectory had shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye guiding him, Osborne had pinpointed Benson's vulnerabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This arrow was aimed right at Benson's weak spot.</span></p></div>
