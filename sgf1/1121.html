        <h1>Chapter 1120 Are You a Dark Deity</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia looked down at Osborne with a mocking glint in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You hate her, so wouldn't it make you happy if I made her disappear forever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth, fury boiling inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of answering her directly, he asked, "You're a Dark Deity, aren't you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dark Deity?" Ophelia paused for a moment, then laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe, but that's not the point! If you hadn't pushed her to despair, I wouldn't have been able to take over her body. Right now, I'm just asking you on her behalf: if you had another chance, would you still refuse her apology? If you had given her just a sliver of hope, she wouldn't have been replaced by me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip, refusing to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's expression hardened. "Looks like I already know your answer! In that case... you can go ahead and die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a wild killing intent flashed in her eyes, and an overwhelming power surged around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a calm voice cut through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! God of Time, welcome back! But you can't kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words hung in the air, a tall figure appeared suddenly in front of Osborne, </span><span>blocking Ophelia's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart leaped at the sight of her, relief washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isa's words sent shockwaves through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Time?! She's the God of Time? The one who's taken over Ophelia's body is the God of Time?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned, unable to process what he had just heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But neither Isa nor Ophelia paid him any mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia fixed her gaze on Isa, confusion etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? How do you know me? And what gives you the right to command me? If you know I'm the God of Time, why aren't you kneel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore an air of arrogance, as if she were untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sighed, "God of Time, I've been searching for you for a long time. I'm glad to see you fully awakened and restored to your power! Your return brings us a glimmer of hope! As for who I am, that's irrelevant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What matters is that I won't allow you to kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't allow me to kill him? That's a joke! Who do you think you are? What gives you the right to speak to me like that? You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied calmly, "I'm his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And as for if I'm looking for death? Just try me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's fury erupted. "You're his woman? What gives you the right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm his wife! I am! If you want to die, I'll be happy to oblige! Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wildness flickered in Ophelia's eyes, and a terrifying power surged forth from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the battle unfolded in an utterly bizarre manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's bewilderment, the moment Ophelia struck, it felt like the fight was already over. Isa remained standing right in front of him, seemingly just shifting her position slightly, while Ophelia suddenly found herself a hundred yards away, blood trickling from her mouth, her eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight appeared to have concluded, yet Osborne had seen none of it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stared at Isa, her expression grave. "Who the hell are you? What gives you the ability to traverse the river of time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa responded calmly, "God of Time, times have changed! Now that you've regained your power, you should understand&mdash;we're not enemies; we're allies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have a common enemy waiting for us to confront!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's face twisted in a mixture of anger and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Osborne, then back at Isa, her eyes filled with madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Common enemy, you say? That's rich! Do you really think we can pull it off? It'd just be another suicide mission! I don't care who you are, but don't think you can trick me into diving into certain death! If you're eager to throw your life away, by all means, go ahead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I fought hard for this second chance at life. I'm not falling for that again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My life, my call!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ophelia gave Osborne a final, piercing look and declared icily, "I'll be </span><span>back," before her body dissolved into thin air, vanishing without leaving a single trace of energy ripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa remained rooted to the spot, staring at the direction she had disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, she sighed deeply, turning to face Osborne with a mocking grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, look who got thrashed to a pulp! Still, it's commendable; you actually had the guts to take on the God of Time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glared at her as he struggled to his feet, casting a Light of Redemption on himself to finally heal his shattered bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Isa still smirking, he shot another glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Is that funny to you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mind explaining? Why was Ophelia's body taken over by the God of Time? Will she die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned deeply; concern etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa raised an eyebrow. "Think the God of Time took over Ophelia's body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wrong! Ophelia, she is the God of Time!"</span></p></div>
