        <h1>Chapter 2520 Illusionary Space Shattered-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I finally got the thousandth Demon Dragon's Breath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne used the Heaven Arrow to kill the last Illusionary Heavenly Demon at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, reached out to grab a Demon Dragon's Breath, and his expression was incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's really too hard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, he finally did it. On the fifteenth day of entering the Phantomagic Realm, he collected a thousand Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Demon Dragon's Breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A thousand Demon Dragon's Breaths can condense into a drop of Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne placed all the Demon Dragon's Breaths together. They quickly intertwined and fused, eventually forming a drop of Dragon Elixir radiating multicolored brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A word instantly flashed through his mind: perfect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the Perfect Dragon Elixir, far stronger than the Legendary Dragon Elixir. Just a trace of its aura emanating made Osborne feel as if he saw countless stars twinkling, from the beginning of the Big Bang to their destruction...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is Enlightenment State!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly stored the Perfect Dragon Elixir into the jadeflare vial and sealed it with Sacred Power. Only after ensuring no aura leaked out did he breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Just a trace of its aura almost pushed me into Enlightenment State! The effect of this Perfect Dragon Elixir is too powerful! If I take it directly, I might need a long time to fully absorb it and wake up from the Enlightenment State."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now is not the time for me to use it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While there's still time, I need to collect more Perfect Dragon Elixirs! Such treasures are probably rare even in the deeper parts of the universe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne immediately took action again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what puzzled him was that after wandering around for a long time, he didn't encounter a single Illusionary Heavenly Demon. All the Illusionary Heavenly Demons in this independent illusionary space had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Could it be that I've already killed them all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply. He originally wanted to seize the time to collect more Perfect Dragon Elixirs. However, he couldn't find a single Illusionary Heavenly Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, he suddenly felt the entire starry sky shaking violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, cracks began to appear in his vision, as if the heavens and earth were about to split apart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Like glass shattering, more and more cracks appeared. Suddenly, at a certain moment, with a crisp sound, everything broke apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne found himself back in darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he sensed some distinct auras not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation didn't make him nervous; instead, it filled him with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "That independent illusionary space has shattered!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I&rsquo;ve finally escaped from that independent illusionary space and returned to the Phantomagic Realm!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he looked into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There, Osborne sensed the presence of several warriors. At this moment, his Satan's Eye activated, instantly revealing those people clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's actually them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in Osborne's eyes, Azael and his elder were standing cautiously in the Phantomagic Realm, carefully observing their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and let Flash take the form of a warhorse. After transforming back to his previous appearance, he mounted Flash and approached them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who's there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Osborne didn't hide his presence, Azael and his elder sensed him as soon as he approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they saw it was Osborne, they heaved a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So it's you, Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael quickly greeted Osborne with utmost politeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Osborne single-handedly and effortlessly killed several advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors from Cobalt Island. Azael had long been intimidated by his strength and dared not be impolite.</span></p></div>
