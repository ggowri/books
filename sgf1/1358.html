        <h1>Chapter 1357 Departure</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt an unwavering certainty: the world hidden deep within the fabric of space was vast, magnificent, and powerful. Though its energy fluctuations differed from those of Blue Planet, they were undeniably of the same essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had to be </span><span>Celestara</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years ago, </span><span>Celestara</span><span> had been reduced to ruins by the terrifying power of Lord Malevolence. Millions of deities had perished in the chaos. In a desperate bid for survival, the Seven ultimate Deity Kings had united to confront Lord Malevolence, nearly shattering </span><span>Celestara</span><span> in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, they managed to defeat him, but killing him outright was impossible; they could only seal him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the aftermath left </span><span>Celestara</span><span> steeped in the scent of death, making it uninhabitable for any living beings. In a bold move, the God of Space forcibly extracted a relatively intact piece of land from </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, allowing the God of Death to cleanse the area of its deadly aura. This effort gave rise to what is now known as Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the true </span><span>Celestara</span><span> was sealed deep within the dimensional void at a great cost, as the God of Space sacrificed divine power to ensure that both Lord Malevolence and </span><span>Celestara</span><span> remained imprisoned forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne sensed that the world he was reaching for was indeed the sealed </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the distance closing between him and </span><span>Celestara</span><span>; if he could just extend </span><span>the dimensional portal a few tens of thousands of miles, he would have a real shot at breaking through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he was running on empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the borrowed strength of over 100 thousand Blood Clan members, boosting him to the mid-tier of Transcendent Deity, he could only manage to open a portal of 90 thousand miles&mdash;any further was beyond his capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy heart, he watched the nascent portal collapse, his power dissipating as he furrowed his brow in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma Divine Shadow, God of Star, I can sense that a dimensional portal to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> can indeed be constructed here, but my current strength just isn't enough! However, in a few days, I believe I'll be able to do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A plan began to form in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few days, once the members of the Blood Demon had completed their breakthroughs, he could harness their power. At that point, he would be able to open a dimensional portal exceeding 120 thousand miles, giving him a strong chance of connecting directly to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a few days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow and God of Star perked up, excitement flickering in their eyes. While the portal to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> hadn't formed yet, at least there was hope on the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was only a matter of days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could use this time to prepare; after all, venturing into </span><span>Celestara</span><span> meant they might not return to Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment of hesitation crossed Divine Shadow's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Let's reconvene in a few days. I still have some matters to wrap up on Blue Planet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he could open the portal to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> right now, he wouldn't step through just yet. There were still pressing issues to resolve back home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization and the Dark Deity Legion still had remnants that needed to be dealt with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he entered </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, he wasn't sure how easily he could return. Osborne had to ensure that everything on Blue Planet was settled before he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was the Augustine family to consider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wrestled with the decision of whether to bring them along to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. The dangers there would undoubtedly be greater, and the environment harsher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Augustine family, Blue Planet was their home, a place where they thrived. After all, they had become the strongest family on Blue Planet; staying behind would allow them to continue living a better life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Osborne decided it was best to let the Augustine family choose for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who wanted to stay would receive his help in creating a Dimensional Microcosm, allowing them to remain on the Blue Planet as its rulers, developing their realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For those who wished to join him, he would welcome them without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's give it a few days to prepare, and then we'll come back," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Osborne, accompanied by Divine Shadow and the God of Star, returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arrival, Osborne delved into the Augustine family's Dimensional Microcosm and convened a meeting with all the family's high-ranking members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Enter </span><span>Celestara</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that Osborne was planning to leave Blue Planet for </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, the Augustine family's high-ranking members were dumbfounded. Their brows knitted with concern and hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke calmly and resolutely, "I must go to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> for several reasons. First, my parents might still be alive there, and I need to find them. Second, my girlfriends are waiting for my assistance in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, and I must rush over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Third, the rules of Blue Planet are incomplete, limiting us to Transcendent Deity at most. To become stronger, I must venture into </span><span>Celestara</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm already a Superior Deity, so I need to prepare soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But no need to rush; you can choose freely. Your realms are far from Transcendent Deity, so you can stay on Blue Planet and join me once you're stronger and I've established a footing in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>."</span></p></div>
