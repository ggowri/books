        <h1>Chapter 2639 Narrow Victory</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne entered the twenty-seventh floor of the Celestial Spire, Seraphina and the others had already adjusted their states and reached the eighteenth floor of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remaining eleven of them spread out across the eighteenth floor, searching for the trial area of the eighteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Found it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, they finally found the location and quickly gathered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the light and Battle Points Monument on the eighteenth floor, Seraphina felt her breath become incredibly rapid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The final floor! As long as we pass the trial of the eighteenth floor, we can obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket. Our mission will be complete! I will also earn my father's praise and rewards... Even Weston won't dare to mess with me anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking this, Seraphina felt very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! Begin our final trial! There's no need to hide anything now. We'll unleash all our power, just for this battle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina stepped into the light first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano, Matthew, Rosalie, Yunus, Jasmine, these six geniuses of the Royal Family, along with the other five who hadn't been eliminated, all followed her inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And opponents quickly appeared in front of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These hundred warriors' projections were all advanced Empyrean Sacredness, exuding an incredibly powerful aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina took a deep breath. "Get ready!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took out her Supreme Sacred Artifact, Blackstar Bow, and another Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With this shield, her defense skyrocketed, and she wouldn't be easily defeated or eliminated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And everyone else also took out their Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano and Matthew both possessed Supreme Sacred Artifacts and also held several Legendary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other five also had Legendary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sacred Power began to surge from them, and everyone's expression turned incredibly serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina saw everyone was ready and shouted, "Battle begins!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twinkling Star Arrow, Fifth Arrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twinkle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina made the first move, using her most powerful battle skill, the Twinkling Star Arrow, and it was the Fifth Arrow. The massive arrow shot out, instantly enveloping several warriors' projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A massive explosion erupted, instantly tearing those warriors' projections apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Emiliano, Matthew, and others launched their full-scale attacks. Their strikes also engulfed the warriors' projections, shattering them completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a single attack, they defeated at least ten warriors' projections, but none of them let their guard down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because they knew the most dangerous moment was yet to come. The remaining ninety warriors' projections quickly counterattacked. Ninety terrifying strikes instantly engulfed them, blocking every direction they could dodge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could only defend.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amid the loud noise, screams erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such terrifying attacks were unbearable for the other five. Their defenses were instantly shattered, their bodies torn apart, disappearing into the light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were eliminated!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't even withstand a single attack, but they did buy some time for Seraphina and the others. At this moment, the six launched another attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud bang, another ten warriors' projections were obliterated, most of them killed by Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, they felt no joy, as the remaining eighty warriors' projections charged at them wildly. Watching these agile figures, Seraphina and the others were terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not good. They've become more agile and are even coordinating with each other! Protect me with all your might!" Seraphina shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry! Even if we get eliminated, we'll make sure to buy you enough time!" the other five shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they all gave up attacking and took on the responsibility of defense, buying more time for Seraphina to unleash more attacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twinkling Star Arrow, Sixth Arrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twinkle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twinkling Star Arrow, Seventh Arrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twinkle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina frantically unleashed Sacred Power, controlling the massive Blackstar Bow and continuously firing Twinkling Star Arrows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More and more warriors' projections were slain by Seraphina's arrows, but her face grew increasingly pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Repeatedly using Twinkling Star Arrow, especially the powerful Sixth and Seventh Arrows, she was starting to struggle, even sensing the danger of the Blackstar Bow going out of control.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Must not lose control!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Absolutely not!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina was extremely anxious, and the other five were even more worried as they were about to reach their limit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The combined attacks of dozens of advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors' projections were unstoppable, even with Defensive Sacred Artifacts. Their defenses were shattered again and again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seraphina, hurry up!" Emiliano shouted loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm already trying my best!" Seraphina kept unleashing powerful attacks, taking down the warriors' projections one by one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud bang, Jasmine suddenly couldn't hold on anymore. The attack pierced through her body, eliminating her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her elimination instantly made the defense even harder for the other four.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the second and third screams followed. Yunus and Rosalie couldn't hold on, were struck down by their opponents, and vanished into the light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, only Matthew and Emiliano were left to help Seraphina with the defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And at this moment, they were pale and couldn't hold on much longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seraphina, do you have any trump cards left? If you do, use them now. We can't hold on anymore!" Emiliano shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's expression turned resolute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, nearly half of the warriors' projections remained!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this rate, Emiliano and Matthew would soon be eliminated, leaving only Seraphina, who couldn't clear the level alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I really didn't want to use it!" Seraphina said helplessly. "But now we have no choice! If I don't use this trump card, we definitely can't clear the level! Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina suddenly took out a dazzling bead. An incredibly terrifying energy was swirling within it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is the trump card my father gave me! There's only one, incredibly precious. But as long as it helps me pass the eighteenth level's trial and obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, it will all be worth it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Seraphina frantically poured Sacred Power into the bead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the bead was activated, unleashing a terrifying power. Seraphina unhesitatingly threw it toward the remaining nearly fifty warriors' projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the bead exploded amidst the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A loud bang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying explosion tore everything around it to shreds. Those nearly fifty warriors' projections, even as advanced Empyrean Sacredness, couldn't withstand the blast and were instantly obliterated, vanishing completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Emiliano and Matthew were torn apart by the terrifying explosion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Seraphina quickly dodged to a distance, using a supreme Defensive Sacred Artifact to avoid being obliterated. However, she still coughed up blood wildly, her face pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, she revealed an extremely excited expression and burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She cleared it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina passed the Celestial Spire's eighteenth level trial and finally obtained the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!</span></p></div>
