        <h1>Chapter 2212 I'm on Top</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne truly immersed himself in meditation, he finally realized just how terrifying the Satan's Eye at the Sacredness Level was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Satan's Eye relentlessly dismantled the energy of the Sacred Crystal, its speed so blisteringly fast it felt like a rocket propelling Osborne's cultivation forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just over a year, he soared from Ascension Four to Ascension Six, and yet, to the outside world, only five days had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what was even more remarkable was that Osborne hadn't just reached Ascension Six&mdash;he had already hit its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between Ascension Six and Ascension Seven was immense, but Osborne felt confident that with a few more months of cultivation, he could overcome it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once he reached Ascension Seven, he would face the Ascension Stairway trial for the third time, enduring the Deity King Tribulation once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, if only I could keep cultivating like this forever," Osborne murmured, opening his eyes and deciding to take a break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had he opened them than a tall, graceful figure slipped into his room and nestled into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instinctively wrapped his arms around her slender waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your turn today, huh?" he asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past few months, Isa, Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Anita had been taking turns to keep him company during his breaks from cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And by "keep him company", Osborne meant something far more intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had missed them dearly, and their visits were more than welcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa pouted playfully, saying, "Hmm, so you don't want it to be my turn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I leave and let Clarissa come instead? Or maybe Austin? Emma? Or Annie?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or maybe you think one of me isn't enough and want us all to come together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face flushed instantly. "I didn't mean it like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa burst into a giggle. "Gotcha! But honestly, today wasn't even my turn. It was supposed to be Austin's... but she couldn't handle it, so she asked me to take her place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grinned, her eyes sparkling with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm stronger, so it makes sense for me to step in. After all, someone has to pick up the slack since you've been pushing Austin and the others so hard they're practically scared of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She playfully rolled her eyes at him, and Osborne felt even more embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What </span><span>is</span><span> </span><span>she</span><span> </span><span>talking about?</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span>I've been holding back with Clarissa, Emma, and Austin! But </span><span>their</span><span> </span><span>bodies just can't keep up with mine now that I'm at mid-tier Sacredness Level. Even when I suppress my power, </span><span>they</span><span> </span><span>three at Ascension Seven can't handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Isa, at Ascension Nine, could manage him, though even she ended up begging for mercy in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what Osborne loved most about Isa was her refusal to give up. No matter how desperately she pleaded for mercy one time, she'd be back again soon, eager to challenge him once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a surge of heat through Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled Isa into a tight embrace and flipped her onto her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next second, Isa surged forward with her strength, reversing their positions once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm on top! Otherwise, I'm striking!" she declared stubbornly, her small lips pouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh at her competitiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is all this coming from?" he asked, shaking his head. But as he felt the warmth of her body and the intensity of her affection, he stopped caring about the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, you win. You're on top."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa finally smiled, leaning down to kiss him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, she was moving gracefully above him, her soft moans filling the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, the two lost themselves in the moment, their passion echoing through the space until, finally, Isa whispered her surrender once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa slumped against Osborne's </span><span>chest,</span><span> her exhaustion palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gently stroked her smooth back, feeling her fatigue and pain, a pang of concern tugging at his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you okay?" he asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah!" Isa replied, her voice like a soft purr as she nestled closer, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat. Her face lit up with contentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, she propped herself up, looking at him with earnest eyes. "Osborne, can you take us with you to the Racial Convergence Planet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was filled with a quiet plea, and Osborne hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, I don't want to hide anything from you! This trip to the Racial Convergence Planet involves some serious business, and it's going to be incredibly dangerous. I can't guarantee your safety..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Isa pressed a finger against his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, biting her lip, "I know! But that's exactly why we need to be there with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're not afraid of danger! Besides, you've completely merged with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, right? You've copied our life essence... If something happens to us, you'll bring us back, won't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned upon hearing her words. He said, "But what if I end up in serious </span><span>trouble? The resurrection power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity isn't all-powerful. At this moment, if an Empyrean Sacredness warrior were to take me down, I might not make it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if I can't be resurrected, how on earth can I bring you back? I just can't bear to see you get hurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was dead-serious, while Isa responded with a tender smile that seemed to emit a warm glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, if you're gone for good, what's the meaning of our lives? We're your women! If you die, we wouldn't have the will to live on. It's better that we go together... we can meet again in our next lives, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was caught off guard. He stared at Isa, his heart overflowing with love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How did I get so blessed to have a woman like you by my side? I must have accumulated a ton of good karma in my past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, he quickly flipped her over, pinning her beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! I'll take you to the Racial Convergence Planet, but you have to promise to be a good girl and stay put under me this time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's cheeks turned bright red at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she nodded eagerly, her voice soft and full of earnestness. "Okay! As long as I can be with you, I'd be happy to stay beneath you, even for the rest of my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, love me! But gently!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa threw her arms around him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back any longer, Osborne gave in to their passion, unleashing all the pent-up desire inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finally stopped, Isa was completely spent. With her arms still wrapped around him, she drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was absolutely wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gently stroked her hair, a pang of worry hitting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he realized that being overly powerful wasn't always a good thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I guess I'll just keep on training," he mumbled to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As days went by, Osborne could feel himself edging closer and closer to breaking through to Ascension Seven. And finally, he sensed the approaching barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was all set to ascend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Isa came back, looking dead serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I've got some news about your parents. There's been some development!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But... it's not good news."</span></p></div>
