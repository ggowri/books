        <h1>Chapter 2631 Clearing the Challenge-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne took out the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Next, we need to get the highest reward possible for each level. With the rate of reward increase, if we can achieve the highest reward in every level, by the time we reach the eighteenth floor, we&rsquo;ll be able to exchange battle points for several Supreme Sacred Artifacts!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Clara, Leroy, and Casey's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. Let's give it a try!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll act first, and you support me. You should immediately take down any opponents I haven't defeated."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, as Osborne unleashed a burst of power, the Battle Points Monument instantly glowed red, and countless Sacred Power Arrows had already shot out from Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the next second, the hundred warriors' projections opposite them suddenly shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The four passed the level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara, Leroy, and Casey hadn't even reacted yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than one breath, they accomplished it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hundred warriors' projections at the primary Empyrean Sacredness level on the eleventh floor had all been taken down by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey couldn't help but look at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just gave a faint smile. To him, this was nothing, and he even felt his opponents were too weak, lacking any challenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go. We're heading to the eleventh floor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took less than one breath to deal with a hundred warriors' projections, so they naturally received the highest reward for the tenth-floor trial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of them received ten million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The difficulty of the eleventh floor increased compared to before, but it was still nothing to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He effortlessly defeated those opponents again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, each of them received another ten million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the twelfth floor, they achieved the same result.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Clara, Leroy, and Casey were already a bit numb. They basically didn't need to do anything, as if just following Osborne would easily earn them thirty million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, on the thirteenth floor, the difficulty increased again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the hundred warriors' projections, ten had cultivation levels reaching mid Empyrean Sacredness, while the other ninety were warriors who had just broken through primary Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This level of difficulty made Seraphina and the others take thirty breaths to finally finish the battle, so they only received one-fifth of the maximum reward in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the reward for the thirteenth floor increased tenfold again, with the maximum reward reaching one hundred million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, even if they only got one-fifth of the maximum reward, each of them received twenty million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made everyone in Seraphina's team incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We've reached the thirteenth floor! Only five more floors to go before we reach the eighteenth floor and successfully obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina felt excited and full of anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although the challenges ahead will get tougher, I&rsquo;m confident I can lead everyone to successfully obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, since you&rsquo;re unwilling to team up with me and follow my lead, your group of four will face a full hundred opponents just like us.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It will be very difficult for you to clear the level, so it's even less likely for you to earn high rewards.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I told you, you would regret it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Seraphina finished speaking, she continued leading the team to search for the trial location on the fourteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she wasn&rsquo;t very familiar with the situation on the fourteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The royal family had sent few people to explore the Celestial Spire, and most of them couldn&rsquo;t reach the fourteenth floor, so she had little experience to rely on. She could only search for the trial location on her own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, Seraphina took over an hour to finally find the trial location on the fourteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, they took a full ninety breaths to finally pass the trial, and each of them only received one-tenth of the highest reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had just left when Osborne and the other three arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Their pace is too slow. It seems we can't follow them anymore; it would just be a waste of our time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From the next floor onward, we must find a way to surpass them and arrive before they do. If we reach the eighteenth floor first, we can take the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p></div>
