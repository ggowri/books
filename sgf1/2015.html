        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know what others would do, but I, Osborne, can't just sit back and do nothing! If full-scale war breaks out, I'll lead my people to the battlefield! When that happens, our talents and strengths will still be exposed, and the Paramount Supreme Clan will still target us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do we need to fear exposing our abilities now? Do we need to fear being targeted by the Paramount Supreme Clan? No! We're not afraid at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Full-scale war is inevitable! What I want to do is win as many battles as possible during the competition, so every soldier in the Human Alliance knows that we are no worse than the Unity Clan! And certainly no weaker than the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to restore the morale of the Human Alliance and fill them with the will to fight! Only then will the Human Community have a sliver of hope to endure longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice echoed through the grand hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light stood there, her mouth agape, staring at Osborne in shock. Then, her eyes lit up, radiating an intense brightness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought you'd have a clearer understanding of the situation than I do!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since that's the case, then go all out and do what you must! I can't do much for you, nor do I have anything to reward you with, but I can promise this... If the Paramount Supreme Clan truly comes for you, I'll do everything in my power to ensure your safety!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless Lord Malevolence intervenes personally, no one will harm you! And if he does, he'll have to step over my dead body first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light finished speaking with conviction, and Osborne was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at God of Light, unable to suppress a flicker of emotion in his heart, and nodded at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Then let's work together and give the Paramount Supreme Clan a real shock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow's competition will be the start!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes burned with fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light's eyes blazed with determination as well. "Osborne, you will decide the participants for the Deity Overlord, Deity King, and Ascension One through Four matches! I'll send you the roster later, and you can choose freely! I'll handle the Transcendent Deity and Celestial Deity matches myself. It's time for me to show what I'm truly capable of!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's work together and show those bastards from the Paramount Supreme Clan what we're made of in tomorrow's competition! Let them know the Human Community isn't something to trifle with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, God of Light and Osborne locked eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, both of them felt a sense of familiarity in each other's determined gazes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But neither of them could pinpoint where this familiarity came from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go make preparations!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne excused himself from God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the Sanctum of Light, Osborne gazed out at the vast border. The hundred-billion-strong Human Alliance army was stationed nearby, facing over five hundred billion restless soldiers from the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a sight Osborne had never seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred billion soldiers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If full-scale war breaks out, how many will die? And behind them are trillions of ordinary people. If the Human Community fails to hold back the Dark Deity Legion, they will all perish! They will be enslaved and truly reduced to a state of misery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his jaw tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow's competition must be won! At the very least, we have to show the Human Community that there's hope!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne entered Hope Haven to continue training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the next day arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the third day of the competition. The Human Community had suffered devastating losses in the first two days...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And today, everyone could feel the heavy decline in the Human Community's morale.</span></p></div>
