        <h1>Chapter 2244 Single Strike-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Areli lunged forward and launched a full-on attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela and the Elders of Peak Seven watched from their high platform, their expressions darkening as they witnessed the unfolding events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though cooperation was off-limits in the arena, it was rare for disciples from the same peak to go at each other so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here was Areli, the first one to take a swing at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one said a word, though. In their view, neither Areli nor Osborne stood a real chance of winning the group battle or making it to the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought firmly in their heads, they turned their attention to the other matches going on in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, as Areli came charging at him, Osborne stayed cool as a cucumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sect Tournament allowed the use of weapons, and Areli's attack was no joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Areli was brandishing a divine artifact blade, and it cut through the air with a menacing edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, didn't bat an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He calmly pulled out his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow and got ready. He didn't channel any Sacred Power or use a Divine Ascendance Technique. Instead, he just focused on conjuring an ordinary divine-power arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne steadied his hand, pulled back the bowstring, and let fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The divine-power arrow zipped forward and clashed with Areli's blade energy in a spectacular blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Areli's attack crumbled, and the arrow just kept on coming straight at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Areli's eyes bugged out in shock when he realized his attack had been effortlessly deflected. The arrow was so fast that he didn't have a chance to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was scramble to summon his strength and try to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was all for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without tapping into his Sacred Power or weaving in any Divine Ascendance Techniques, that one shot from Osborne's </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow was way too much for Areli to withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow punched through Areli's defenses, sank deep into his shoulder, and sent him flying off the stage. He hit the ground below with a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Areli was toast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole showdown had happened in the blink of an eye. Meanwhile, the other fighters on the same platform were just starting to lock horns. They were all at the Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King level. With everyone's strength so evenly matched, it'd be no walk in the park to pick a winner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More often than not, the judges would have to step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Sirius Sect had cooked up such a brutal tournament format to speed up the selection of the top twenty and not waste any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here, just seconds into the battle, someone had already been knocked out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unexpected twist caught a lot of people's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining fighters in Group Five exchanged looks, and their expressions turned wary as they eyed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Areli might not have been the top dog, but he was no slouch either. The fact that Osborne had taken him out with a single shot from his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow sent a shiver of unease through the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, though, couldn't have cared less. The arena rules banned </span><span>ganging up</span><span> on one fighter. Since everyone was busy with their own opponents, he couldn't make another move without risking getting disqualified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd have to sit tight until the other fighters had settled their scores before he could jump back into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This whole situation felt like a colossal waste of time to him. In all this dead time, he could've been holed up in seclusion, pushing his skills to the limit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a light bulb went off in Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I can't have multiple attackers go after one person, how about I take on multiple opponents at once?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, he yanked back his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, two divine-power arrows popped into existence, each zeroed in on a couple of fighters still locked in a fierce scrap nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let the bowstring go, and the arrows took off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The color drained from the two combatants' faces when they realized they were both in the crosshairs at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They instantly called a truce in their fight and poured all their energy into defending themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was a lost cause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both arrows smashed through their defenses, sending the fighters crashing off the stage.</span></p></div>
