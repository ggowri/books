        <h1>Chapter 1583 I'll Handle It</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy quickly laid out his plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The plan was simple. Guy would use his position as Laird's brother to figure out where Laird would be. Then, near that spot, Guy, Donald, and Murray would stage a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Guy and Laird were brothers, they looked pretty similar, so Guy could easily pass for Laird. They'd act like they got into a heated argument over something minor, with Donald and Murray ending up badly hurt. They'd make sure to record it all for evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Herman Saxton saw his son and trusted lieutenant both seriously injured by "Laird," there was no doubt he'd react aggressively&mdash;he was fiercely protective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird would try to explain, but it wouldn't do any good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With both witnesses and video proof, Donald and Murray would stick to their story that Laird did it&mdash;no question about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that scenario, Herman wouldn't just let it slide, not if he cared about his son's well-being and the honor of the Saxton family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unless Laird apologized&mdash;which was pretty much impossible given his status&mdash;things would get worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eventually, the conflict between the Saxton and Borden families would spiral out of control. With a bit more pushing, even a clash between the Wild Flame Army and the City Guard was very likely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The best part was, with Donald "injured," he wouldn't be able to get promoted to chiliarch anytime soon, giving Osborne the perfect opportunity to take his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good! Really good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded approvingly at Guy. He wasn't surprised that Guy had risen to be a leader of ten thousand men in the Wild Flame Army&mdash;the guy had real talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, even though you're Laird's brother, your strength is still not at his level, and that shows in your Divine Flames. You both have six blue flames, but Laird's flames are deeper in color, showing his status as a peak Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If anyone really looked closely, they'd notice the difference. So, I'll be the one to impersonate Laird."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne then used his Eclipsing Mantra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His appearance shifted quickly until he looked just like Laird&mdash;right down to the Divine Flames above his head, now five in number, glowing even more brilliantly than Guy's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy stood there, stunned. Osborne's disguise was so flawless that for a second, he almost thought his brother was standing in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow! It's perfect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My lord, even as Laird's own brother, if I hadn't seen you transform with my own eyes, I wouldn't be able to tell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With you pretending to be Laird, no one will suspect a thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly&mdash;naturally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he'd impersonated "Lachlan Swift" for so long, and not a single member of the Swift family had suspected a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Excellent! It's decided, then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Donald, Murray, I'm afraid you'll have to take some hits for this to be convincing. You need to be seriously hurt for maximum effect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald and Murray bowed to Osborne, their voices steady. "Don't worry about us, my lord! As long as we can help you, we'll give our lives without hesitation. Taking a beating is nothing&mdash;please, go ahead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's get started. Guy, find out where Laird will be as soon as possible! We'll make the Saxton and Borden families rip each other apart! We'll make the Wild Flame Army and City Guard clash! We'll throw Wild Flame City into total chaos!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold smile played on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They jumped into action right away. Guy reached out to Laird, using an excuse to chat and figure out where he'd be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tonight, Laird was planning to head to the west side of town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a top leader of the Borden family, Laird's marriage had been all about politics. His wife was from the noble Soaring Lion Clan, and with her backing, Laird had easily become the general of the City Guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Laird didn't have much love for his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He actually had another woman he truly cared about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But because of his wife's powerful family, Laird didn't dare marry his lover, so he bought her a home on the west side of town, where she stayed hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost every few days, Laird would head over there to spend nights with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll do it near there," Osborne said with a cold smile. "Laird's wife is from the Soaring Lion Clan, and he's got a mistress? If we do this near her house, he'll have even more explaining to do! It might even piss off his wife and drag the Soaring Lion Clan into this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt like even fate was on his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he couldn't create chaos between the Borden and Saxton families now, or throw Wild Flame City into turmoil, he might as well quit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We move tonight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued planning with the others, mainly figuring out a valid reason for Donald and Murray to be on the west side of town and to start a fight with "Laird."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To make it believable, they also needed more witnesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they finalized every detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When darkness fell, they moved into action.</span></p></div>
