        <h1>Chapter 2102 The Opportunist's Gain</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Soulreaver Vine sensed it was in trouble, escalating its desperate attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of spiked tendrils lashed out wildly, striking at the members of the two exploration teams surrounding it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every violent thrash, more bodies fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond and Monica's teams had dwindled to fewer than a hundred members, suffering the loss of twenty brave souls in their efforts to bring the Vine down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, most of the remaining fighters were elite guards from the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for their allies from the other clans?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had mostly been sacrificed as disposable pawns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although their numbers had shrunk, the remaining warriors felt no fear. They could sense the Soulreaver Vine's weakening state. After its furious assault, the creature seemed battered, its attacks slowing and </span><span>no longer posing a threat</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! It's weakening! Let's finish it off!" Desmond shouted, his voice filled with exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thundering attacks ensued as nearly a hundred fighters launched a final, furious assault, slashing and smashing the tendrils of the Soulreaver Vine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each attack, the creature writhed, unleashing silent soundwaves that echoed like frantic cries, but it was of no use&mdash;it could do nothing to stop the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, most of the Vine's tendrils were severed, rendering it powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scale of victory was tipping firmly in Desmond and Monica's favor. They both fixed their eager gazes on the scattering Element Gold Crystals around them, hearts racing with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What neither of them noticed, however, was that Osborne and Alfreda had stealthily crept closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes lit up at the sight of the twenty or so gleaming Element Gold Crystals. Excitement coursed through her veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Desmond and Monica!" Alfreda spat, her expression darkening with rage and a desire for vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had come to this perilous Umbra Earth because of Monica's provocations; otherwise, she would still be enjoying her life as a princess in Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alfreda saw Monica now, her old rival triggered a fierce intensity within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially now, as the two exploration teams seemed on the verge of defeating the Soulreaver Vine and claiming the Crystals, Alfreda felt an urgent pang of anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They can't be allowed to snag those Element Gold Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I miss out, they can't get them! Osborne, you stay here while I sabotage their efforts. No matter what, I can't let them finish off the Soulreaver Vine and claim its spoils!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination brimming within her, she began to make her move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" Osborne grabbed her arm, urgency lacing his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the same fury at the sight of Desmond and Monica, remembering all the humiliations he had endured back in Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The decorum expected of him there had forced him to bite his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pent-up frustration Osborne had been holding back was finally ready to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the thrilled faces of Desmond and Monica with a cold smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let them take down the Soulreaver Vine. We'll swoop in and grab the loot! When they're busy collecting those Element Gold Crystals, that'll be their most vulnerable moment. We strike together, steal the Crystals, and then we can deal with them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said confidently, "They're not that strong. There are only a handful of Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings in their ranks, and the rest are Ascension Four! As long as they don't surround me, I can handle them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, glancing at Osborne, concern flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about you? If you're not up for it, just stay hidden and support me from the sidelines. I can take them myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne smiled casually, "You shouldn't be worried about me; you should be focusing on them! Honestly, I think you don't even need to lift a finger. I alone will be more than enough to deal with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda rolled her eyes dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Ascension Two like you being all high and mighty? Let's have a little competition then. How about we see who grabs more Element Gold Crystals and takes down more enemies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that challenge thrown, she shot a teasing look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but burst into laughter. As he eyed Alfreda, who was brimming with self-confidence, a fighting spirit welled up within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He declared, "Alright then! Let's have this showdown! If you win, out of those twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals, I'll only take seven. The rest are yours. But let's get one thing straight right off the bat. You can't off Desmond. He's mine to deal with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes sparkled even brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a beaming smile, she retorted, "You said it yourself! Don't come crying to me later about me taking advantage. I won't kill Desmond; I'll leave him for you. But you're off limits when it comes to Monica! I can't wait to take her down myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick agreement, Osborne and Alfreda turned their attention back to the chaos ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Soulreaver Vine was nearing its end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of its thorny tendrils had been severed, leaving it without its primary means of attack. Its slow movements rendered it incapable of escaping. Facing nearly a hundred Ascension Four and Ascension Five opponents, it had no chance left&mdash;death was imminent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finish it off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's bring it down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shouts of the two exploration teams filled the air as fervor bubbled among them. Though they wouldn't be able to claim even one crystal for themselves, they knew the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family would generously reward their efforts when they returned to Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waves of furious attacks surged, washing over the Soulreaver Vine like a tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It let out a silent wail of unwillingness, finally collapsing with a heavy thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Soulreaver Vine, comparable to an Ascension Six being, was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the creature fell, the elite warriors of the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family let out a collective sigh of relief, exhaustedly sinking to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relentless pressure of the battle had drained them, and now with the Vine defeated, they could finally relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond and Monica, standing at a distance, watched the moment unfold, their excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exclaimed, "Woohoo!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's finally dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those Element Gold Crystals are ours! Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having commanded from afar while avoiding direct involvement in the fighting, Desmond and Monica sprang into action, racing toward the scattered Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're ours for the taking!" Both of them sparkled with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, two figures zipped past them, moving faster than they could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne and Alfreda!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the Soulreaver Vine went down, the hidden duo leaped into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let the contest begin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm going to snag more Element Gold Crystals than you and take down more enemies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be the winner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's voice echoed in his mind as she shot forward, her speed as an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King leaving Osborne behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply smiled, "Not so fast! You might find that when it comes to snatching things, you're no match for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he tapped into his spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he vanished from his spot, reappearing right in front of Alfreda, landing near a shimmering Element Gold Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick motion, he snatched it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without skipping a beat, he disappeared again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne darted from place to place, rapidly collecting the scattered Element Gold Crystals with his uncanny speed.</span></p></div>
