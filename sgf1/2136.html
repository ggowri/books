        <h1>Chapter 2125 Radiant Golden Ore-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of incredulity washed over Alfreda's face as she turned to Osborne, unable to comprehend the treasure he had casually handed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each Element Gold Crystal was worth more than an average Apex divine artifact, possibly even more. As a princess of the Nature Elf Clan's Royal Family, Alfreda had never laid eyes on such a substantial collection of Element Gold Crystals in her life&mdash;not even a fraction of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, even her father likely hadn't encountered this many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, here was Osborne, casually handing her three hundred of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on what he said, these three hundred crystals were just one-tenth of all the Element Gold Crystals his Spatial Clones had harvested in the Death Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, that meant his clones must have collected a staggering three thousand Element Gold Crystals in total!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda inhaled sharply, her heart swelling with gratitude and emotion as she looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was more generous than anyone she had ever known!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three hundred Element Gold Crystals were just given away without a second thought!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly, Osborne could have kept every single one of those crystals to himself, and Alfreda wouldn't have batted an eye. After all, these Element Gold Crystals had nothing to do with her; she hadn't lifted a finger to earn them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't mentioned it, she would never have known he had such a trove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, deciding to give her three hundred Element Gold Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, his actions showed tremendous trust in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If word got out that Osborne had three thousand of those crystals, the entire Elf City would erupt into chaos, with everyone clamoring to hunt him down and seize his treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he chose to confide in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda bit her lip, her voice wavering with emotion as she expressed her gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, thank you! I promise I won't say a word!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, waving his hand dismissively. "Don't bother me right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he pulled out a pale golden crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "What is this? There's no record of it in the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings! The closest match I see is the Cosmic Chaos Gold Crystal.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The Cosmic Chaos Gold Crystal is said to be a treasure of the universe, formed in the chaos before the cosmos itself came into being and scattered across the universe in the aftermath of the Big Bang. And it's incredibly rare.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Even Prince Chuck doesn</span><span>'t know what it is for. In fact, even an Empyrean Sacredness warrior would fight tooth and nail for a piece of Cosmic Chaos Gold Crystal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne examined the pale golden crystal again&mdash;it bore a resemblance to the Cosmic Chaos Gold Crystal but contained minuscule energy far beneath what its name implied. So, it couldn't possibly qualify as one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to ponder as he flipped through the Compendium, trawling for answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a thorough review&mdash;three times, no less&mdash;he grew frustrated at not finding an exact match and decided to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever this is, if it can catch the interest of Satan's Eye, it has to be valuable. I'll name you... Radiant Golden Ore! Maybe this Radiant Golden Ore can truly enhance my Satan's Eye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arriving on this Umbra Earth continent, Osborne felt his Satan's Eye was heavily suppressed, depriving him of its full advantages. If it could become even more powerful, retrieving treasures here would be a breeze!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, he decided to give it a go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do I even use this Radiant Golden Ore, though?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed the Radiant Golden Ore against his Satan's Eye, but to his dismay, it triggered no reaction. The Satan's Eye pulsed excitedly, but it couldn't absorb the energy contained within the ore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I need to break down the energy within the Radiant Golden Ore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a moment of inspiration, Osborne tried to wrap the Radiant Golden Ore in Sacred Power, attempting to dissolve its energy just as he had done with the Azure Ore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, nothing happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a massive eye-figure materialized before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Infinite Devouring Eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, the Infinite Devouring Eyes had emerged on its own, without any control from him.</span></p></div>
