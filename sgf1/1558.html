        <h1>Chapter 1557 Striking Fear</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne's command echoing in the air, Darren and his allies intensified their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to their credit, Fabian and Gilbert were indeed Deity Overlord warriors. Even though they were completely overwhelmed by Darren, it wasn't easy to kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as all the members of the Wolfe family and the Keynes family were killed, and dozens of Celestial Deity warriors joined the assault on them, they finally could no longer hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gilbert was the first to crumble. Lacking the robust defenses of Fabian, he was caught off guard by Darren, who shattered his Divine Body with a single blow. He collapsed to the ground like a discarded rag doll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gasped, fury in his eyes, "Spark of Blaze, you won't get away with this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Crimson Ironhoof Clan will avenge me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before he could finish his threat, Darren's divine power sliced through the air, severing his head from his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The last echoes of Gilbert's rage faded into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next was Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though he was tough and resilient, his defenses were no match for Darren's overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Spark of Blaze, the Wild Bull Clan won't let this slide! They will seek retribution!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But with a swift motion, Fabian's head joined Gilbert's on the ground, the fight coming to an abrupt halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air thickened with the stench of blood, spreading out to the onlookers from various factions who stood frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't believe their eyes. Two Deity Overlord warriors had been killed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in Celestara, Deity Overlords were considered super warriors, each capable of leading a third-tier or even a second-tier faction. Even in the top-tier powers, Deity Overlords were rare, each one a pillar of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet here they were, two Deity Overlords, taken down by Spark of Blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Wolfe and Keynes families, once third-tier powers, had been utterly annihilated, their top warriors wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From this point on, Wild Flame City would likely be rid of the Wolfe and Keynes families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow! What a brutal display!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd's expressions grew grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One observer said with disbelief etched on his face, "For over a century, no Human Community force has dared to wipe out a major clan! And now, Spark of Blaze&mdash;a faction barely days old&mdash;has taken down two major powers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're ruthless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't they fear the wrath of the clans? A massacre of the Human Community within Wild Flame City, or even across the East Zone, could be on the horizon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But deep down, he knew that such a scenario was highly unlikely. After all, for another large-scale massacre in the Human Community to occur, it would require the approval of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ninth Dark Deity Legion was currently preoccupied with supporting the West Zone, combating the Human Community resistance organizations there. Another part of the legion was busy developing Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It would be unreasonable to expect the Ninth Dark Deity Legion to launch another major massacre in the East Zone just because the Spark of Blaze wiped out the Wolfe family and the Keynes family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Wolfe family and the Keynes family simply did not have that much influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, it was them who had attacked Spark of Blaze first. This was merely a retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calvin's voice rang out, cold and critical. "Humph! They are seeking death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As a faction of the Human Community, they're acting so brazenly, leaving no room for retreat. They're digging their own graves! The Wild Bull Clan and Crimson Ironhoof Clan won't let this go without a response. They will retaliate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A Human Community faction should develop quietly, avoiding unnecessary conflicts with major clans. Look at us, the Swift family&mdash;we've thrived in Wild Flame City precisely because we know how to be patient!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The more aggressive you are, the more you'll be pushed down! The stronger you appear, the quicker you'll meet your end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't be fooled by Spark of Blaze's current bravado. Sure, they've taken out the Wolfe family and the Keynes family, striking fear into the hearts of the major clans, but it won't be long before someone comes to take care of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They won't last long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Calvin's icy gaze was fixed on Osborne, his frustration palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd overheard others murmuring that from now on, the premier faction of the Human Community in Wild Flame City would no longer be the Swift family but Spark of Blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! How can a reckless group like Spark of Blaze even begin to compare to the Swift family? I just became the head of the Swift family, and now we're losing our status as the top faction in the Human Community?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Curse that traitor Lachlan!" Calvin seethed, blaming Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as he glanced at Darren and the twenty or so masked Celestial Deity warriors surrounding Osborne, he thought better of voicing his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Someone will deal with you!" he growled before turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as he tried to push past, two figures suddenly appeared in his path&mdash;Osborne and Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne regarded Calvin with a mocking smile, his voice cold and devoid of warmth. "The head of the Swift family, in such a hurry to leave? It seems we still have some matters to discuss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calvin's expression hardened, a flicker of anxiety crossing his face. "Lachlan, what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's contempt was clear. "Shouldn't that be my question? You and your fellow heirs of the Swift family declared a bounty on my head, accusing me of stealing a load of Essence Crystals and treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You even demanded that I return everything to the Swift family within three days! Isn't that right?"</span></p></div>
