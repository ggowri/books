        <h1>Chapter 667 Vincent's Anger</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I just make it to the first place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During these ten days, he had been hiding underground to improve himself and hadn't participated in any battles. As a result, his points hardly increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the other five potential heirs, they had been fighting against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> during this time. Although they suffered some losses, they managed to kill some great fighters from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> and gradually increase their points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Vincent, Matthew, and Emma, their points were almost constantly increasing, and by now, they had already reached around one thousand points each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Owen's points were no longer negative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne's points had always been at negative two thousand, making him at the absolute bottom of the rankings, even lower than Lance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Osborne killing five Class AAA opponents, instantly gaining five thousand points, his points skyrocketed to first place, far surpassing the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this battle were to end now, I would become the first heir of the Augustine family, completing the sixth test set by the Godfather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, this war won't end so soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After muttering these words, Osborne turned off the Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he did not know that at this moment, his five rivals were all stunned as they looked at the rankings and points on the scoreboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three thousand points? Did you say he instantly increased by five thousand points? Jumping from last place to first place on the scoreboard?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leading me by a full two thousand points?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the headquarters of Draco Group in </span><span>Tyrisland</span><span>, Vincent's face was incredibly gloomy and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fist, and everyone present could feel his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne cheated, didn't he? Otherwise, how could he suddenly gain five thousand points? Don't tell me he killed five Class AAA opponents from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> in one go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that possible? Even if all of us joined forces, it would be difficult to kill just one! Let alone five!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was extremely furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, he had always been the strongest among the younger generation of the Augustine family, far surpassing everyone else. He was the first to break through to the Class AAA and the only one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always been confident, believing that he would quickly become the first place in the selection of heirs, leaving the second place far behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, reality gave him a huge slap in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did his points not surpass Matthew's, but he also couldn't even surpass Emma's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Osborne was leading him by two thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I refuse to accept this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne must have cheated! I need to contact the Godfather. I demand an explanation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to contact him; I've already confirmed it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a senior with a cane walked over. He was Declan Augustine, the elder patriarch of the Augustine family and Vincent's grandfather. He was the oldest member of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decades ago, if it weren't for the Godfather's sudden emergence, establishing the Draco Group, and defeating the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, Declan would have been the head of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Declan deeply respected and admired the Godfather, the current head of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the Godfather, the Augustine family became the oldest and most prestigious ancient family in the </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Declan were the head of the Augustine family, they wouldn't have the current glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, you've already asked?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent looked solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan nodded. "Yes, I have. Osborne didn't cheat. He did make five thousand points. His team indeed killed five Class AAA fighters from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>! However, I don't know how his team managed to do it, as the Godfather didn't disclose any further information."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan's words left Vincent dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They killed five Class AAA fighters from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>? And all at once? Is that even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan's face became grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also think it's unlikely, but that's the truth! Perhaps Osborne found powerful external support. Either way, this matter has been confirmed. Osborne didn't cheat, and his points are valid. There is no problem with his ranking on the scoreboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What you need to do now isn't to ponder how he did it, but to consider what we should do next to secure second place or catch up and become first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are Vincent, the strongest among the younger generation of the Augustine family. You should strive for first place on the scoreboard! Even if you can't get first due to unexpected circumstances, you must definitely hold onto second place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let me down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Declan patted Vincent's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's expression changed constantly, and after a long while, he finally regained control of his emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You killed five Class AAA opponents?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can do it, then I, Vincent, can do it too, and I can do it better! It seems I've been too cautious before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought by playing it safe, I would definitely secure the first place. Now, I need to reveal some of my true strength, and I will catch up! I will make all of you know that I am the strongest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After muttering these words, Vincent looked determined and ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, let's have a meeting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've decided. We will launch a counterattack against the rare metal mining area occupied by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!"</span></p></div>
