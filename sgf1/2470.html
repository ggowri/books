        <h1>Chapter 2376 Departure-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who came to join the Mystic Sirius Sect all wanted to join Peak Seven and become Osborne's fellow disciples.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne appeared, the crowd erupted into enthusiastic cheers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone in the Mystic Sirius Sect looked at him with admiration and fervent eyes, seeing him as an idol and a goal, taking pride in him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the sect leader of Mystic Sirius Sect, Lenny, invited Osborne to the stage to say a few words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne did not decline, casually said a few words, and gave a brief encouragement to everyone. After some commotion, Osborne finally boarded the Mystic Sirius Sect's battleship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the battleship, besides Lenny, there was also Peak One's Peak Lord Danilo.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lenny ordered, "Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was not a man of many words; he simply nodded at Osborne, then started the battleship and headed toward Tempest Fortress City's translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, the Eastern Zone 3 zone duel is being held in Crescentia, </span><span>Wascod</span><span> State, which is very far from Zephyr State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and the others</span><span> first need to use Tempest Fortress City's translocator to travel to </span><span>Zephyrville</span><span> in </span><span>Wascod</span><span> State, then transfer to another translocator to reach Crescentia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zephyrville</span><span> is the </span><span>biggest</span><span> city in </span><span>Wascod</span><span> State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone heading to Crescentia to watch the match must first go to </span><span>Zephyrville</span><span>. At that time, </span><span>Zephyrville's</span><span> translocator might be in high demand, requiring people to queue up for use.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, </span><span>Osborne and the others</span><span> set off five days in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, if he fails to reach Crescentia on time, he will lose his eligibility to compete.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne couldn't care less about all this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Angela was absent, Osborne didn't want to say much and left everything to Sect Leader Lenny to arrange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, they arrived at Tempest Fortress City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you finally made it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the translocator of Tempest Fortress City, two familiar figures appeared. It was Clara and Leroy. They smiled and greeted Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, they had been waiting there for Osborne's arrival.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the state duel, it was Osborne who shared points with them, bringing them into the top ten. Without Osborne's help, they wouldn't have had a chance to participate in the zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sects behind them, Fantasia Isle and Azure Haven Academy, were also very grateful to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and greeted them. "Let's head out together!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The group entered the translocator and soon appeared in </span><span>Zephyrville</span><span> of </span><span>Wascod</span><span> State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he stepped out of the translocator, Osborne felt the dense crowd and the incredibly lively atmosphere of </span><span>Zephyrville</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people had come from various parts of Eastern Zone 3, preparing to head to Crescentia to watch the match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's find a place to rest first! We've already booked a translocator to Crescentia, but the earliest slot is the day after tomorrow. So, we'll need to stay in </span><span>Zephyrville</span><span> for two days," Lenny said, then led Osborne and the others to a lodging.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's accommodation was a standalone small courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just after settling in, the courtyard door was knocked on&mdash;it was Clara and Leroy coming to visit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After they entered the house, their faces were full of surprise as they looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara exclaimed in surprise, "Osborne, it's only been a little over two months, but you seem completely different from before! Standing before us now, even without any energy fluctuations, you make us feel as if we're facing an unfathomable abyss!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy also asked, "Have your abilities improved again?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly after hearing this, also sizing them up, and said, "You two have improved quite a bit as well. Clara, you must have mastered the Sacred Artifact by now, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara immediately nodded proudly upon hearing this. "I made it into the top ten in the state duel, and the elders of Fantasia Isle were so pleased that they took me to the sect's treasury to choose freely! I picked two Sacred Artifacts that suit me perfectly and spent over two months fully mastering them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy also smiled and said, "It's pretty much the same for me. After making it into the top ten in the state duel, Azure Haven Academy rewarded me with a Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's mouth twitched slightly after hearing this.</span></p></div>
