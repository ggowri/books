        <h1>Chapter 2251 Streak-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for the compliment, Mr. Wilkens. I'll do my best," Osborne replied calmly before stepping off the arena, ready to make way for the next match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Vadim not provoked him, Osborne likely would have just defeated him without inflicting such severe injuries. After all, with Vadim's skill, he could still have competed for second place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second place came with rewards too, not just from the sect but also ninety Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each point could at least be exchanged for a Sacred Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't sound like much at first glance, but the real prize was the chance to continue in the city duel. Given Vadim's abilities, he had a solid shot at breaking into the top ten, which could net him thousands of Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>&mdash;a fortune by any measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, with Vadim severely injured, he had lost his chance at the top ten and wouldn't be able to participate in the upcoming city duel at Tempest Fortress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The losses were substantial. Osborne knew that once Vadim woke up, he would undoubtedly harbor hatred towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Vadim's standing, he would likely make things difficult for Osborne within the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't have cared less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sole reason for joining the Mystic Sirius Sect was to secure a legitimate identity. Once the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel was over, he'd likely move on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Vadim wouldn't stand a chance of getting revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne had no qualms about what he'd done to Vadim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lived by a straightforward code&mdash;he didn't go looking for trouble, but he wasn't one to back down from it either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up for the second match, a contestant from Peak Six..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tournament rolled on. Osborne watched for a while, but his interest quickly waned. The fighters were no match for Vadim; they were at least a couple of skill levels below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing he could glean from their battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of wasting his time, he'd rather head back and train to beef up his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly, Osborne had at least five or six more matches to sit through today. He couldn't just leave, so he shut his eyes and slipped into a quiet meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, it was time for Osborne's second match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, his opponent was a core disciple from Peak Four. Osborne didn't mess around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he set foot on the stage, he whipped out his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow and channeled his Sacred Power into an arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disciple from Peak Four tried to put up a fight, but he didn't stand a chance against even one of Osborne's arrows. He pushed himself to the max, but he couldn't break through the might of Osborne's Sacred-Power-infused arrow. His defenses crumbled like a house of cards, and there was no way for him to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, a single arrow laid him low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this time, Osborne reined in his power. Osborne made sure he only defeated his opponent, leaving him with just a minor scratch that wouldn't stop him from fighting in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disciple stood up, his expression a mix of respect and confusion as he looked at Osborne. Finally, he bowed slightly. "Thank you for the lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. This was a core disciple, and he was just an inner disciple; normally, respect should flow the other way. But clearly, he had earned the respect of everyone through his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and stepped off the stage without further comment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the day, Osborne faced no significant challenges. Even in his third match, he took down his opponent with another arrow. From his fourth match onward, every opponent chose to surrender immediately.</span></p></div>
