        <h1>Chapter 2622 Celestial Spire-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina arrogantly smiled and said, "The royal family's methods are beyond your imagination. I admit I lost to Osborne in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, I wasn't his match!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But after we enter the Celestial Spire, I will reach mid Empyrean Sacredness, while he can at most break through to primary Empyrean Sacredness. With such a gap in cultivation level, what can he use to compete with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My strength is the greatest, so of course, I will be the leader!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina finished speaking and looked at Osborne provocatively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile, too lazy to pay her any attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy retorted unwillingly, "So what if you can break through to mid Empyrean Sacredness? Everyone, don't forget she's a royal princess. The royal family hid information from us and didn't inform us in advance about the situation in Necropolis City, which led to such heavy casualties!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you sure you want her to lead us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm worried she'll get us killed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Leroy finished speaking, everyone's expressions turned serious as they began to think carefully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Seraphina extremely angry, and she glared fiercely at Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gritted her teeth and said, "What happened before was just an accident. The royal family didn't deliberately hide anything. The truth is, it was a serious matter, and we couldn't tell you in advance. Besides, the royal family's losses were far greater than yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you think my father deliberately wanted to get us killed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Seraphina finished speaking, everyone nodded, feeling that she made a good point.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, I won't accept you as the leader!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I only listen to Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy looked determined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, stop arguing. The Spirit-Entombing Fragrance outside is getting stronger. We'd better enter the Celestial Spire first. Let's talk after we break through to a new cultivation level!" someone said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina thought for a moment, nodded, and said, "Alright! We should enter the Celestial Spire first. After everyone breaks through to a new cultivation level, we&rsquo;ll decide who will be the leader!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she took the lead and walked into the Celestial Spire, and the others quickly followed her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and, along with Leroy and Clara, stayed at the back before finally entering the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive door of the Celestial Spire in front of them cast a beam of light, scanning their bodies. Then, the enormous door transformed into a soft water curtain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone walked in effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone felt a slight dizziness. Then, they entered the interior of the Celestial Spire. It was an extremely dim world, surrounded by thick fog, appearing incredibly quiet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, it's safe here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina said, "The royal family once sent people to the Celestial Spire, so I&rsquo;m quite familiar with its first few levels."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's temporarily safe here. We can break through to a new cultivation level here. The trials in the Celestial Spire are extremely challenging. We must reach Empyrean Sacredness and work together to have a chance of passing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, let's each break through to a new cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Seraphina finished speaking, she sat cross-legged on her own. The power around her began to surge and erupt wildly, and her aura grew stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She is breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other five princes and princesses also sat cross-legged like Seraphina and began breaking through to a new cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, everyone exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like it's not that dangerous here. Let's quickly break through to a new cultivation level! Only by reaching Empyrean Sacredness can we be safer!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, almost everyone sat cross-legged and began breaking through to a new cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "Let's break through to a new cultivation level first! Once we reach Empyrean Sacredness, we'll look at other situations."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy nodded and immediately sat cross-legged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also sat cross-legged, excitement flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had suppressed his cultivation level for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he could finally break through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was finally about to reach Empyrean Sacredness, and his strength could continue to improve.</span></p></div>
