        <h1>Chapter 2232 Angela's Shock-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this show on the road!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening bang, the battle kicked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's ace in the hole was her soul-based attacks, but when going up against the soulless Wooden Golem, her skills seemed to hit a wall. Add to that the Golem's cultivation level at Ascension Six, and right from the get-go, she was on the back foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela watched the unfolding scene and couldn't help but shake her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's performance had already caught her eye. In the past, she would've been over the moon and itching to take Zoe on as a private disciple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Anastasia setting such a high standard, Zoe seemed to fade into the background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, Angela was well aware that her time and energy were limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking on too many disciples would only cramp her style when it came to teaching them properly, and in the end, it'd be a raw deal for Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the fight wore on, Angela's expression started to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her amazement, Zoe didn't go down in defeat against the Ascension Six Wooden Golem. Instead, after sizing up its strength, she slowly but surely started to turn the tables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Zoe came out on top, having knocked out the Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela couldn't hold back a gasp, her heart pounding. Another prodigy who could leap three cultivation levels and take down her Golem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the surprises just kept on coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila, Kendra, Bryce, Diana, and Hannah all took their turns. Even though each of them took a different amount of time, they too managed to defeat the Ascension Six Wooden Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this point, Angela was completely </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at the seven of them, her eyes a blend of admiration and inner turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their talent was out of this world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the old days, just one of them would have made Angela's pulse race, and she'd have been all over the chance to take them under her wing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, her time and energy were in short supply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way she could promise to mentor seven disciples effectively&mdash;five, or even four, would be pushing it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Angela could take all seven on, but she knew that'd mean she couldn't give them the guidance they truly needed. That'd be a total waste of their potential, and she couldn't afford to be that reckless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bittersweet feeling of elation washed over Angela.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that running into so many gifted folks all at once made the decision-making process a real pain in the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen, what's your take on this?" Osborne asked, a smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela didn't answer right away. Instead, she shifted her gaze to Clarissa, Emma, Austin, Anita, and Isa. "How about you guys? Up for a try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could jump in, Clarissa and the others shook their heads. "No thanks. There's no way we can go up against a Wooden Golem three cultivation levels above us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela couldn't help but let out a little laugh at their reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an Empyrean Sacredness warrior, she could easily tell their cultivation levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Anita had all reached Ascension Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three levels higher than that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant going up against an Empyrean Sacredness Golem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was zero chance they could pull that off. If they could, Angela wouldn't even be thinking about taking on disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing that they weren't keen on becoming her students, she didn't push it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Angela turned her attention to Anastasia and the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she gritted her teeth and announced, "You seven are something else! Seriously! I can't believe you're all from a small life-bearing planet! In the whole Mystic Sirius Sect... </span><span>no</span><span>, in the entire Tempest Fortress City, there are probably only a few with talent that can hold a candle to yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd love to take you all on as my personal disciples and pass on everything I've learned in my life! But unfortunately, I don't have the time or energy to guide all of you properly. Trying to take you all on would just squander your potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'll only take..."</span></p></div>
