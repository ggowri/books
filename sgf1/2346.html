        <h1>Chapter 2282 State Duel Rules-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first three days of the state duel were all about token-hunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more tokens one found and the more points one racked up, the higher his standing would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But merely finding tokens wasn't going to cut it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real game-changer was on the fourth day. That was when the stealing spree kicked off! Participants were free to snatch tokens from other participants. If one couldn't defend his own tokens, well, that was just tough luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stealing phase would go on for a solid four days!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After those four days, everyone had to head back to the submission point with the tokens they had in their possession, and that was when the final rankings would be determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, the state duel would stretch over a full seven days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first three days were for token-gathering, and the last four were for token-stealing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had Satan's Eye, which would undoubtedly give him a huge edge in finding tokens. He was bound to scoop up a whole bunch of tokens and amass a ton of points in the first three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But come the fourth day, others would be chomping at the bit to steal his tokens. That was when Osborne's mettle would truly be put to the test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real challenge was how to safeguard his own tokens and even pilfer from his opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The competition is going to be a bloodbath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This state duel is going to be way more intense and cut-throat than the city duel. If you're not up to the mark, it'll be next to impossible to shine under these rules."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela furrowed her brow. "You bet! That's why I'm telling you to form a team. You raked in over a million Sacred Crystals from the casino during the city duel. If you're willing to part with some of it, you can surely persuade some powerful warriors to have your back. That way, you might just stand a chance of making it into the top ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen, making it into the top ten in this duel nets you at least one hundred thousand in Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. Ninth place rakes in two hundred thousand! If you're in luck, you'll not only recoup your investment but also turn a nice profit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela began another attempt to convince Osborne to team up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply flashed a smile and shook his head. "Nah, I'm good. Let things unfold as they will. I'm not interested in a top-ten finish bought with cash. Even if I manage to squeeze into the top ten here, I'll be a fish out of water in the zone duel and get knocked out in a jiffy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My sights are set on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This state duel is just small fry. I want to prove myself with my own skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was left speechless once again by Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, you've got some big dreams! Okay, I give up. Do what you think is best. The state duel kicks off in three days. Get yourself ready. We're heading to Frost Peak City tomorrow morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll take a two-day break in Frost Peak City, and then the state duel begins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a nod. "Sure thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne finally took his leave from Angela's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela watched his retreating back and shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne's got way too much confidence. His aim is to take part in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel... I never even got the chance to compete in it back in the day. I was knocked out in the final round of the zone duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Everyone who gets to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel is a bona-fide super genius with incredible talent. And they also need to have a powerful background and connections. Otherwise, it's a pipe dream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh well, maybe he'll come to his senses once the state duel gets underway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shook her head and put the thought out of her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne strolled around the Mystic Sirius Sect. Wherever he went, the sect's disciples would immediately swarm around him, their faces beaming with excitement and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even took the bold step of confessing their love to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was so taken aback that he hightailed it back to his quarters. However, he didn't resume his secluded cultivation. He'd been pushing himself too hard recently and needed some time to unwind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he was set to head to Frost Peak City the next day, so there was no point in shutting himself away for cultivation as he wouldn't make any significant progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne's communicator suddenly buzzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a quick look and saw that it was Clara calling. He promptly picked up the phone.</span></p></div>
