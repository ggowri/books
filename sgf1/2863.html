        <h1>Chapter 2708 Temporary Solution</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?! How could this happen?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes instantly turned red upon hearing this. He tightly grabbed Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could actually feel Alfreda's condition deteriorating rapidly, even using the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity couldn't stop the process.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Alfreda might not hold on for much longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he refused to accept this reality!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Primordial said it, he couldn't accept it. He glared at Primordial angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, don't do this!" Alfreda said, "Primordial is just telling the truth. Don't take it out on him, he's not wrong! Let him go..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth and finally let go of Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a deep breath, calmed down, and gently said to Alfreda, "Alfreda, don't worry, I won't let you die! I have the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, the power to bring you back to life. Even if I have to revive you ten thousand times, I won't give up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda managed to give Osborne a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I believe in you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial sighed, "It's useless! No matter how many times you revive Alfreda, as long as the problem with the Elven Mother Tree remains unresolved, Alfreda will soon die again, enduring the pain of death once more!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You know better than I do that the resurrection power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is neither invincible nor infinite! Every time you revive Alfreda, her life essence becomes more fragile. If you revive her a hundred times, a thousand times, or ten thousand times... her life essence will be incomplete. She will not only lose many things but also, due to the essence being too fragmented, be unable to revive again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's words left Osborne silent. He clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew all of this, but he was completely helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne regretted deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry, Alfreda! It's all my fault. I should have come with you to Elf City! I caused this. If I had come with you, none of this would have happened!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with tears, overwhelmed with guilt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Alfreda felt heartbroken and quickly said, "Osborne, it's not your fault! It has nothing to do with you! If anyone's to blame, it's me! I could have waited a few more days to return to Elf City, but I insisted on coming back immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't blame yourself. Maybe this is just my fate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda sighed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her breath kept weakening. Her vital essence was fading away. More blood trickled from the corner of her mouth. This wasn't her fault, but the Elven Mother Tree she had merged with was withering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without the Fountain of Life, the Elven Mother Tree would surely die, and so would Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next time, even if Osborne revives Alfreda, she might not regain consciousness and could quickly wither and die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists. Looking at Alfreda, he was still blaming himself. This could have been avoided! All of this could have been avoided. It was all his arrogance, thinking Elf City posed no danger, so he only let Isa and Clarissa accompany Alfreda here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he didn&rsquo;t come personally, he felt he should have let May come along or had Weston, whom he controlled, accompany them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that were the case, this problem wouldn't have happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt immense guilt, but he knew blaming himself now wouldn't save Alfreda's rapidly fading life. The most important thing now was to quickly find a solution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at Primordial and gritted his teeth, "There's one more place that might have the Fountain of Life. That's the Celestial Spire in Necropolis City! Within the Celestial Spire, even Primordial Energy can be exchanged, so the Fountain of Life must be there too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial frowned and said, "That's not certain!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial Energy and the Fountain of Life are treasures of the same level, but that doesn't mean having Primordial Energy in the Celestial Spire guarantees the presence of the Fountain of Life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"More importantly, even if the Celestial Spire has the Fountain of Life, can you get it? The guardian of the Celestial Spire said exchanging for Primordial Energy requires ten billion medals! You'd need to reach at least the seventy-second floor, or even the eighty-first floor, to make it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And with your current strength, forget about reaching the seventy-second floor... you can't even make it to the thirty-sixth floor! You're far too weak!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, don't pin your hopes on the Celestial Spire!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened immediately upon hearing this, "Then what else can be done?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget about obtaining the Fountain of Life anytime soon!" Primordial continued, "Saving Alfreda and fully restoring her is impossible! What&rsquo;s most important now is figuring out how to stabilize Alfreda's condition and stop it from worsening!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This way, you'll have enough time to search for the Fountain of Life! Whether it's venturing deeper into the universe or exchanging for it in the Celestial Spire, both will take time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time is indeed the most crucial thing for him right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I must stabilize Alfreda's condition, stop it from worsening, or at least prevent her from dying too quickly. Only then is there hope!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But how should I do it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone present was thinking quickly&mdash;Isa, Clarissa, and Primordial, even Alfreda, were all frowning in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne came up with an idea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, you said the Elven Mother Tree's problem is the loss of essence? Then, if we can stop its essence from leaking, Alfreda's condition won't worsen, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said, "Of course! But the question is, how will you stop the Elven Mother Tree's essence from leaking?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial continued with a serious expression, "If it were that easy, I wouldn't be so troubled! There's nothing in my memory that can help! At least, nothing that can be used right now..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and said, "What about the Domain Suppression Stele? Once activated, it can stop the energy flow in an area! After activation, the Domain Suppression Stele can halt all energy circulation in a region! The Elven Mother Tree's essence is a type of energy too, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can we use the Domain Suppression Stele to suppress the Elven Mother Tree's essence? If her essence can't circulate, it naturally won't leak out..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Primordial's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This method has a real chance of success! Don't waste any more time, try it immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more the Elven Mother Tree's essence leaked, the worse Alfreda's condition became. He immediately took out the Domain Suppression Stele and activated it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the power of the Domain Suppression Stele erupted, enveloping Alfreda's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, both expectant and worried, carefully sensed Alfreda's condition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, a look of joy appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's body was no longer deteriorating, or rather, the deterioration had slowed down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leakage of the Elven Mother Tree's essence in her body was suppressed by the Domain Suppression Stele, no longer draining uncontrollably, which also prevented the Elven Mother Tree from withering rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this suppression is not complete!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial frowned and said, "The Domain Suppression Stele has an effect! But its power isn't strong enough, after all, it's just a Supreme Sacred Artifact, not even an Imperial Artifact. It can't completely suppress the essence of the Elven Mother Tree! Although the leakage has slowed significantly, if the Elven Mother Tree can't be fully healed, its essence will eventually run out and wither. This process might only take ten years!"</span></p></div>
