        <h1>Chapter 1972 Against an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram locked eyes with Osborne, startled by the sudden appearance of this new player.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up until now, all his focus had been on Jethro's impending self-destruction, and he hadn't noticed Osborne's arrival at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with a stranger standing before him, tension coursed through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! The fact that I killed Jethro cannot get out. No one can know I'm still alive! This guy has to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought racing through his mind, Bram shoved a white Miracle Elixir into Trevor's hands and tossed him aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze turned icy as he fixed it on Osborne, the murderous intent clear in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?" Bram asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had reverted to his original appearance, so Bram remained unaware that Osborne was the "Theodore" he had been searching for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, for his part, had no intention of enlightening Bram about this fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he retorted, "So you're part of the Baxter family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't realize the Baxter family was hiding an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King! But you killed my grandfather, and for that, you all deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice dripped with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram couldn't help but chuckle at the revelation, "So you're Jethro's grandson! Hilarious! I never would've guessed the Hudson family had such a prodigy hidden away. An Ascension One Supernal Deity King at your age? You must be their secret weapon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you shouldn't even be here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you can take me on with that level of power? It's laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mocking grin, Bram stepped closer to Osborne, unleashing a formidable aura that bore down on Osborne like a mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Osborne was just an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, and the gap in their strength was insurmountable. He figured that even his mere presence would be enough to make Osborne beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Bram's shock, Osborne seemed unfazed by the oppressive aura. He stood his ground, not even flinching in response to the overwhelming pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram furrowed his brow in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I'm an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King! Even if I'm injured from Jethro's explosion, I should still be stronger than any average Ascension Three Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is this guy, an Ascension One, not cowering before me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Interesting..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his bewilderment, Bram felt no fear. The vast difference in their power gave him absolute confidence that he could easily dispatch Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes narrowed as he unleashed a wave of murderous intent. "You've learned too much. Time for you to join your grandfather in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Bram made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flicked his wrist, and a powerful surge of energy coalesced into a deadly arrow, aimed straight at Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Bram's mind, this attack was more than enough to wipe out any Ascension One Supernal Deity King. Even an Ascension Two would find it hard to withstand such a blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched Osborne with a smirk, as if he were already staring at a corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne remained calm, his gaze locked onto Bram as if he hadn't even seen the incoming attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with a chilling resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Osborne felt a wave of dread wash over him. If he hadn't bound himself to Jethro through the Binding Twin Pearl, or if he had arrived even a moment later, his grandfather might have truly perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could save Jethro from his self-destruction&mdash;not even the Goddess of Life could bring him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne had arrived just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's absolute guardianship, he had copied Jethro's life essence. If he chose to, he could bring his grandfather back from the brink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that didn't mean Osborne wasn't furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Baxter family's Ascension Four Supernal Deity King had to pay for what he'd done!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who would've thought that after breaking through to Supernal Deity King, my first opponent would be an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King? I wonder if I can handle you..." Osborne thought, determination surging through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was time to put his skills to the test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he prepared to strike, Bram's attack was already hurtling towards him, the energy arrow aimed to pierce right through his body. In Bram's mind, the vision of Osborne being struck down played out vividly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with a swift motion, Osborne raised his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he caught the arrow with just his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the extraordinary power coursing through the projectile&mdash;a force that would have been nearly impossible for any other Ascension One Supernal Deity King to withstand&mdash;Osborne held firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow slid and screeched against his hand, yet he didn't draw even a drop of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a decisive squeeze, he crushed the energy arrow into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all the strength an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King has?" Osborne remarked casually, brushing the remnants off his hand with an air of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram's eyes nearly popped out of his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe his attack had failed so spectacularly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're hiding your true power?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, a glint of amusement in his eyes. "Let's just say I'm hiding a bit! But come on, Bram, show me what you've really got! If taking you down is as easy as it seems, I'm not sure I'll feel any satisfaction!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram's expression darkened. "You've chosen to die today, then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter if you've been hiding your strength, I can guarantee you haven't reached Ascension Four! You're no match for me. I'll show you the true might of an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, Bram launched himself into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His aura intensified, radiating with a force that was a hundred times stronger than before. He could no longer treat Osborne as a weakling; Osborne was a genuine opponent now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" Bram roared, condensing his power to form a massive arrow infused with frigid energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The temperature plummeted as he shot it forth, transforming the surrounding area into a winter wonderland as everything froze in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enormous ice arrow sped toward Osborne with terrifying velocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even before it arrived, Osborne could feel the sharp sting of cold pressure sweeping over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Now that's what I expect from an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But do you really think that would be enough to take me down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's just ridiculous! Shooting arrows? I can do that too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a blood-red, menacing bow materialized in Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he channeled lightning into it, drawing back the string.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a thunderous arrow crackled into existence, ready to be unleashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's lightning arrow collided with Bram's ice arrow, triggering a cataclysmic eruption of energy that obliterated everything around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwaves radiated outwards for hundreds of miles, causing chaos in their wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the aftermath, one figure was sent flying, crashing through the air.</span></p></div>
