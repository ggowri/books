        <h1>Chapter 2000 The Confused God of Light</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Alliance retreated another four million miles, but their morale was even lower this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sanctum of Light floated above them, as grand and radiant as ever, but it no longer inspired confidence in the Human Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their morale was in tatters after two consecutive days of a single win and seven losses. They had retreated eight million miles, with just 124 thousand miles left, before reaching Peaks City, one of the ten key cities of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peaks City had always been a strategic stronghold, often serving as the last line of defense against the invading forces of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Dark Deity Legion could not break through Peaks City, it could not advance deeper into the West Zone of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, if they continued to lose, they would have to give up Peaks City. If that happened, over a billion people in the city would need to evacuate. The logistical challenges alone would be overwhelming, and losing the city's defenses would be an unimaginable blow to the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Sanctum of Light, everyone was silent. There was no time to dwell on the devastating loss they had endured today. They thought, "What should we do tomorrow? Is there any hope left to win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, someone broke the silence. "If tomorrow's results are the same, we will lose Peaks City. Without it as a strategic base, how can we resist the Dark Deity Legion in an all-out war?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is the point of saying that? We cannot win! The gap is too big! We have adjusted our strategies, but the Dark Deity Legion has done the same, sending more prodigies from the top ten Upper Race and the Paramount Supreme Clan. We are no match for them!" someone else snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Loss after loss... I am about to lose all hope," another voice said bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, this border competition should not have even been held! If it were not for this, our morale would not be this low!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should we just start an all-out war then? How many people would die in that case? Do you think the gap would disappear?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it would only become more apparent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least we would not have to give up Peaks City without even fighting a real battle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Peaks City is still in our hands, but are you sure we will lose tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah, if we do not lose, can we win?" someone scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The argument grew heated, with people accusing and mocking each other. The atmosphere in the sanctum became tense as if it might erupt into conflict at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The continuous defeats had not only shattered their confidence but also threatened to tear them apart internally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" God of Light finally spoke, her voice cold and commanding. Her expression was grim, and deep worry flickered in her eyes. The border competition had been her idea. Initially, no one objected; everyone thought it was a good plan to reduce the Human Alliance's losses and buy more time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, people were questioning her decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light understood that the real question was not about the border competition but whether she still could protect the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation had become dire. The Human Community faced a total loss in the border competition, and their record was far worse than she had anticipated. The rapid collapse of morale had led to the possibility of losing Peaks City by the third day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had expected that even if the Human Community lost in the competition, they would at least win a few rounds each day, and with some luck, they might even gain an advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the repeated defeats had shown her that her hopes were too naive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "At this rate, we will keep losing, and there will be no hope of winning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hear it," God of Light said, her voice tinged with exhaustion. "What do you think we should do tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can we do? We have thought of every possible plan. It is just the difference in strength. No matter how we choose or arrange things, we cannot win!" Julian sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Jethro not say that the Hudson family was willing to take on the Deity Overlord Level and Deity King Level fights? Just let them go out tomorrow!" he added, his tone dripping with disdain. "After all, it is all the same&mdash;we are losing anyway!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Julian looked around, expecting to see Jethro, but he was nowhere to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Jethro?" he asked, surprised. "Did he leave? Did he know we could not win and decide not to send the Hudson family out? What a coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light also looked around, puzzled, but she said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard the bickering and felt a headache coming on. She waved her hand, signaling for everyone to leave. "Since there are no good suggestions, I will take care of the lineup for tomorrow. You all may leave now. I need some quiet time," she said, her voice firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian opened his mouth to protest but fell silent under the icy glare from God of Light. He shuddered, immediately bowing and leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sanctum fell silent, with only God of Light remaining, deep in thought. Her chin rested on her hand, her brows furrowed as she pondered what to do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I make a mistake by organizing this border competition?" she murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if I had not done this, how long could the Human Alliance hold out? How many more would die in the process?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I make the wrong choice?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night, where are you? Why have you not returned yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there anyone who can change the current situation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa?" she quietly pondered while Jethro was in contact with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, I was in the middle of a breakthrough when I hit a bottleneck. By the time I finally broke through, I had missed the best time to act," Osborne explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the past few years, Osborne focused on cultivating his Spatial Clone and the Undead Cataclysm in Hope Haven. After four years of effort, he had felt the breakthrough coming, but the difficulty was much higher than expected. It took him three more years to break through both abilities to Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, the border competition had already been underway for two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he learned of the disastrous situation of the border competition from Jethro, Osborne fell silent as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The Human Community has suffered a devastating defeat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap was overwhelming in every aspect, leaving no hope of victory in sight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least... I am out of seclusion now," Osborne said, his eyes flashing with a cold light. "No matter what happens next, the Human Community will not suffer such crushing defeats again."</span></p></div>
