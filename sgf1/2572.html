        <h1>Chapter 2469 Thirty-Eight Billion!</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was waiting for Osborne's harvest to be tallied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian, along with Gerald and the others, quickly calculated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The resources in the sky quickly diminished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, all the resources had been tallied and calculated, temporarily collected by Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian and Gerald were whispering to each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone could see the shock, envy, and jealousy on their faces. Finally, they stopped talking and looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, everyone grew expectant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How much is it?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, all your gains have been tallied. Congratulations, you are now the champion! Now, I will announce your results..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All your gains, converted into Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, amount to..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thirty-eight billion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've made history! The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, held once every ten years, has taken place thousands of times with roughly the same rules, but no one has ever had such an amount of Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even those who ultimately won the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel have never achieved such a high amount of Kingdom Duel Scorepoints! Congratulations to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Ian said this, there was jealousy deep in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thirty-eight billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In any Kingdom, one Kingdom Duel Scorepoint can be exchanged for at least one Sacred Crystal, which equals thirty-eight billion Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even those top-tier Second-rate Powers might not be able to produce so many Sacred Crystals, and some weaker First-rate Powers might not manage it either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Kingdom Duel Scorepoints are even more valuable than Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, no matter how many Sacred Crystals you have, you can't enter the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury to purchase the treasures within.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian is well aware of the exchange rates for the treasures in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One hundred million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can be exchanged for a decent Superior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can be exchanged for a decent Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And ten billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Can be exchanged for a decent Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's 3.8 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can easily be exchanged in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury for four decent Supreme Sacred Artifacts or one or two top-quality Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's a Supreme Sacred Artifact...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Ian, as a Royal Family member and a three-star general of the Glorious Divine Legion, only uses two Legendary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the Supreme Sacred Artifact...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian wouldn't even dare to think about it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Supreme Sacred Artifacts are something only the princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family or the leaders of First-rate Powers might possess.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He's still a bit lacking!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A disciple of a Second-rate Power, yet after the zone duel ended, had 38 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, with a chance to exchange for three or four Supreme Sacred Artifacts...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne didn&rsquo;t have a deadly hold over him, he&rsquo;d even want to kill Osborne right now and find every possible way to rob him clean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, he can't do that!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even has to worry that Osborne might be taken by others or get into trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Osborne said...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as Osborne dies, his friend will spread the video of him secretly watching Elisha bathe. By then, he&rsquo;ll be doomed, his family and friends will be implicated, and even Brent will be finished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you better be careful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Ian communicated to Osborne through Telepathy, "This time, the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints you earned are just too many! So many that even warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and Great Perfection realms might be tempted and want to seize your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seize my Kingdom Duel Scorepoints? Can my Kingdom Duel Scorepoints actually be taken by others?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gains could be exchanged for 38 billion, slightly higher than estimated. Osborne was very satisfied with this and was already calculating in his mind what else he could exchange for after retrieving the items that once belonged to Vivienne from the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, Ian told him that Kingdom Duel Scorepoints could be taken by others!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly, feeling a bit worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Empyrean Sacredness, Osborne could be said to fear no one. Even someone like Brenda, Osborne was confident he could defeat with a single arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No surprises!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But on Racial Convergence Planet, his strength was still not enough. Let alone Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection or Great Perfection, even an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior was not someone he could easily handle right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, if someone really wanted to snatch his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, he would be in great danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, once the zone duel ends, it will take a full six months before the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel begins.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And only after the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ends can he enter the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury to exchange items.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These 38 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, he must hold onto them for at least six months.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can, of course, be snatched!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian explained, "As long as they kill you and take your Kingdom Duel Badge, they can get your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints! By then, they can sell your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to a major power in exchange for Sacred Crystals, and no one will be able to trace it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They can even transfer the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to another Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel participant's Badge, allowing them to enter the treasury to exchange for treasures!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glorious Divine Kingdom only recognizes Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, not people!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Ian finished speaking, Osborne's expression grew even more serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, I suggest that after returning to Racial Convergence Planet, you leave with me immediately! I can take you to the 6th division of the Glorious Divine Legion; that's my territory, and I can protect you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There, even an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior wouldn't be able to seize your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints! Unless it's a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level being taking action!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In any case, I will protect you! We're in the same boat now, you should trust me, I won't harm you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Let him go to Ian's territory? To avoid potential plundering?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was unwilling!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want too much contact with Ian, to avoid Ian noticing anything unusual. Before having the strength to take Ian down, Osborne would keep his distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the fact that Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can be plundered is something he indeed needs to pay attention to.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll be careful! As for going to your place, forget it! I'm afraid it's even more dangerous there... After all, you're also working for Prince Brent! If Prince Brent knows I have so many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, wouldn't he be tempted?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered. "I'm afraid that fool might do something stupid!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was stunned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did Osborne just call Prince Brent a fool?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forget it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He decided to pretend he didn't hear it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian said, "Alright then! Just be careful! Anyway, if you run into trouble, make sure to contact me right away, and I'll definitely come to help you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chuckled and said nothing more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Cosmic Translocator is fixed! We can return to the Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, someone excitedly shouted.</span></p></div>
