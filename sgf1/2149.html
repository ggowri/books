        <h1>Chapter 2138 Annihilation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took the initiative, opting not to use his more powerful Dimensional Maw&mdash;he didn't need to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A simple Spatial Oblivion Slash was more than enough to deal with Uriel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Uriel was an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, with a higher cultivation level than Alfreda, but he lacked her Luminous Elven Wings. To Osborne, that made Uriel easier to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least defensively, Uriel was no match for Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne had defeated Alfreda, he was only at Ascension Two. Now, he had advanced to Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flurry of Dimensional Razors shot forth, colliding with Uriel's radiant form in an explosive clash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening explosion erupted, sending shockwaves rippling outward. In the next instant, a figure was sent sprawling backward, crashing into the ground and creating a massive crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Uriel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of Uriel's exploration team stood frozen, their mouths agape in disbelief as they stared at their fallen leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel had been blasted away by Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel had lost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel was an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, the pinnacle of talent in Elf City. He had returned with the memories of his past life, making him one of the most formidable warriors among the younger generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, having been sent flying by a mere Ascension Three human!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was too shocked to move, too stunned to rush to Uriel's aid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Alfreda wore a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had known Uriel's fate the moment Osborne made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thinking of Osborne as just another Ascension Three? That's a death wish!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne broke through my Luminous Elven Wings back when he was only Ascension Two! Now that he's Ascension Three, taking you down is a piece of cake. He hasn't even unleashed his strongest attack yet, nor has he used the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow. If he did, you'd already be a corpse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low, furious growl broke the silence as Uriel crawled out of the crater, looking utterly disheveled, blood dripping from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes, now bloodshot, locked onto Osborne, a mix of rage and fear swirling within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's power had shaken him to his core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that he had been sent reeling and injured while using his ultimate technique was a bitter pill to swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda was right&mdash;Osborne was indeed stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he hated to admit it, the evidence was clear. With the power Osborne had just </span><span>displayed, Uriel knew he was outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a glint of madness in his eyes, Uriel gritted his teeth and barked, "Everyone, listen up! We're attacking together! We have to take him down! Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Uriel unleashed a coordinated assault, rallying nearly a hundred warriors to attack Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the same tactic they had used to shatter Alfreda's defenses and defeat her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel hoped to replicate that success against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for them, Osborne wasn't Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What worked against her was utterly ineffective against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile crept onto Osborne's face as he remarked, "You should've done this sooner! But now, I'm done wasting time. Let's wrap this up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made his move again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he didn't need to create an absolute forbidden zone to suppress Uriel and his team's cultivation levels; it was simply unnecessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold expression, he extended his right hand. Energy surged around it, coalescing into a twisted black orb&mdash;a Dimensional Maw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dimensional Maw!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual wave of his hand, the Dimensional Maw shot forth toward Uriel and his group. Its speed was deceptively slow, but the terrifying gravitational pull it unleashed was anything but.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Uriel and his team unleashed their attacks, they found themselves caught in the terrifying gravitational pull of Osborne's Dimensional Maw. Their bodies were torn apart and crushed, unable to escape the suffocating force that drew them inexorably closer to the dark orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel, too, was ensnared in this deadly grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! This can't be happening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged within Uriel as he watched the Dimensional Maw pulsate ominously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling sense of dread enveloped him, reminiscent of a long-forgotten battle from ten millennia ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had faced a genius from the Sacred Dragon Clan back then, someone whose cultivation level was lower than his own. Despite his advantage, he had been utterly crushed, left to grapple with the despair of defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, facing Osborne, he felt that same hopelessness creeping back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything, Osborne was even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a desperate surge of power, Uriel fought against the pull of the Dimensional Maw, straining to break free, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the Dimensional Maw unleashed its full might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fueled by Osborne's Sacred Power, it obliterated everything in its path. If it could shatter Alfreda's Luminous Elven Wings, how could Uriel and his team hope to withstand its fury?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A catastrophic explosion erupted, sweeping away everything in its vicinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the area where Uriel and his allies stood was reduced to rubble. Ascension Five and Ascension Six foes were consumed by the relentless force of the </span><span>Dimensional Maw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cave trembled violently as a massive shockwave reverberated through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the chaos subsided, there was no one left standing before Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only one figure remained&mdash;a mangled body writhing in agony amidst the ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Uriel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against all odds, Uriel had survived the explosion of the Dimensional Maw, albeit in a shattered state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was nearly destroyed; limbs were missing, and he was barely holding on to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was nothing more than a shell of his former self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the formidable vitality of an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King kept him alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His screams echoed through the cave, filled with pain and resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Why is this happening? I won't accept this!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, Uriel, have endured ten thousand years of reincarnation, and finally regained my memories. I was meant to claim my place at the pinnacle of this cosmos! I was meant to be the strongest Elf King!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I die here?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I discovered the Sacred Artifact-level palace! It belongs to me!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, I refuse to accept this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's furious cries rang out, but they were futile. Everyone could sense his life force rapidly dwindling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good riddance! You had it coming for trying to ambush us! Dying is the least you deserve!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda shot </span><span>back,</span><span> her gaze icy as she watched Uriel's struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, too, was focused on Uriel, a frown creasing his brow. As Uriel's life force waned, Osborne felt a massive surge of energy building within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sacred Power?! No! It's going to explode! Get back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne grabbed Alfreda's hand and activated interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they moved, Uriel's body erupted in a cataclysmic explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of intense Sacred Power surged forth from him, creating a shockwave that obliterated everything in the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blast was so powerful that even the several Umbra World beings present were instantly annihilated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the explosion subsided, silence fell over the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a deep, authoritative voice echoed in the stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless fool! You can't even handle a small task without my intervention!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this works out just fine.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Sacred Artifact-level palace is now mine!"</span></p></div>
