        <h1>Chapter 1742 A Battle to the Fullest</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive energy millstone came crashing down, forcing Osborne to furrow his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich had to be acknowledged for his quick response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had delayed even slightly, Osborne could have siphoned enough power from the Blood Clan descendants to break through the bottleneck between the Deity Overlord realm and the Deity King realm, temporarily reaching the heights of the Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, he would have been more than capable of easily defeating, suppressing, and perhaps even eliminating Aldrich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now, he remained at the peak of the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Aldrich's assault approaching, Osborne had no choice but to face it head-on; if he hesitated, he would be crushed before he could ascend to Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can kill me?" Osborne scoffed. "You might be overestimating yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Supreme Malevolence Sword suddenly appeared in his hand, dark energy swirling around the blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slashed upward with ferocity, unleashing a terrifying wave of black energy that cleaved through the enormous millstone descending from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal stone shattered under his strike, exploding into fragments that scattered outward like a shockwave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even an experienced Deity Overlord struggled to maintain their footing in the wake of such might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich's expression morphed from disbelief to fury as he stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I poured all my strength into that attack, and this guy just sliced right through it? How is that even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next heartbeat, his gaze narrowed sharply on the Supreme Malevolence Sword in Osborne's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Supreme Malevolence Sword! How could a lowly Human Community member possess something like that?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich unleashed his fury, shattering the residual energy with a wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, his confidence evident. "Why shouldn't I have the Supreme Malevolence Sword?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for a death wish! The Supreme Malevolence Sword is a treasure meant only for the geniuses or high-ranking members of the Paramount Supreme Clan! You, a measly human?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What right do you have to wield it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me! Where did you get that blade?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The malice in Aldrich's eyes was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shrugging nonchalantly, Osborne replied, "Haven't you already figured it out? That's right, I got my Supreme Malevolence Sword after taking out a genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan! His name was... Tobey!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a loser&mdash;he had the Supreme Malevolence Sword and the Supreme Malevolence Airship, yet I took him down without breaking a sweat. Naturally, his precious treasures came to me! I have no idea who his father is, but he sure raised a complete moron and a waste of space!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot a mocking glance toward Aldrich, knowing full well that Tobey was his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich's face turned a furious shade of red, his eyes blazing with rage as he clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So it was you who killed my son! You filthy bastard! I'll make you pay! I'll grind you to dust and skin you alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, Aldrich drew his own Supreme Malevolence Sword and charged at Osborne, unleashing a flurry of gleaming sword strokes that streaked toward him in a blinding flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Aldrich was truly going all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, he hadn't even bothered to use the Supreme Malevolence Sword; now, fueled by his desire for vengeance, he held nothing back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blinding sword rays hurtled through the air, rapidly closing in on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned serious; Aldrich's previous strength had already been formidable, and now, with the enhancement of the Supreme Malevolence Sword, he was a much tougher opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As far as divine artifacts were concerned, he didn't feel inferior to Aldrich at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both warriors wielded their Supreme Malevolence Swords, channeling elemental dark power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed that Aldrich's dark power was at a higher level, undeniably reaching mid-Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when it came to control over dark energy and sheer strength, Osborne had the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the only reason he hadn't been swiftly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dark power surpassed Aldrich's!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the gap in their level was simply too vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the fierce clash, Osborne found himself increasingly on the back foot, his body occasionally cut by Aldrich's sword energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the healing effects of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he would have likely been out of the fight by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, brows knit in concentration, "I can't keep this up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In a battle this intense, I can't afford to 'borrow power'. Otherwise, my energy will go haywire. Before Aldrich even has a chance to land a hit, I might just implode!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a growing sense of urgency, he contemplated the risks of revealing his spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was inevitable; he would have to expose it sooner or later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his current strength, even if he revealed his spatial power, it wouldn't matter all that much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, determination flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's truly go all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shifted his approach, the atmosphere thickening as he called forth darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipse of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelming shroud of black engulfed him and Aldrich, plunging the battlefield into a realm of shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Clone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, eight clones materialized around Osborne, each mimicking his aura with eerie precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne charged, accompanied by his clones, converging toward Aldrich with reckless abandon.</span></p></div>
