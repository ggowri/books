        <h1>Chapter 1413 Malevolence Amulet</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp scythe of the Goddess of Grain sliced through the air, aimed straight at Lachlan's neck. He had no time to react; even as a Transcendent Deity Warrior, his divine power couldn't shield him from such a swift attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the scythe was about to sever his head, something unexpected happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The insignia of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, pinned to Lachlan's chest, shattered into a thousand pieces, unleashing an incredible force that surged forward, forming a protective barrier around him. The scythe's deadly arc was suddenly halted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell was that? What kind of defense is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Lachlan roared, pivoting sharply to deliver a powerful punch that sent Osborne staggering backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that brief moment, he created some distance, his eyes burning with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You! You're in cahoots with my men? You all deserve to die! You think you can kill me? You're dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, frustration boiling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The perfect ambush had just unraveled, and he couldn't help but feel a pang of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is that protective force that saved Lachlan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert shouted, explaining to Osborne, "That's the Malevolence Amulet! It's a special artifact forged by the Artisan Institute. Every captain of the Dark Deity Legion receives one. Normally, it serves as an identity badge, but when faced with a lethal attack, it detonates to release a powerful shield that can block fatal blows!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan's is just a captain-level Malevolence Amulet, so its defensive power is limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we strike together, we can break through it quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, understanding dawning on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smirk, he said, "A Malevolence Amulet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A special artifact that can unleash a powerful shield to save your skin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It might protect you once, but it won't save you twice. You, a human, have chosen to be Lord Malevolence's lapdog, turning against your own kind. You must die here today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's expression twisted with madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to kill me? You're out of your mind! As for serving Lord Malevolence and betraying my own kind? So what? I just want an easier life! The native humans of Celestara are a hopeless race destined to vanish into the annals of history!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only by submitting to Lord Malevolence and serving him faithfully can we survive and elevate our lowly bloodline!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So I'm not wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The real mistake lies with those who still resist&mdash;if it weren't for them, the native humans of Celestara would have been accepted by Lord Malevolence long ago, becoming one of his many clans!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, all who dare to defy Lord Malevolence should be eliminated, and that includes you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's eyes glowed with a fierce, bloodthirsty light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Lachlan with pity, thinking, "This man has truly lost his mind. He's forgotten his own roots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To call the native humans of Celestara a lowly race is both laughable and tragic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he can't even respect himself, how can he expect anyone else to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder his nine subordinates look down on him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice turned icy. "You're the one who needs to be purged! It's people like you who make the native humans of Celestara look weak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you can go ahead and die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne struck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he hadn't managed to finish off Lachlan before, he wasn't overly concerned. Lachlan was already wounded, and in the tight confines of the mine, there was nowhere for him to run. Osborne was confident he could take him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After regaining his Intermediate Deity status, his divine power and Divine Body were on par with any Transcendent Deity warrior; he could grind Lachlan into dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was, of course, as long as those other five Superior Deities didn't interfere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook with each of Osborne's relentless attacks, driving Lachlan backward until his face turned as pale as a sheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan yelled at his companions, desperation lacing his voice, "Why aren't you guys doing anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This man is a lowly human, a sinner to Lord Malevolence! Are you really going to wait until he kills me before you decide to fight back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he shouted, the expressions of the other five men shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gazes toward Osborne turned hostile, and after a quick exchange of looks, they all lunged at him simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Block them!" Osborne commanded Albert and Laird, keeping the pressure on Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The defense shield of Lachlan's Malevolence Amulet shattered under Osborne's relentless barrage. Without its protection, Lachlan's own divine power and Divine Body were utterly insufficient against the scythe of the Goddess of Grain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Lachlan was drenched in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath came in ragged gasps, and his eyes reflected a mix of fury and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! I'm the squad leader of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am loyal to Lord Malevolence! If you kill me, you won't come out of this unscathed, either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All the lowly native humans of Celestara deserve to be purged!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They all... should be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before he could finish, his head was suddenly severed and flew through the air with a sickening thump.</span></p></div>
