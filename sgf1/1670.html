        <h1>Chapter 1669 Escape</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's divine power essence had been disabled, so he hadn't joined the battle. Instead, he hid at the back, eyes glued to the white Miracle Elixir growing on the humanoid stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in a blink, both the stone and the elixirs vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's heart raced with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white Miracle Elixir was his last hope for restoring his divine power essence. How could he accept this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately shouted, his voice filled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop him! We can't let him take the Miracle Elixirs! Stop him now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's cries finally caught Edison and his group's attention. They glanced over, and their faces turned livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison roared, his anger boiling over, "Dammit, leave the Miracle Elixirs behind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care who you are, but I advise you to leave the Miracle Elixirs here. Mr. Angelo Royston found them first, and he won't let you get away with this. You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison tried to charge forward to block Osborne's escape, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Spatial Clones were just as powerful as he was, even capable of using Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at the peak of the Deity Overlord realm, Edison couldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Edison could only shout at Osborne, his heart filled with the hope that Angelo would hurry over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused, glancing at Edison before his gaze settled on the frantic and desperate Calvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin, I was planning to deal with you later, but you're asking for it. I'll give you what you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ordered his clone, "Kill him!" then turned and disappeared into the fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the clones immediately abandoned its opponent, reaching Calvin in a flash, wearing a cold smile as it stared him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's body went numb with terror as he felt the chilling intent to kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help, help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He screamed, looking toward Athena, but she was already fleeing rapidly in the opposite direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way she would risk her life to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with her being in the mid-Deity Overlord realm, facing Osborne's clones was a suicide mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena ran!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Calvin felt a wave of despair wash over him; his face contorted in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clone grabbed Calvin by the neck in the next moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Calvin heard Osborne's voice in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin, before you die, I have to tell you something. I am Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's eyes bulged in disbelief, staring at the figure that had him by the throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin tried to speak, but before he could finish, the clone twisted his neck effortlessly, and Calvin's life ended in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Calvin dead, the clone wasted no time and bolted into the distance. Edison and his group were powerless to stop them, watching helplessly as all four clones vanished into the fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had already reached Diana's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wielding the Supreme Malevolence Sword, having already slain one peak Deity Overlord Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last one was heavily wounded, and with a bit more time, she would finish it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they couldn't afford the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne struck the final blow, eliminating the last Deathborn. Then, he grabbed Diana's hand, and they both vanished into the parallel space, escaping quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Dammit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments after they left, a powerful figure burst onto the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Angelo!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo had unleashed his full power, finally wiping out all the Deathborn forces on the platform. He immediately rushed over, but to his dismay, the Miracle Elixirs were nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through Edison and his group, he learned what had transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chased after the direction Osborne had fled, but it was too late. There was no sign of Osborne or the Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's anger boiled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were three Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Angelo had obtained them, his strength would have advanced significantly, and both his potential and lifespan would have greatly increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were all gone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been so close, only to see someone else reap the rewards!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo couldn't bear it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find out! Dig deep and find out who dared to steal my Miracle Elixirs! I don't care who they are&mdash;I will kill them!" Angelo growled, his voice trembling with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison and his group were also frustrated, but they had no choice. They quickly examined the area, hoping to find some clues from the battle's aftermath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A short while later, Edison's face hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Angelo Royston, I'm afraid we can't continue our investigation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo frowned. "Why not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because we found traces of the Supreme Malevolence Sword around here. One of the people who took the Miracle Elixirs was using the Supreme Malevolence Sword!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Supreme Malevolence Sword! That's a sword only the geniuses of the Paramount Supreme Clan can possess! Someone from the Paramount Supreme Clan did it?"</span></p></div>
