        <h1>Chapter 1915 The War of Attrition</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a typical clash of soul power, he knew he'd struggle against Adolph. Although his own soul power was vast, it paled in comparison to Adolph's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after traveling billions of miles, Adolph's soul power remained formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, their mastery over soul power was worlds apart; in a fair fight, Osborne's soul power would simply crumble under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity on his side, he wouldn't stand a chance against Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Adolph's soul power had detached and invaded his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a death wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A detached soul power was like a tree uprooted&mdash;without nourishment, it would only grow weaker and more sparse until it ultimately faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was seething with rage, unable to fathom how Osborne's soul power could be so absurdly resilient, continuously recovering and even growing stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this keeps up, I'm going to be drained dry here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of unwillingness crossed Adolph's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't foolish; as an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King of soul power, he recognized his precarious situation. If he stayed and fought, he would be worn down by Osborne's relentless soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smartest move now was to retreat from Osborne's Soul Current Ocean and return to his original form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident Osborne couldn't stop him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as Adolph gazed at the shimmering golden soul power and the unique golden Soul Current Ocean, he felt a pang of reluctance. This golden Soul Current Ocean was too special to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I could harness this golden Soul Current Ocean, my soul power might transform into gold, too! Just imagine how powerful I could become!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greed filled Adolph's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then even an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King wouldn't stand a chance against me! If I break through again, I could become the tenth Dark Sovereign under the esteemed Lord Malevolence&mdash;truly a position of unparalleled power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught in this internal struggle, Adolph was torn between staying to obliterate Osborne's soul power or making a hasty retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne sensed Adolph's conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! He's thinking about escaping!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow. While he was confident he could drain Adolph's soul power here, he knew he couldn't stop Adolph if Adolph decided to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in their abilities was simply too vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't specifically trained for soul power; the strength he had was either a fluke or a gift. There was no way Osborne could block Adolph if he wanted to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Adolph's soul power invading his Soul Current Ocean, attacking him, and then slipping away unscathed was unacceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't let him get away! If I can't stop his soul power from returning, then I'll just have to destroy his original form! If I obliterate his body, he won't be able to escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that realization, a spark ignited in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of soul power shot out from his Soul Current Ocean, disappearing into the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the floating mountain above East Zone's Wild Flame City, the atmosphere was eerily quiet. A group of Paramount Supreme Clan warriors were quietly discussing Adolph's absence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One man said, "Why hasn't Mr. Adolph Eldridge returned yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a second-tier Supernal Deity King of soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His detached soul power should easily handle taking down Theodore's soul power, right? Or could he have stumbled upon something amazing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chuckled among themselves, unaware of the brewing storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They watched as Adolph sat cross-legged, eyes closed, with a flickering flame of golden fire dancing before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a fragment of Osborne's soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's Soul Spark Oblivion was on the verge of incinerating it completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the flames surged with renewed intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the brink of annihilation, Osborne's soul power seemed to draw on some hidden reserve, flaring up with newfound vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, it shot straight into Adolph's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's original form was empty, a vast void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's soul power slipped effortlessly into his Soul Current Ocean, and without hesitation, it self-destructed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silent explosion of soul power went unnoticed by Adolph's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in that instant, his Soul Current Ocean was decimated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" At that moment, Adolph's soul power, still lingering in Osborne's Soul Current Ocean and grappling with the decision to escape, felt the catastrophic shift in its original form. It erupted in a mix of terror and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you actually destroyed my Soul Current Ocean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's roar echoed with murderous intent directed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that with his original Soul Current Ocean in ruins, there was no way back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His only chance of survival now lay in obliterating Osborne's soul and seizing control of Osborne's Soul Current Ocean!</span></p></div>
