        <h1>Chapter 960 Desperate</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's icy gaze locked onto the two of them, and in a swift motion, he seized Osborne by the throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's start with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A mere Class AAA dares to challenge me? You'll be the first&mdash;and the last. I'm going to snap your neck like a twig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, I believe he's your only grandson, isn't he? Your son vanished over twenty years ago, and after all that time searching, you should have accepted he's dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you'll have to watch as I break your only grandson's neck right before your eyes. Can you imagine the pain that must bring you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a gifted boy, far surpassing both your and my youth. Given enough time, he could easily eclipse our achievements and perhaps even become the strongest on Blue Planet. And yet, here I am, about to snuff out his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be in agony, watching all that potential go to waste!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His laughter rang out like a death knell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's eyes blazed with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If looks could kill, Gerardo would have been dead a thousand times over. How could Sebastian stand by and watch Osborne perish? The thought was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was frozen in place, his body petrified, unable to move or save his grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo cackled at the madness reflected in Sebastian's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've lost, Sebastian!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to kill your only grandson and ensure your bloodline ends here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's grip tightened as he prepared to snap Osborne's neck, leaving the young man powerless to resist, staring into the abyss of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a deafening explosion erupted, sending both Osborne and Gerardo flying apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blast had come from Sebastian himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo, you think you can kill my grandson? I'll fight you to the bitter end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's voice rang out, wild and desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was a wreck, a massive wound gaping in his chest, but he charged at Gerardo with reckless abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, dazed and disoriented, struggled to comprehend what was happening. The explosion had shattered the stone encasing him, and he quickly regained his footing, eyes darting to Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the horrific injury on Sebastian's body made Osborne's heart ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo, momentarily stunned, stared at Sebastian in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened as he coldly remarked, "Sebastian, you detonated a divine artifact? Just to save your grandson? Don't you realize that such an explosion can't possibly harm me? You'll be the one who pays the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's response was a grim smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what of it? If it means saving my grandson, I'll gladly pay the price with my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As those words hung in the air, a frantic voice echoed in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, run! I'll hold Gerardo off for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here! Don't even think about avenging me until you have the strength to do so. Find a place to hide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body jolted at the urgency in Sebastian's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at his grandfather, whose eyes were filled with fierce determination. Clearly, Sebastian was prepared to sacrifice everything for Osborne's escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!" Sebastian's voice rang out again, laced with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his heart pounding and emotions swirling, Osborne bit down on his lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tore open a dimensional rift, prepared to escape into the safety of Dimensional Space. But almost instantly, he hesitated. He tightened his grip on the Goddess of Grain's scythe, turning instead to charge at Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Run?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't abandon my family, not when there is a chance to help. If it comes to running, I'll take Grandpa with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!" Osborne shouted, his voice icy as he followed closely behind Sebastian, both men racing towards Gerardo with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unexpected resolve left Sebastian stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold, mocking smile crept across Gerardo's face. "Fool! Right now, I can't access any spatial powers. If you'd chosen to run, I might've had trouble stopping you. You had a chance to escape, but how stupid of you to choose to stay and die alongside your grandpa?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since that's the case, how could I let you down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you and your grandfather are willing to fight to the death for one another, then I'll make sure you both die together. Off to hell you go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gerardo unleashed a torrent of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's expression shifted in alarm, and he lunged to shield Osborne, pouring all his strength into the effort. But it was too much&mdash;he couldn't hold it back. Gerardo's power slammed into him, and he spat blood as he was sent flying backward, his already serious injuries worsening with the sudden impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Sebastian trying to block the attack, Osborne felt the immense force crashing through his body, sending him hurtling back as blood erupted from his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo laughed, his eyes shining with ominous light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Petrify!"</span></p></div>
