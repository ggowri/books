        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered at their words. "How did you morons manage to survive this long? After killing two of you, what makes you think I'd spare the others? Since I'm already wanted, might as well take a few more with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two, frantically grasping at straws, quickly replied, "No! If you let us go, we can take the blame for this! No one will know it was you; we'll report they were killed by Deathborn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled coldly. "Why should I trust you? What if you turn on me the moment I let you go? You need to earn my trust."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They furrowed their brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Earn your trust? What do you need us to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled. "Allow me to control you. I'll place a restraint on you to ensure no betrayal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury erupted. "Control us? You think a lowly human can impose his will on us? Never!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile turned icy. "In that case, off to death you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two, already battered, struggled under Osborne's relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for Osborne's leniency, they'd be long dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the shadow of death, their faces reflected sheer terror and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Final chance: immediate death or accept my restraint and control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes met, filled with hesitation and struggle, but survival instinct prevailed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we agree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're willing to accept any restrictions you place upon us so long as you spare our lives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, though, was another story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Filthy human, whatever restraint you put on us, we'll find a way to break. This is just for survival. You think you can control us? Dream on! Once we're free, you'll pay dearly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, guessing their thoughts, sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was confident they'd never betray him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not placing a restraint but intending to transform them into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once transformed, they'd be utterly loyal, even willing to die for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stopped his assault, saying, "Smart choice. Now, drop your defenses to accept my restraint."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two felt humiliated but complied, opening their defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged furtive glances, speculating about what restraints Osborne might impose upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne infused a drop of blood into their Divine Bodies, initiating the Blood Clan transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched anxiously because this was uncharted territory for him, having never transformed Dark Deities before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Success remained uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a plan, a masterstroke that, if successful, would solidify his standing in Celestara and possibly tilt the scales in humanity's favor against Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The key was whether Dark Deities could also undergo the transformation into Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched intently as their Divine Bodies absorbed his blood, triggering a violent metamorphosis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their forms swelled and rapidly reverted to their true shapes: one took the form of a massive eagle, the other, a terrifyingly ferocious tiger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their visages, though, were decidedly more menacing than mere hawks and tigers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They unleashed silent roars, their veins bulging under the strain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne feared they might explode from the stress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, such a calamity did not occur. Soon, both successfully transformed into Blood Clan, their bodies normalizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they regained their true forms, their gazes towards Osborne brimmed with fervent loyalty rather than hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Albert Thurman of the Aether Hawks Clan, at your service, my Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laird Borden of the Fero Tiger Clan, at your command, my Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exhaled in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, it's not just humans who can become Blood Clan. Dark Deity races can, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aether Hawks Clan? Fero Tiger Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this, my plan can finally move forward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes shone brightly with realization.</span></p></div>
