        <h1>Chapter 1213 Take Action</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne issued the command, and the members of Blood Demon sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they divided themselves into ten combat teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from the Blood Demon Vanguard, which had only a hundred members, each of the other teams consisted of around five hundred warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Beast Tide was attacking from every corner of the city, flooding through the streets and pressing into the heart of Hearin City. To effectively counter this onslaught, the Blood Demon members had to split up, allowing them to engage more of the relentless waves of beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even dividing into ten teams felt insufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne chose not to split them further. Doing so would be too risky; with the current arrangement, he could ensure that each team could withstand an attack from a Dark Deity for a short time, buying precious moments for reinforcements to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they split into smaller units, they would lack the strength to form effective formations, leading to unnecessary casualties&mdash;a thought that Osborne could not bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the Blood Demon members had already reached the pinnacle of Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had invested considerable time and energy into their training, and he was determined to protect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was on the brink of completing the third phase of his fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, which would grant the Blood Demon members a form of immortality, transforming them into an invincible legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, at that moment, each member was invaluable; he couldn't afford to lose anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce battle cry, the ten Blood Demon combat teams surged into the fray. They tore through everything in their path&mdash;ordinary Ferocious Beasts, Dark Exotic Beasts, and even Class S Dark Exotic Beasts fell under their relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They moved like ten whirling machines of death, sounding the horn of slaughter and unleashing a storm of carnage upon the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is that? Has the Deschanel family finally joined the fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the struggle to fend off the Beast Tide, the defenders&mdash;ordinary citizens and warriors from various Ancient and wealthy families in Hearin City&mdash;watched in awe as the Blood Demon members appeared, wreaking havoc on the Beast Tide. They began to push the beasts back, clearing the battlefield with remarkable efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hearin City is saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be the elite fighters from the Deschanel family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cheers erupted from the crowd, a wave of hope washing over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone shouted, "Wait! Those aren't the Deschanel family's fighters! Look at their chests&mdash;they bear the mark of a drop of strange blood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That strange blood is the symbol of the Blood Demon from Newport City, affiliated with the Augustine family! They say this Blood Demon has emerged out of nowhere, boasting power even greater than the Draco Armed Services Branch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family has come to our aid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Demon has arrived! We're saved! Everyone, fight back! Let's wipe out these damned beasts and drive them from our city!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed vigor, the defenders surged forward, ignited by the presence of the Blood Demon teams. Together, they managed to stabilize the situation, temporarily halting the Beast Tide's advance into Hearin City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle raged on, a cacophony of power colliding in the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer number of beasts was staggering, spread across a wide area, nearly encircling Hearin City. Even with the incredible strength of the Blood Demon members, maintaining control was only a temporary solution. Completely vanquishing the Beast Tide would prove to be an uphill battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had activated his Phantom Steps, traversing the parallel spaces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't rushing into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Blood Demon members around, the current Beast Tide was manageable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over 48 hundred Blood Demon members, most of them already at the peak of Class S, and the rest not far from it&mdash;this force was no joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with a million-strong Beast Tide, including 100 thousand Class A and above Dark Exotic Beasts and over 10 thousand Class S Dark Exotic Beasts, the Blood Demon's defense was impregnable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it was the Blood Demon members who were systematically slaughtering them, rapidly reducing the Beast Tide's numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the battle continued this way, in a few hours, the Blood Demon would undoubtedly eliminate the Beast Tide entirely, every last Dark Exotic Beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew it wouldn't be that simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a massive Beast Tide; how could it not be controlled by a Dark Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's inactivity was a precaution against that Dark Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His opponent was the Dark Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne moved through the parallel spaces, weaving through the battlefield, the terrifying combat and erupting powers around him couldn't touch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was now closely observing the Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These creatures were disgustingly ugly, resembling cockroaches with their pitch-black bodies, foldable wings, and a pair of whip-like, menacing tentacles.</span></p></div>
