        <h1>Chapter 2549 Agatha's Confession</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished his seclusion and decided to spend the remaining time with his family while helping them improve their strength a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He now had abundant resources, including endless Sacred Crystals, various levels of Dragon Elixirs, and Sacred Artifacts of all grades. Enhancing everyone's strength was incredibly easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, Osborne spent some time building safe houses on Celestara Planet, and within them, he also constructed Cosmic Translocators.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he's not on Celestara Planet, if a warrior unexpectedly arrives at Racial Convergence Planet intending harm, they can hide in the safe house and activate the Cosmic Translocator to escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, everything is for safety.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Celestara Planet is just a small life-bearing planet, beings above Empyrean Sacredness usually wouldn't come here or take an interest in it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne still needs to be prepared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Osborne used the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to replicate everyone's life essence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After this retreat, Osborne discovered that the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had become even stronger. He replicated everyone's life essence again, so if anything happens to them, he can sense it even from a great distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, directly resurrect everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With these multiple arrangements in place, Osborne finally felt at ease, and there were only ten days left until the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I should return to Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although reluctant, Osborne had to bid farewell to his family. Under their wistful gazes, Osborne stood on the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Father, Mother! After I leave, dismantle this part of the Cosmic Translocator! This way, no one else can use it to reach Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can reinstall it when you want to use it yourselves!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne reminded once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got it! You've said it three times already! Don't worry, we're very safe on Celestara Planet! You're the one who needs to be careful on Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne held Osborne's hand tightly, her eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We won't stop you from seeking revenge, but remember, there are many loved ones here worrying about you! So, you must act carefully and never be impulsive! Only by staying alive can you avenge, don't let hatred cloud your judgment, understand?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have no other requests, I just want you to stay alive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne bit his lip and nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I know!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Osborne waved goodbye to everyone and glanced at Agatha beside him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha also finished her retreat and returned to Racial Convergence Planet with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha's strength had also greatly improved. In the hundredfold Time Acceleration, she used up one hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir, twenty drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir, and absorbed all the branches of the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her gains were no less than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just from her current advanced Empyrean Sacredness cultivation level, it was evident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Osborne felt that Agatha was about to break through to Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection soon!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her breakthrough speed was simply too fast!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And her greatest gain wasn't the improvement and breakthrough in cultivation level, but her Dark Phoenix Bloodline becoming purer and more powerful than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, without using the Sublime Concealment Orb, Osborne could feel immense pressure from Agatha, as if she were a blazing abyss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She truly made people feel dread!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said to Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha nodded, bid farewell to Osborne's parents and others, and the Cosmic Translocator was activated. The two figures quickly vanished from Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the two appeared on Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mystic Sirius Sect, involved in slave trade dealings, had already been casually wiped out by Adriana. Osborne, on Racial Convergence Planet, now had no place to stay.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How about we head straight to the royal city of Glorious Divine Kingdom&mdash;Nebula City? The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel is in ten days, so going early to prepare would be good."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I want to return to Ember Phoenix Clan! I want to find out who those black-masked warriors that hunted me down were! I want to avenge Ember Phoenix Clan!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha gritted her teeth and said. At this moment, she was already an advanced Empyrean Sacredness, ready to break through to Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection at any time. She felt that she now had enough strength to investigate what happened back then and enough power to find a way to seek revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no reason to stop Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Those who hunted you down back then were very powerful! Most of them were Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, and there might even have been Proto-Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors among them...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With your current strength, seeking revenge might be difficult, but with the Sublime Concealment Orb, your safety shouldn't be an issue! So, I won't stop you...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But we are friends! Remember, if you encounter any problems, you can contact me anytime. I won't stand by and do nothing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha heard this and slightly raised her head to look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, I understand!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she took a deep breath and said, "But, are we really just friends? What exactly do you feel about me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Agatha in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha bit her lip tightly, and the next second, she suddenly leaned toward Osborne. Before he could react, she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to push Agatha away, but after hesitating for a moment, he ultimately didn't.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Agatha willingly let go of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes were a bit flustered, her face flushed red, and she lowered her head, saying, "I remember all the kindness you've shown me! I... I have no way to repay you! From now on, you're my man, Osborne! Once I've avenged myself... I'll come find you, and then I'll stay by your side forever as your woman!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, you've fused with my Phoenix Blood and ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame, so you can be considered to have the Dark Phoenix Bloodline now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To keep my Dark Phoenix Bloodline pure, I've decided to only be with you in this lifetime!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are not allowed to refuse!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Agatha didn't wait for Osborne to speak and quickly turned around and ran off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne touched his lips, recalling Agatha's words in his mind, and couldn't help but feel a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He helped Agatha with no other intentions, purely treating her as a friend.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Agatha seemed to have misunderstood...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he realized he didn't resist it. Agatha was the only Dark Phoenix in this world, and to the Ember Phoenix Clan, she was the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took the initiative to express her feelings to him, and he couldn't bring himself to refuse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, thinking of Isa, Clarissa, and others warning him not to flirt outside, he felt a bit guilty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it! I'll think about it later!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly stopped thinking about it, prayed in his heart that Agatha would be safe, and stepped into the Cosmic Translocator once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, his destination was the royal city of the Glorious Divine Kingdom&mdash;Nebula City!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nebula City, a place incredibly familiar in Osborne's memory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The royal palace of the Glorious Divine Kingdom was in Nebula City. In his previous life, Osborne lived in Nebula City, where he had beautiful memories, but even more painful ones.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There, he was once looked down upon, humiliated, beaten, and tortured...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's eyes were filled with coldness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nebula City! I, Osborne, am back again!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone in the royal palace...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've come for you!"</span></p></div>
