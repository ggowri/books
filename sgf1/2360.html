        <h1>Chapter 2290 Arctic Maw Chasm-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? The Arctic Maw Chasm?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Rupert's words slipped out, the place went up in a storm of noise. At least half of the people there looked like they'd seen a ghost, Agatha and Horace included.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other half were just blank-faced because they'd never even heard of the "Arctic Maw Chasm".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In neither his past life nor this one had he ever come across the name Arctic Maw Chasm. But looking at everyone's faces around him, he knew this place was no joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly hollered at Gustave, who wasn't too far off, "Gustave, what is the Arctic Maw Chasm? Is there something fishy about this place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave looked as serious as a heart attack at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Osborne's question, he replied right away, "Osborne, you guys are from Tempest Fortress City. It's miles away from Frost Peak City, so it's no wonder you've never heard of the Arctic Maw Chasm! But folks around Frost Peak City all know about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's basically a no-go zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's gobbled up countless Empyrean Sacredness powerhouses. Even the big-wigs at the Empyrean Sacredness level don't just waltz into the Arctic Maw Chasm. They might just end up in there for good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said this, Gustave let out a wry smile. "I never thought they'd pick the Arctic Maw Chasm as the venue for our state duel! What are the Zephyr State officials thinking? Do they want us to go and get ourselves killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. He figured things couldn't be that cut-and-dried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The folks taking part in the state duel were the top dogs just below the Empyrean Sacredness level in the whole Zephyr State. The Zephyr State officials surely wouldn't send them to their graves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, the major powers would kick up a huge stink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Rupert continued, "Pipe down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, chill out! We're well aware of how dangerous the Arctic Maw Chasm is. We're not gonna send you to your doom! Not every nook and cranny of the Arctic Maw Chasm is a death trap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Zephyr State officials have done a pretty thorough exploration of the whole Arctic Maw Chasm. It's divided into nine layers! Given your strength, the first three layers are a piece of cake. Apart from the rough and tricky environment, there won't be too many headaches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, the fourth to sixth layers? That's a whole different ballgame for most of you. It's not a guaranteed one-way ticket, but it's easy to get in a bind. So, play it smart. If you're not feeling confident, stay above the fourth layer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the seventh to ninth layers, those are seriously off-limits!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even an Empyrean Sacredness warrior has a high chance of biting the dust if they enter the seventh layer. And the eighth layer? Even if I went down there, I'd probably be a goner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And as for the ninth layer, no one's ever come out of the ninth layer alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for whether there's a tenth layer below the ninth, well, it's anyone's guess. But that's none of your business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The tokens for the state duel will be spread out across the first six layers of the Arctic Maw Chasm. There are six kinds of tokens, each worth different points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tokens on the first layer? They're worth one point!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tokens on the second layer? That's ten points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tokens on the third layer? A cool hundred points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tokens on the fourth layer? A thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tokens on the fifth layer? Ten thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tokens on the sixth layer A whopping hundred thousand points!</span></p></div>
