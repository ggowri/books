        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What on earth is this? It's actually hidden so deep." Osborne was incredibly curious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had pushed Satan's Eye to its absolute limit, yet there was nothing around him but molten lava.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial didn't speak, seemingly lost in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Osborne noticed something different. "There's something wrong ahead. There's a misty area there, and my Satan's Eye can't see through it. I feel a faint trace of life coming from that area."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded. "Let's head over quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned and asked, "Won't this be dangerous?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. At least, I don't sense any danger. Doesn't your Satan's Eye also anticipate danger?" Primordial said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Satan's Eye was calm and indeed sensed no danger. Osborne no longer hesitated and immediately sped up toward the misty area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he appeared outside the misty area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This place was very strange, surrounded by scorching, terrifying lava, yet there was a pale blue mist. The mist was oval-shaped, with a diameter of about 1600 feet. However, even Osborne's Satan's Eye couldn't see through what was inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the faint life aura emanating from within was clearly visible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What could be inside?" Thinking this, Osborne touched the mist with his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He discovered that the mist was incredibly powerful, not only blocking the terrifying lava around it but also preventing him from entering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Its defense is so powerful." Osborne felt that this mist was even stronger than the Warfare Mist of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne looked at Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There must be something inside. Use the Warfare Scythe to cut through this mist directly," Primordial said decisively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nodding, Osborne didn't hesitate and immediately took out the Warfare Scythe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just as he was about to swing the Warfare Scythe to cut through the mist, his expression suddenly changed, because the transparent coffin he had stored in the Dimensional Space suddenly appeared on its own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the transparent coffin appeared, a gap unexpectedly formed in the pale blue mist, allowing the transparent coffin to fly inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on?" Osborne asked, utterly confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Why did the transparent coffin fly out on its own? Why didn't the pale blue mist stop it but instead opened a gap for it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the moment the gap appeared, Osborne felt an incredibly powerful life force leaking out from the mist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up. Let's follow it inside," Primordial shouted anxiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne acted immediately, with no time to think about why this was happening, as the gap in the mist was quickly closing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, before the gap closed, Osborne rushed into the mist with Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amidst the mist, there was a clearing, empty except for a single oval-shaped egg hovering in the center.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The egg was enormous, at least 33 feet tall. The patterns on the shell shimmered with gold, silver, and blue hues, incredibly intricate, making Osborne feel dizzy just by glancing at it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the transparent coffin was floating near the colorful egg, and the woman inside the coffin seemed to be looking at the egg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, her eyes remained closed, and she hadn't woken up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing such a bizarre scene, Osborne didn't know what to do for a moment and could only look at Primordial again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial knew a lot and probably knew what this colorful egg was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This seems to be the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon!" Primordial suddenly exclaimed, "That's right. Based on this aura and appearance, if I'm not mistaken, it should be the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon. I understand now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I finally understand why Magma Devourer planted so many </span><span>Beast</span><span> Soul Flowers. Magma Devourer belongs to Silicon-based Lifeforms, while Beast Soul Flowers only work on the Beast Clan among Carbon-based Lifeforms. The Beast Soul Flowers planted by Magma Devourer weren't for itself but for the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon about to hatch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I really didn't expect there to be an </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon egg here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but be shocked because he also knew about the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon. The Heavenly Compendium of All Beings contains an introduction to the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon is an extremely rare and nearly extinct special Beast Clan creature. An adult </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon has three heads and six pairs of wings, capable of devouring star cores and quickly annihilating a planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its dragon claws can easily tear apart a star, and its breath can destroy an entire Stellar Region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon, also known as Stellar Destroyer, possesses immense power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in the depths of the universe, </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon is one of the strongest Beast Clan beings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, their numbers are too scarce.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this really an </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon?" Osborne asked in surprise, somewhat doubtful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said, "Yes. You're really lucky. Do you want to keep an </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon as a pet? Even in the depths of the universe, having an </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon as a pet is super cool."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, an </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon will become your powerful ally. If one day you can raise it to adulthood, in the cosmos, apart from those Masters, everyone will hold you in great respect."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne widened his eyes and said, "Keep an </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon as a pet? Are you sure that's even possible? Let's not even talk about whether I can hatch it. Can you guarantee that after I hatch it, it won't just eat me right away?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I heard </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragons are extremely savage and bloodthirsty. Plus, a newborn </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon should already be at Empyrean Sacredness, right? It&rsquo;s stronger than I am the moment it&rsquo;s born. How can you expect me to keep it as a pet? Am I raising it, or is it raising me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> idea was unreliable. The savagery of </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragons is legendary across the universe. They can destroy a planet at any moment, even obliterate an entire Stellar Region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It&rsquo;s practically the embodiment of savagery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's view, such a creature should be destroyed before it fully hatches, rather than given the chance to hatch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, countless lives will be wiped out by it in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smiled faintly. "You don&rsquo;t understand anything. The </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon is indeed powerful, but it&rsquo;s not bloodthirsty. It has destroyed many planets, even numerous Stellar Regions. But it wasn&rsquo;t killing on purpose, it was just trying to feed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You humans destroy ant nests and kill some ants to obtain food. Would you be considered bloodthirsty?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the eyes of an adult </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon, those planets and Stellar Regions are its food, and the creatures on those planets are merely ants to it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial continued, "Moreover, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon is easy to raise. Once it hatches, it will regard the first creature it sees as its mother and remain loyal for life, absolutely obeying its mother's commands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One could say the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon is the best pet in the universe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> words, Osborne instantly became excited. He was convinced by Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "What are we waiting for? Let's hatch it right away."</span></p></div>
