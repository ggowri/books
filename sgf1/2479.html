        <h1>Chapter 2384 The Highest Odds-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up instantly at the sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The 1 to 100 odds were even higher than he expected. Apart from him, the highest odds on the championship betting list were only 1 to 60.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It seems Phantom Commerce Guild doesn't favor me, but that's actually a good thing for me. If they did, how could they offer such high odds?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne couldn't help but feel a burst of joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With 1 to 100 odds, if he bets 100,000 Sacred Crystals and wins the championship, he will earn 10 million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten million Sacred Crystals are enough to buy a very decent mid-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, for Phantom Commerce Guild, ten million Sacred Crystals are nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, you can start betting," the middle-aged man said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his heart, he felt Osborne was just here to give money to the casino. After all, their professional analysis team believed Osborne could at best aim for the top ten, with almost zero chance of winning the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone betting on Osborne to win the championship is essentially giving money to the casino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since it's free money, they naturally won't miss it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and took out all his 170,000 Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hesitating slightly, he turned to Leroy and Clara behind him and said, "How many Sacred Crystals do you have? Lend me some for now. I'll return them in full after the Zone Duel ends."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that betting only Sacred Crystals was really too little.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such an opportunity is rare; he must earn as much profit as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said, "Don't say that. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't even have the chance to be here. I have 120,000 Sacred Crystals; can I give you 100,000? The reason I'm not giving you all of them isn't because I'm unwilling, but because I want to keep some to bet alongside you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly upon hearing this. "Of course, it's a loan! I can't just take your things for free. As for you wanting to bet alongside me, you'd better think it through carefully; after all, there's still some risk involved."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said, "I'm not afraid! If you dare to bet, why wouldn't I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, she took out 100,000 Sacred Crystals and handed them to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara immediately said, "I don't have as much as Leroy; I only have 50,000 Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then lend me 30,000 Sacred Crystals! For the remaining 20,000 Sacred Crystals, just bet alongside me like Leroy," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While making money himself, he naturally wanted to help Leroy and Clara profit as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The premise was that they could trust him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara nodded in agreement, "Alright! But actually, I can also pledge Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she looked at the middle-aged man and asked, "Can Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> be pledged here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man was slightly surprised upon hearing this. "Pledge Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>? Of course! How many points do you have? They can be pledged at a one-to-one ratio!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara gave a faint smile and took out her badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She earned 100 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> in the Sect Tournament, placed second in the City Duel with 9,000 points, and tied for fourth with Leroy in the State Duel, earning 700,000 points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, her badge displayed a total of 791,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "I'll pledge it all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man was stunned upon seeing Clara's badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over 700,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> meant Clara ranked fourth in the State Duel.</span></p></div>
