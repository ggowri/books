        <h1>Chapter 2300 The Seventh Layer-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rematerialized deep within the Arctic Maw Chasm's sixth layer, swiftly locating and pocketing a token tucked away in a shadowy corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another day bites the dust," he murmured, his Sacred Power perpetually at its peak thanks to his Chaotic Spiritual Root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While everyone likely presumed him dead, Osborne was, in reality, having an easier and more comfortable time than anyone else on this layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd grown quite used to the perpetual storms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye, his token-finding speed was unmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd long lost count-had he found a hundred? More?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly, Osborne couldn't be bothered to tally them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If converted to points, his score would be a staggering ten, maybe even twenty million, dwarfing Agatha's top-ranking million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Agatha was sitting on a cool million points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Horace, holding the second-place spot, had racked up 800 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, though, had noticed that Agatha's score hadn't budged in a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What's she up to? Has she hit a dead end and can't find any more tokens? Or did she stumble upon some but just hasn't registered them yet? Maybe she thinks a mil's good enough and has called it quits, or even hightailed it to the seventh layer.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled Agatha grilling Rupert about getting into the seventh layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she had her sights set on something called a Frost-kissed Heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frost-kissed Hearts were no joke. They were like a turbo-boost for one's body and made it a whole lot easier to meld with power. Even the big-wigs at the Empyrean Sacredness level were drooling over these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe Agatha's already in the seventh layer. Should I follow suit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, he'd already amassed more than enough tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he tossed a few Clara's way, they'd both still be in the running for a top-ten finish, or even the first and second spots!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Maybe I should head to the seventh layer. After all, what's the point of racking up tokens if I can't hold onto them? If I'm not strong enough to defend what I've got, I'm just handing someone else the win.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But if I can get </span><span>the </span><span>Frost-kissed Heart and protect my stash... hell, the tokens I've got now could easily land me in the top ten. Maybe even take the whole damn thing.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The temptation was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Frost-kissed Heart&mdash;its ability to enhance the body and streamline power fusion&mdash;was exactly what he needed right now. If Osborne could get his hands on one, his strength would skyrocket. The thought alone sent a thrill through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I've already scoured half of the sixth layer, and there are barely any tokens left. Might as well take a shot at the seventh layer.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne made up his mind.</span><br><span>Seventh layer it is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert's warning about the seventh layer being a death trap for even the most seasoned Empyrean Sacredness warriors lingered in Osborne's mind, but it didn't shake him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything, it fueled his determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Dangerous? Sure. But I've got a trick up my sleeve&mdash;immortality. Even if I bite the dust up there, I can just respawn on the sixth layer. No harm, no foul.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the seventh layer wasn't a gamble&mdash;it was an opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If I don't at least take a shot at finding a Frost-kissed Heart, I'll never forgive myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Agatha's got the guts to go, why the hell shouldn't I?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned on his heel and started making his way back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using Satan's Eye, he navigated the sixth layer with ease, dodging other competitors like a shadow slipping through the cracks. Soon enough, he stood before the Translocator, the gateway to the seventh layer. The cost to activate it? A steep 100 Sacred Crystals.</span></p></div>
