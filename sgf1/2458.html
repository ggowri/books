        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay," Uriah said happily, "let's start now. </span><span>If </span><span>Isidore finds us and stops us from merging with the Elven Mother Tree, it'll be trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Uriah </span><span>turned</span><span> at Hilaria and Sherwood. "Hilaria, Sherwood, let's begin."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They both</span><span> nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the three of them closed their eyes simultaneously and began uttering some peculiar syllables, as if speaking in a special language, like casting spells.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, to Osborne's surprise, he couldn't understand a word they were saying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne's abilities, communicating with any race in the universe was never an issue, even if each race had a different language.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But during communication, it was more about a connection of soul consciousness, with language being secondary and unimportant. So, even if Uriah and the others spoke the language of the elves while Osborne spoke </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> from Blue Planet, there would be no barriers in their communication, allowing them to clearly sense each other's meaning and emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this time, Osborne couldn't understand what Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood were saying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At first, their "spells" didn't cause any changes. However, gradually, Osborne noticed something was off. The energy of Elf City seemed to start shifting and surging, like a calm lake suddenly stirred into ripples. These ripples grew larger and more intense, eventually turning into waves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, with a loud boom, the entire Elf City began to shake. But the biggest change was in the massive Elven Mother Tree not far away. Its branches suddenly started shaking wildly, and the whole tree emitted a bright green glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The light gradually converged into a pillar and then shot toward the sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone in Elf City noticed the anomaly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They stared at the Elven Mother Tree, confused and </span><span>uneasy.</span><span>The</span><span> next second, Isidore's furious roar echoed. "Who is activating the Elven Mother Tree? Who is trying to merge with the Elven Mother Tree? Stop it! Go find the person activating the Elven Mother Tree right now. No matter who it is, kill them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His furious voice echoed throughout Elf City. Instantly, everyone in the Elf Race began searching frantically. Fortunately, Osborne and the other three were in a relatively secluded spot. Moreover, Osborne used the Sublime Concealment Orb to hide their presence. </span><span>For now,</span><span> they didn&rsquo;t have to worry about being discovered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne gradually noticed a powerful force surging within Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood. The power of the Elven Mother Tree seemed to be drawn to them, spreading in their direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this continues, they will be discovered sooner or later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne could do nothing. He could use the Sublime Concealment Orb to hide the power and presence of Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood, but he couldn&rsquo;t conceal the power of the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only pray that the three of them would complete the fusion with the Elven Mother Tree soon and then send him away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, what is the origin of the Elven Mother Tree? Compared to the World Tree, Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and Warfare Ancient Tree, who is stronger?" With nothing else to do, Osborne couldn't help but ask Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial said proudly, "The World Tree is the strongest. It was the first being born in the Chaotic World and is the foundation of the entire world. It holds unmatched power in the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Primordial speechlessly and said, "Are you praising yourself? I haven't noticed that you're stronger than the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and the Warfare Ancient Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial became anxious. "That's because I'm just an offshoot of the World Tree. Moreover, I'm the weakest offshoot. If I can gather the Tree Heart energy of nine offshoots, I can become the true World Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, you'll know how powerful I am. Although the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and the Warfare Ancient Tree are also strong, they can't compare to me. In fact, if it weren't for me providing them energy in the Chaotic World back then, they wouldn't have grown at all. They're like my little brothers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for the Elven Mother Tree... it wasn't born in the Chaotic World but appeared only after the cosmos was created."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Creatures born in the Chaotic World before the cosmos appeared, like the World Tree, </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>Warfare Ancient Tree, are called Primordial Creatures or Primordial Spirit Plants."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Creatures born in the cosmos, like the Elven Mother Tree, are called Acquired Creatures or Acquired Spirit Plants."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In terms of hierarchy, Primordial Creatures are superior to Acquired Creatures and have a higher potential limit. However, Primordial Creatures are not necessarily stronger than Acquired Creatures."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Some weaker Primordial Creatures are similar to powerful Acquired Creatures. However, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and </span><span>the </span><span>Warfare Ancient Tree are top-tier among Primordial Creatures, while the Elven Mother Tree is also top-tier among Acquired Creatures."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I have to tell you who's stronger, it's definitely the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and </span><span>the </span><span>Warfare Ancient Tree. However, the Elven Mother Tree is also very strong. Fortunately, only special individuals from the Elf Race can merge with the Elven Mother Tree. Otherwise, many powerful beings would likely come to seize the Elven Mother Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After listening to Primordial, Osborne roughly understood."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before the cosmos was born, there was a Chaotic World. In the Chaotic World, Primordial Creatures like the World Tree, Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and Warfare Ancient Tree were born."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Afterward, the Chaotic World exploded, giving birth to the cosmos. Various Primordial Creatures either perished or scattered to different corners of the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Over time, creatures were also born in the cosmos, and these creatures were called Acquired Creatures."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Humans, Elf Race, Sacred Dragon Clan, Sacred Tiger Clan, and the Elven Mother Tree are all considered Acquired Creatures."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If an Acquired Creature grows, its power can become as strong as a Primordial Creature, like the Elven Mother Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Mr. Rivera said only Alfreda in Elf City is suitable to merge with the Elven Mother Tree. Once I revive Alfreda, I'll take her back to Elf City, replace Mr. </span><span>Rivera and the other two, and let Alfreda merge with the Elven Mother Tree. By then, Alfreda's strength will surely increase significantly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was somewhat looking forward to how powerful Alfreda would become after merging with the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, something else happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A brilliant emerald light erupted from the Elven Mother Tree, seemingly drawn to Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood. It swiftly enveloped the three, surrounding them in the emerald glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a terrifying power burst forth from the three of them, so overwhelming that even Osborne's Sublime Concealment Orb couldn't hide it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, countless Elf Race warriors were drawn to the emerald light and turned to look, including Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were filled with rage and killing intent as he glared fiercely at Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood. "I found you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You deserve to die for daring to forcibly merge with the Elven Mother Tree. I won't let you succeed. All of you, die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Isidore charged forward madly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this scene, Osborne's expression turned serious. He thought, "We've still been discovered."</span></p></div>
