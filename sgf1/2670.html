        <h1>Chapter 2551 Enemy! Prince Hendrix!-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, curious, immediately walked over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hotel's name was simple, just Empire Hotel. It was run by the Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family and was considered the most luxurious and largest hotel in the Inner City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, countless people were gathered outside the hotel, eagerly looking inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne walked up behind a young man and asked, "Brother, what are you all looking at? This hotel has been here for thousands of years, what's so interesting?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man turned his head upon hearing this and glanced at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The hotel itself isn't much to look at, but the people inside are worth waiting for! Just now, Princess Seraphina went in!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man was very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Seraphina is one of the most beautiful princesses in our Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family! She is as famous as the Crown Prince's wife, Princess Elisha, and both are among the top ten beauties of the Glorious Divine Kingdom!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Seraphina usually stays in the Palace and rarely appears. This time, she finally came out, and everyone is curious to see if Princess Seraphina is really that beautiful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly surprised upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Princess Seraphina...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the memories of his previous life, this person did not exist. There was only one possibility: before he was banished from the Palace, Seraphina had not yet been born.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, is this Princess Seraphina considered his sister?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, he asked, "Brother, I come from a faraway place and this is my first time venturing out. I'm not familiar with Princess Seraphina. How old is she this year?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man looked at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't even know about Princess Seraphina? Where exactly are you from? Princess Seraphina is extraordinarily gifted. She's not even five hundred years old and is already an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King! It's said that she could have broken through to become an Empyrean Sacredness a hundred years ago, but for some reason, she's been suppressing her cultivation level! Otherwise, by now, she might already be a mid Empyrean Sacredness, or even an advanced Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, Princess Seraphina will also participate in this year's Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel! In ten days, we'll get to witness Princess Seraphina's brilliance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man's expression was filled with excitement and anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's not even five hundred years old!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. That made sense&mdash;back in his previous life, when he was exiled from the Palace, it had already been over a thousand years ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was perfectly normal that he had no memory of this Seraphina, who was not even five hundred years old.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This Seraphina has nothing to do with me! She never wronged me, and she's not the one I'm seeking revenge on!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the person continued, "It's said that this time, Princess Seraphina came along with her elder brother&mdash;Prince Hendrix! All the prodigies participating in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel were ultimately arranged to stay at the Empire Hotel. Prince Hendrix, as the seventh prince, seems to be trying to recruit these prodigies!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne stopped in his tracks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression turned extremely grim at that moment, clenching his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prince Hendrix!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seventh Prince!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a deep fury and killing intent flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Hendrix was one of the many princes and princesses who humiliated and tormented him back then, he even personally broke one of Osborne's legs!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's hatred for him was no less than for Brent!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, Princess Seraphina is Prince Hendrix's younger sister! And now they're in this hotel..."</span></p></div>
