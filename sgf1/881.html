        <h1>Chapter 881 No One Challenges</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family erupted into cheers, their excitement palpable as they jumped to their feet, voices ringing out in unison.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just a day ago, most of them had been filled with pessimism. Despite Osborne's victories over Vincent and Emma in the heir selection, securing his position as the first heir of the Augustine family, doubts lingered.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They felt that Osborne's strength paled in comparison to the prodigies on the Godson Rankings. They couldn't fathom why their Godfather would hold an Honor Quest Ceremony for him, believing he simply didn't deserve it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Worry gnawed at them as they feared Osborne wouldn't even manage a ten-win streak. The thought of his Honor Quest Ceremony devolving into a spectacle of humiliation was unbearable. They dreaded the idea of becoming a laughingstock because of him, the subject of ridicule from others.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Osborne first stepped onto the stage, the boos and jeers had stung, making them want to sink into the ground and disappear.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, as Osborne effortlessly defeated Emi with a single move and completed his ten consecutive wins, a wave of relief washed over them. They could finally breathe easy and enjoy the Honor Quest Ceremony without the weight of shame hanging over them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Osborne lost shortly after, at least no one could claim it was a disgraceful event.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And with the way Osborne had performed, how likely was it that he'd lose any time soon?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not a chance!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Cuthbert had needed two moves to defeat Emi, while Osborne had done it in just one. While this didn't necessarily mean Osborne was stronger than Cuthbert, it certainly proved he was no pushover.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert had ultimately achieved an impressive forty-nine consecutive wins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, they hope that Osborne might surpass him and reach fifty.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fifty wins? That's definitely within reach!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The excitement in the Augustine family was electric; fifty wins was no small feat!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Honor Quest Ceremony had a history spanning over two hundred years, and only 63 individuals had ever accomplished fifty consecutive victories.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was right, only sixty-three! With an average of one prodigy every four years, the odds were steep.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of the entire Augustine family, only two had ever reached that milestone&mdash;one of them being Sebastian.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Initially, they had held no expectations for Osborne, but now, the prospect of him vying for fifty wins sent them into a frenzy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those who had once underestimated Osborne, who had worried he'd bring them shame, now gazed at him with fiery enthusiasm, cheering him on with all their might.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Quiet down!" Jackie finally called out, bringing the raucous crowd to a hush.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They didn't want to risk any accusations of stalling for time to give Osborne a breather.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But truth be told, Osborne hadn't exerted himself at all; he didn't need a moment to recover.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let the challenges continue!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After his victory over Emi, the number of challengers dwindled significantly. Emi's defeat had been so decisive that many felt they were no match for her, let alone Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They figured there was no point in stepping up, especially since they couldn't even hope to wear him down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, Rhett, Stuart, Vivian, and Matthew took their turns challenging Osborne, with Vincent reluctantly pushed into the arena by Wesson's insistence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their intentions were clear: they weren't genuinely trying to defeat Osborne or exhaust his strength; they were merely going through the motions, allowing him to rack up more wins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Given their abilities, none of them posed any real threat to Osborne. With the challenges being more of a formality, Osborne breezed through, adding five more wins to his tally.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, once he hit the twenty-win mark, an unexpected silence fell over the arena.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one stepped up to challenge him anymore, and the sudden stillness caused the Augustine family to furrow their brows in concern.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, all the challengers facing Osborne were not ranked in the Godson Rankings. Only after they had their turn would the real monsters from the rankings step up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These opponents would be even tougher, making it far more challenging for Osborne to secure his wins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was then that he would truly face the test of his skills.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family was hopeful that Osborne could rack up more consecutive victories before confronting the top-ranked contenders, allowing him a smoother path to reach that coveted fifty-win streak.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But suddenly, the arena fell silent&mdash;no one stepped up to challenge him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was a disadvantage for Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It meant that if he wanted to complete his fifty wins, he'd need to defeat thirty ranked monsters in a row.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In contrast, Cuthbert had already amassed his thirty wins before facing any ranked challengers, leaving him with just twenty to go.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear who had the tougher road ahead.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family grew anxious, wishing they could leap into the arena themselves to help Osborne secure those vital extra wins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, they lacked the credentials, as only those ranked Class AAA or higher could challenge him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there really no one left to challenge?" Jackie asked repeatedly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the silence persisted, he said, "Alright then. Since no one's stepping up, it's time to follow the rules. The Godson Rankings challengers from Blue Planet will begin their challenges in order of their ranks."</p></div>
