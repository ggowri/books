        <h1>Chapter 2242 The Disheartened Angela-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, every peak took the tournament extremely seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was no exception, keeping a close eye on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in the past two tournaments, not a single disciple from Peak Seven had managed to make it into the top </span><span>twenty</span><span>, let alone the top </span><span>ten</span><span>. This had been a major source of humiliation for her, which was why she'd mostly taken a backseat in overseeing matters this year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the tournament was fast approaching, Angela just couldn't hold back her curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Angela was seated at the head of the table, with a dozen Elders from Peak Seven on either side of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were locked on Earvin. "Earvin, the Sect Tournament is about to start. How's Peak Seven preparing? Show me the list of participants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earvin quickly stepped forward, presenting a scroll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen, here's the list of contestants for you to take a look at!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela skimmed through the names in a flash, but her expression suddenly stiffened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It darkened when she came across a particular entry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, Mystic Sirius Sect, Peak Seven!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also three other inner disciples on the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's annoyance reached a boiling point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you kidding me? We've got over a hundred core disciples, all at Ascension Ten, and we can't even come up with thirty participants? Four inner disciples are going to compete in the Sect Tournament?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earvin's face dropped. He was well aware that the core disciples were reluctant to sign up, but there was precious little he could do to change the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowing his head, he kept quiet under Angela's probing gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of helplessness washed over Angela.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was worried that Peak Seven was going to make a fool of themselves in this tournament yet again, probably repeating the dismal performance of the past two tournaments&mdash;no one in the top </span><span>twenty</span><span>, not even the top </span><span>ten</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of this potential failure bore heavily on her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela finally said, waving her hand nonchalantly, "Never mind! The list has already been submitted, and there's no going back. Let's just hope someone can pull off a surprise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her words, Angela harbored little real hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew most of the inner disciples quite well, and although a few of them had some talent, they were no match for the disciples from the other eight peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Making it into the top twenty, let alone the top ten seemed like an insurmountable task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go and check out the situation!" Angela announced, leading the Elders of Peak Seven towards the arena where the tournament was set to take place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they approached the arena, the atmosphere buzzed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mystic Sirius Sect boasted over a million inner disciples and thousands of core disciples, and nearly all of them had gathered near the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the nine peaks, only the reigning champion, Peak One, had forty slots for participants, while the others were limited to thirty each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, 280 contestants were set to compete, almost all core disciples at Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their formidable strength was palpable as they waited in their designated areas for the tournament to officially begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone in the crowd exclaimed, "Look over there! That's Bethan Tierney from Peak Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten years ago, she placed third in the Sect Tournament! She went on to represent Mystic Sirius Sect in the Tempest Fortress City </span><span>city</span><span> duel, making it into the top ten there and even competing in the state duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True, she took a hard hit in the state duel, but she's determined to come back stronger this time and achieve an even better result!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's definitely improved since then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think she has a real shot at the top spot in this tournament!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with excitement, pointing at the serene figure of Bethan, who was meditating with her eyes closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A doubter scoffed, saying, "Pfft, aiming for first place? Fat chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She came in third last tournament, and I seriously doubt she'll break that streak this time. And don't forget, Jamar Bacall from Peak Three, who got second last time, and Vadim </span><span>Wilkens</span><span> from Peak One, the champion, have both leveled up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're </span><span>gonna</span><span> fight tooth and nail to keep their titles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's a safe bet those three will snag the top spots again. Anyone else trying to muscle in is just spinning their wheels!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold your horses, though! What if a dark-horse competitor shows up?" retorted someone.</span></p></div>
