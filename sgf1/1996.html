        <h1>Chapter 1993 The Human Community Had Lost-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the battle began, everyone knew that the border competition between the Human Community and the Unity Clan was going to be brutal. People would die on the arena, no doubt about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were all wrong about one thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected the competition to be this savage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a fight&mdash;it was a bloodbath, a battle to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a war for the honor and survival of entire races. There was only one way to win: wipe out every single enemy. And there was only one way to lose: fall on that arena and stay there, unable to move, until your last breath left your body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though only 20,000 Transcendent Deities were fighting here&mdash;tiny compared to the hundreds of billions in both armies&mdash;it was still a massacre. These 20,000 were practically cannon fodder on the grand stage of the war, and to the high-ranking figures watching, they were nothing more than ants. Their power, compared to the true powerhouses, seemed laughably weak, like kids throwing punches in a schoolyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when the battle actually kicked off, the air grew heavy with tension. Every face in the crowd darkened, and every eye locked onto the fighters, feeling the raw determination coming off the warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screams, the roars, the blood...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible not to clench your fists as you watched them either explode their enemies or have their own bodies shattered into pieces. The brutality of it all weighed down on every single spectator, a heavy, uncomfortable pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Imagine this fight, but ten thousand times bigger," one observer muttered. "The final showdown between the Human Community and the Unity Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brutal. Bloody."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all or nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the hundreds of billions in armies watching from the sidelines fell completely silent. Every eye was fixed on the viewing platform above, where a mere 20,000 warriors were fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those 20,000 were rapidly dwindling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty thousand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eighteen thousand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen thousand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten thousand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five thousand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three thousand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The viewing platform, spanning 300 miles, was more than large enough to accommodate the battle. At first, the two sides fought in clusters, but as more warriors fell, the chaos escalated. Every corner of the platform was erupting in bloody skirmishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One Human Community genius, drenched in blood, rammed his longsword deep into an enemy's chest, only to have his head severed by another enemy the very next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of Unity Clan elites surrounded a dozen or so Human Community geniuses. Then, in an instant, the Human Community fighters chose to self-destruct, taking everyone with them in a fiery explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood, severed limbs, heads, shattered weapons...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos flooded the viewing platform. Amid the roar of the battle, the fighting slowly died down. When the dust settled, fewer than 2,000 remained standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest, nearly 18,000 warriors, were either lifeless or reduced to unrecognizable piles of ash and bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those 2,000 standing tall? Every single one of them was covered in blood, their bodies torn apart...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all Unity Clan elites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the Human Community's 10,000 Transcendent Deity geniuses had wiped out over 8,000 Unity Clan fighters&mdash;but at the cost of their entire army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in that moment, even the Dark Deity Legion of Unity Clan didn't cheer. They stood there, staring at the blood-soaked silhouettes of the surviving warriors on the viewing platform, their faces filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle between Transcendent Deities could be this intense?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before it ended, no one had dared to assume that Unity Clan would come out on top. Even after the battle was over, with the outcome clear, the Dark Deity Legion didn't celebrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because it had been too horrific. Too brutal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they were soldiers, warriors who had fought in countless battles, most of the time, when two forces collided, it was all about getting in a few good hits and retreating if things got too rough.</span></p></div>
