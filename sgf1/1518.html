        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke up, "In this Dimensional Bag, there are 4.15 million mid-grade Essence Crystals. Please count them! And when you do, could you get in touch with the Gellar family? Have them deliver that Ultimate Malevolence Airship directly to Spark Estate and hand it over to a woman named Betty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Hannah took the Dimensional Bag, her expression turned from shock to skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you serious? You're not worried that I might just take your Essence Crystals and skip out on sending the airship?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're talking about 500 million Essence Crystals here! For any major faction among the hundred races, that's enough to tempt someone to go to extremes&mdash;even to eliminate a loose end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged with a confident smile. "I trust you! And I have faith in your Mystic Feather Clan and the Gellar family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your family is the only one willing to protect the Human Community among all the hundred races. If spending 500 million Essence Crystals helps me test your clan's loyalty and your family's commitment, I think it's worth it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah stood there, momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she nodded. "Alright! You can count on us; the Gellar family won't let you down! We do need Essence Crystals desperately right now, so I won't hold back. I'll gladly accept these, and I'll contact my grandfather right away to ensure that Ultimate Malevolence Airship makes its way to Spark Estate immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she poured the Essence Crystals from Osborne's Dimensional Bag into her own before handing it back to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks! These Essence Crystals will really help the Gellar family out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "I should be thanking you! Even if I hadn't agreed to buy your Malevolence Airship, the other factions would have jumped at the chance. But I doubt anyone else would sell me an Ultimate Malevolence Airship aside from you guys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that I'll have that airship, the folks at Spark of Blaze are going to feel a lot safer. Even if a Deity Overlord warrior lays siege to Spark Estate and our divine power defense can't hold, having that airship will let us get away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So really, it's me who owes you! And as for that Deathborn in your Essence Crystal mine, consider it handled&mdash;no charge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah chuckled, clearly amused. "Were you planning to charge me for it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. He hadn't really thought about charging her; truthfully, he had briefly considered helping himself to some Essence Crystals from the Gellar family's mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had let that idea slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ultimate Malevolence Airship boasted an impressive speed, covering 300 thousand miles in an hour, making it nearly impossible for even a Deity Overlord warrior to catch up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Gellar family's Essence Crystal mine lay just over 100 thousand miles from Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without pushing the airship to its limits, they arrived near the Gellar family's Essence Crystal mine within an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The landscape unfolded to reveal a sprawling range of mountains that seemed to stretch on for miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is all of this the Gellar family's mining territory?" Osborne asked, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah laughed. "Not at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should know that there are twelve large Essence Crystal mining districts surrounding Wild Flame City, and they all belong to the Wild Flame Army, the City Guard, and the City Lord's Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be honest, that's not entirely accurate. There's a thirteenth mining area right here in front of us, and it's much larger than the other twelve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This area, known as the No. 13 mining area, is jointly owned by the three major Upper Races in Wild Flame City&mdash;the Demonic Dragon Clan, Soaring Lion Clan, and Mystic Feather Clan. This territory has been divided into over a hundred zones, where each major faction or family can have their own mining rights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Gellar family controls mining rights in Zone 8, which is over there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah pointed in a specific direction as the Malevolence Airship glided toward the designated area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zone 8 is considered one of the more prosperous mining areas here! Each section has different levels of Essence Crystal deposits, and they are ranked by number&mdash;the lower the number, the more abundant the deposits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The strongest races and factions get to choose first. The Mystic Feather Clan ranks second among the three Upper Races; we're slightly weaker than the Demonic Dragon Clan but stronger than the Soaring Lion Clan. As for us, the Gellar family ranks third within the Mystic Feather Clan, which put us eighth in line to choose, so we selected Zone 8.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, the top 20 zones in the No. 13 mining area all produce top-grade Essence Crystals, and the richer the area, the more top-grade you can count on finding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's explanation left Osborne utterly amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are top-grade Essence Crystals here? I thought only the No. 9 mining area around Wild Flame City was known for that! Are you telling me the top 20 zones here are all producing the top quality? Is this place really more lucrative than No. 9?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up with intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah, unaware of Osborne's intentions, nodded in affirmation. "Oh, it's definitely more bountiful than No. 9! In fact, around nine out of ten top-grade Essence Crystals from Wild Flame City come from this area."</span></p></div>
