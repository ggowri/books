        <h1>Chapter 2657 The Artifact Soul of the Apocalypse Bow-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at the Apocalypse Bow, completely unable to think of any solution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't even channel his Sacred Power into the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in his hands, the Apocalypse Bow felt like an ordinary stone, perhaps even less than a stone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the material of the Apocalypse Bow was incredibly unique.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was covered in scars, with the largest one seemingly capable of breaking the Apocalypse Bow at any moment, no matter how hard Osborne tried, the Apocalypse Bow remained unbelievably sturdy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's immense strength couldn't budge the Apocalypse Bow at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This shows that the Apocalypse Bow is far from ordinary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right, I can ask Primordial," Osborne said. He suddenly remembered that he was no longer in the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Celestial Spire, he couldn't contact Primordial or the Warfare Ancient Tree. However, now that he had left the Celestial Spire, their communication was no longer restricted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perhaps Primordial and the Warfare Ancient Tree have a solution." Thinking this, Osborne immediately called out to Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Primordial appeared on Osborne's shoulder, yawning. "What do you need me for? Why did I just fall asleep? I haven't slept so comfortably in ages."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne rolled his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial hadn't just fallen asleep; it was suppressed by the power of the Celestial Spire, which forcibly put it into a state of slumber.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Osborne explain the situation, Primordial was stunned. "That's impossible. I'm an offshoot of a World Tree. Even though my cultivation level isn't high, how could I be forcibly suppressed and put into a slumber? Where is that Celestial Spire?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pointed above their heads.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial looked up and was stunned, a look of fear appearing in its eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked in surprise, "Do you know the Celestial Spire?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shook its head and said gravely, "I don't know it, but I feel it's terrifying and could easily crush us all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course." Osborne rolled his eyes, feeling a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I had hoped Primordial could recognize the Celestial Spire. But I was wrong. There's no record of the Celestial Spire in Primordial's memory either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Primordial was very interested in the Celestial Spire and kept asking questions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly explained the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was shocked again and said seriously, "This Celestial Spire is extraordinary. Its level might even surpass that of a Sovereign Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned. "The Celestial Spire's level is higher than a Sovereign Artifact? That's impossible. Isn't the Sovereign Artifact the strongest in the cosmos?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're right," Primordial said calmly. "In the cosmos, the Sovereign Artifact is indeed the strongest. But what if this Celestial Spire isn't from the cosmos?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned. "Are you talking about the Umbra World?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded. "It's possible, but I'm not sure. However, based on your description, this Celestial Spire is at least a Sovereign Artifact, maybe even more powerful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial continued, "Forget it, don't think about it. Even if it's a Sovereign Artifact, you can't control it now. There's a huge gap between you and it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and said calmly, "How is that possible? I already have two Sovereign Artifacts. One is the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear, and the other is the Apocalypse Bow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial sneered, "How can they be called Sovereign Artifacts? They've been wrecked and can at most unleash power comparable to an Imperial Artifact now. I suggest you throw away such trash."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Especially that Apocalypse Bow. How can it be called the Supremacy Bow of the Cosmos? I've never even heard of it. I think it's fake. Otherwise, how could it show no reaction at all? It doesn't dare to react. If it does, it will be exposed."</span></p></div>
