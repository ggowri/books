        <h1>Chapter 1407 Landscape of Celestara</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's calm voice caught Harry and Amelia off guard, leaving them utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, we can't die? Osborne, do you have a plan or something?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I missing something here? We're trapped! The entire mining area must be sealed off by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only is it impossible for us to survive outside the mine, but if we manage to escape, we'd be immediately ambushed by the Ninth Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even hiding deep within the mine won't save us; they'll track us down slowly using the Spirit Tracer. We're out of options!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's words dripped with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, his expression unfazed, "If the Ninth Dark Deity Legion were truly as powerful as you think, then there wouldn't be any Deathborn haunting East Zone Nine. This place would have already turned into their personal paradise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So don't worry. I'm not playing games with my life. I'm here to protect you both and ensure you live! Your future will be much brighter&mdash;no more being slaves or miners for the Legion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia stared at him, mouths agape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They struggled to process Osborne's claims, but the confidence radiating from his relaxed demeanor started to influence them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the depths of their hopelessness, a flicker of hope began to resurface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry urged, "Osborne, what exactly is your plan? How can we help you? If there's a way out of this and we can escape being slaves to the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, who in their right mind wouldn't want to take it? We're all in if there's even a hint of hope."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered for a moment before responding, "I don't have a full plan just yet, but I've got some ideas. What I really need is more information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry, tell me about East Zone Nine and the whole situation in Celestara. That'll help me make the right calls."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry looked taken aback. "East Zone Nine? And Celestara? Osborne, have you really lost your memory?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose, resisting the urge to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't fully trust Harry and Amelia yet, so he wouldn't reveal that he wasn't actually from Celestara but from Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Harry and Amelia didn't pry further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry admitted. "Well, as for Celestara, I don't know much either. I was born in East Zone Nine, right here in the mining district, and I've never set foot outside of it. A lot of what I know is just hearsay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you need the info, I can share what I do know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Just tell me what you know, even if it's second-hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry took a breath and began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! This area spans several million miles to the east of Celestara. The whole of Celestara is divided into the East Zone, West Zone, South Zone, North Zone, and Central Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celestara is vast&mdash;just the East Zone alone could cover millions of square miles, maybe even more! There are ten Divine Peaks in the East Zone, and we divide this area based on those peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Peak Nine is located right here, which is why this place is known as East Zone Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The East Zone Nine comprises three mega-cities, hundreds of large cities, and thousands of medium and small-sized cities, along with countless towns and villages. Yet, despite my age, I haven't visited a single one, not even the smallest city."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia's eyes were downcast as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the East Zone Nine, the Ninth Dark Deity Legion rules supreme. Each city's guards also wield significant power. The only force that can pose a threat to the Legion is the Deathborn army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beyond the cities, except for specific mining areas, the Deathborn dominate. Humans here either submit to the Legion and serve or end up like us&mdash;slaves and miners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humans are at the bottom of the heap here, and even across the entire East Zone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry sighed, his voice tinged with longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I envy those born in the West Zone. From what I hear, human resistance still controls it. Everything there is run by humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion hasn't broken through yet. The human resistance holds most of the West Zone. If we were born there, we could live and train normally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or if we could somehow escape to the West Zone, we wouldn't have to fear the Legion chasing us down," he said, his eyes filled with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "The West Zone? You mean, the West Zone of Celestara is still under human control?"</span></p></div>
