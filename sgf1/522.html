        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His first impression of Owen was quite favorable. He saw him as a humble individual from a noble family who wasn't arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now it appeared that Owen faked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he seemed humble at first was that he hadn't taken Osborne seriously. However, when he realized that Osborne was more formidable and even a threat, his true nature began to show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to kill Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly. After fighting Owen for so long, he could sense that Owen was genuinely powerful. Even now, Owen had yet to reveal his full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Owen's attempt to kill him was impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're taking this seriously, I'll match your intensity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and decided to expose all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also possessed numerous hidden skills, including Satan's Eye, Deadly Force, Vampire Transformation, Breath of Celestial, Thunderbolt Scepter, and Death Sickle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Owen couldn't be defeated, he was confident he could still catch him off guard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Owen, ready to burst out with all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen sneered and prepared to strike Osborne with the three bolts of ball lightning in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a tremendous amount of energy suddenly enveloped their area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Owen, standing opposite him, was instantly stunned and immobilized. Even the ball lightning in his hands quickly dissipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all family. There's no need to keep fighting. If you have energy to spare, it's better to save it for our real enemies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An old voice abruptly echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen exclaimed in surprise, "Caleb! Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb Augustine promptly appeared between Osborne and Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, seemingly in his seventies or eighties, was remarkably energetic. He glanced at Owen and then at Osborne with a beam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am here for something very important."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Osborne and said, "You must be Osborne Augustine, heir of the Augustine family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Caleb Augustine, an elder of the Augustine family in Newport City. You've impressed me, and I hold high hopes for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Caleb finished speaking, Osborne did not respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept his gaze fixed on Caleb and his mind filled with vague suspicions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Caleb was so polite to Osborne, Owen frowned immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden, unsettling premonition struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked through gritted teeth, "Caleb, you just mentioned that we are all family. What does that mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb replied calmly, "Literally!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this is why I came here! After years of investigation, I've confirmed that the Augustine family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> is a branch of our family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, it is the ninth branch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is a member of our family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb's statement shocked Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn quickly looked at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> is a branch of our family? Osborne is one of us?" Owen murmured incredulously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caleb, could you be mistaken? No one in the entire Augustine family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> has activated Satan's Eye, the Augustine family's inherited power. How could they be a branch of our family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn also asked, "Exactly! How could Osborne be a member of our branch family? If so, does that mean he's my relative?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb smiled, "Of course, I can't be mistaken! The Augustine family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> descended from our family hundreds of years ago. We lost contact due to war, and, for some reason, they couldn't activate the Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But they are definitely a branch of our family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is confirmed by the Godfather. If you have any doubts, feel free to ask him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Caleb finished speaking, Owen and Evelynn were suddenly filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ask the Godfather?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being direct descendants of the Augustine family in Newport City, they still felt intimidated in the presence of the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They glanced at each other with dark faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb ignored them and grinned at Osborne, saying, "Osborne, are you willing to have the Augustine family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> return and make them the ninth branch of the Augustine family in Newport City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his eyebrows and paused before responding, thinking quickly, "It seems my sixth succession test is in Newport City! To conceal the fact that I'm his grandson, the Godfather arranged for me to assume the identity of a branch family member and go back to the Augustine family in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that the Augustine family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> may actually be a branch of the </span><span>Augustine family in Newport City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since it is arranged by the Godfather, I have no reason to refuse. Perhaps the moment I agree, my sixth succession test will begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied, "Caleb, I'm truly sorry. This news is quite shocking. As the heir of the Augustine family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, I can't make a decision on my own, though.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to gather the other family members and discuss it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb nodded with a smile. "No problem. It is reasonable."</span></p></div>
