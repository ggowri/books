        <h1>Chapter 457 The Power of the Energy Pistol</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Wade were both feared at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Osborne as if they were looking at a devil, an invincible devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had already used up all their strength and launched the most potent attack. But Osborne just used his martial art aura and blocked all their attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made them almost despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! It's impossible! You must have some powerful defensive ancient magic weapon!" roared Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't believe that it was Osborne's own strength. He couldn't accept the enormous gap between him and Osborne. He would rather believe that Osborne did it by relying on some kind of defensive ancient magic weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "You can think that way. After all, you will be dead soon. Letting you be happy before you die is my kindness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne punched out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still did not use any advanced martial arts skills, just a pure burst of strength. Alexander and Wade were highly terrified and frantically activated lightning defenses to block Osborne's punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them were blown away, bleeding wildly, and fell heavily on the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wade!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Paltrow family couldn't help but be horrified when they saw this situation now. They attacked frantically, trying to stop Osborne from killing Alexander and Wade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all were powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least those who dared to take action were at least Class B+ or Class A- in strength, and among them was Robert, a Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were dozens of people in total, and they attacked Osborne frantically now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted. Just as he was about to make a move, he suddenly thought of the pistol that Godfather had rewarded him with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I can try out the power of that pistol now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne took out the pistol from the Dimensional Space and held it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked like an ordinary pistol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isa had said that it could actually be considered a magic weapon, a magic weapon made with modern technology. It did not shoot out physical bullets but compressed the user's energy into the shape of a bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had no magazine, just an energy compression device.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne separated a small amount of energy from the martial art aura and poured it into the energy compression device of the pistol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne aimed at a Class B+ elite of the Paltrow family and pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's marksmanship was definitely at the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, it was almost impossible for him to make a mistake. An energy bullet shot out from the muzzle at a breakneck speed and instantly reached that man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was full of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Osborne actually fired at me with a pistol? I'm a Class B+ martial artist. I can ignore even large-caliber shells, let alone pistols."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That man didn't take any hot weapons seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With disdain in his eyes, he had no intention of dodging at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't dodge it, in fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of the energy bullet was so fast that the moment Osborne fired the shot, the energy bullet had already arrived and instantly pierced that man's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trembled and stopped instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a bloody hole on his head, and blood mixed with brains quickly flowed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he fell heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne killed a Class B+ metahuman with just one shot, and the energy consumed by Osborne was almost insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was delighted, thinking, "It's quite powerful! It can easily penetrate the body of a Class B+ martial artist. Let's try it on a Class A- martial artist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instantly locked onto another Class A- martial artist and fired three shots at him in succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, three bloody holes appeared on that man's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy bullets instantly pierced his head. His brains and blood flowed out of the bloody holes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was really surprised now. The power of this energy pistol was much stronger than he had imagined. Its penetrating power was so terrifying that even the strong body of a Class A- martial artist could not block it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps, it's because my energy is too strong," murmured Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy strength of the user determined the power of this energy pistol. The stronger Osborne's energy was, the more powerful it would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy that Osborne had poured into the energy pistol was a fusion of his martial art aura and the sixth-level Devil's Light. Even Wade's attack could not break it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, the power of the energy pistol was so terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was in high spirits, so he injected energy into the pistol again and aimed at Robert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert was a Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Class A martial master had an extremely strong body, comparable to the most rigid steel. He even had a martial art aura that could defend his entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "If the energy pistol can penetrate even Robert's defense, it will be amazing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he pulled the trigger repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy bullets arrived in front of Robert instantly. Robert's expression was solemn. He did not dare to be careless. He burst out the martial art aura to protect his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy bullets hit his martial art aura instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Robert's martial art aura was pierced, and several blood holes appeared on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His blood spurted out.</span></p></div>
