        <h1>Chapter 2031 Strike</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could see the gravity etched on the God of Light's face, but there was no hint of panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that the God of Light had a way to break the seal of Ninefold Heaven's Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He directly asked, "How long will it take you to break the seal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light replied quickly, "Ten minutes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've battled the Nine Dark Sovereigns numerous times and am quite familiar with Ninefold Heaven's Tower. My Sanctum of Light is slightly superior in rank, but we're still in the same league. I can break the seal, but it will take around ten minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Ten minutes, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That should be enough time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light looked at Osborne with surprise. "What do you mean by 'should be enough'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, choosing not to elaborate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a booming laugh echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, it's been a while! Has it been thirty years since our last encounter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, eight figures materialized before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Eight Dark Sovereigns!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the elite among the Paramount Supreme Clan, they were Lord Malevolence's most formidable allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no names, only codenames&mdash;ranging from Icy One to Icy Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiding behind the God of Light, Osborne was seeing Icy One's true form for the first time. Instantly, he activated Satan's Eye, revealing Icy One's cultivation level with clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Indeed, an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Two through Icy Six are all Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings, while Icy Seven and Icy Eight are Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light snorted, saying, "Icy One, you're asking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After our last battle, you're still bold enough to show your face here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One smirked. "God of Light, I admit I can't take you on in a one-on-one fight, but you won't be able to kill me either! We all know each other too well for empty threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're aware of my purpose for being here, and you can't stop me! This time, we will strike together to eliminate the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! And let's not forget that traitor from Mystic Feather Clan&mdash;Hannah!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They all must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a terrifying killing intent radiated from Icy One, his eyes locked onto Osborne and Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure was suffocating; even with the God of Light standing in front of them, they felt as if a mountain was pressing down on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces paled, and Osborne felt an overwhelming sense of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So this is the power of an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King? It's truly terrifying! Just the force of his aura makes me feel paralyzed. I'm nowhere near his level yet! Fortunately, his opponent is the God of Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light let out another cold snort and said, "Icy One, you're far too arrogant! You think you can kill the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings right in front of me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be dreaming! Did you really think I wouldn't anticipate your move? Did you think I'd come unprepared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the God of Light clapped his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a thousand Supernal Deity Kings appeared, forming a protective barrier around Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light said, "Want to kill the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings? You're not ready for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One wore a cold smile. "So you've gathered a thousand Supernal Deity Kings to protect them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to admit, God of Light, your preparations are impressive! But do you really think that will be enough to stop us from taking them down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're being naive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've brought help, and I have my own plans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy One clapped his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, countless figures emerged from the darkness, each exuding an overwhelming aura, their eyes glinting with a chilling killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of them were Supernal Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another thousand of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy One, have you lost your mind? You Eight Dark Sovereigns come to take down the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, and now you bring along a thousand Supernal Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you worried they might not make it back? If they fall here, how will you explain that to Lord Malevolence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One burst into laughter. "Explain? Don't be ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They won't die here. But even if they did, it would be worth it just to eliminate the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately for you, you won't be able to kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned his gaze to Osborne with a smirk of disdain. "Osborne, I have to admit, your talent is impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community, in their youth, couldn't compare to you! On the arena stage, you've caused quite a bit of trouble for us in the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give credit where it's due; under fair conditions, even we, the noble Paramount Supreme Clan, struggle against you. But let's be real&mdash;this world doesn't operate on fair rules. If we can't settle this on the stage, we'll settle it off the stage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you ready to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "To receive such praise from you is quite an honor! But if you think taking down the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings will be easy, you might want to think again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh really? Let's put that to the test!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy One's eyes gleamed with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't waste any more time. It's time to send you on your way! Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, chaos erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One launched a powerful strike at Osborne, a terrifying wave of dark energy hurtling towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the sheer force of the darkness bearing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his Infinite Sacred Body, he doubted he could withstand it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne didn't falter in fear or panic. Just as the dark energy was about to strike, a brilliant light flared up in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the light consumed the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the God of Light stepping in. "Icy One, as long as I'm here, you won't lay a finger on him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One, unfazed, seemed to have anticipated this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's have a real battle! Icy Two, Icy Three, Icy Four, Icy Five, you're with me against the God of Light! Icy Six, Icy Seven, Icy Eight, go take out the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a ferocious battle erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One and his four allies charged at the God of Light, unleashing a torrent of devastating attacks that quickly enveloped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight rushed toward Osborne and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thousand Supernal Deity Kings surrounding Osborne were there to protect him, and they couldn't just stand by while he was in danger. They sprang into action, ready to defend him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, the thousand Supernal Deity Kings brought by Icy One launched their own assault, swiftly entangling Osborne and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight were upon Osborne and his companions, their intentions clear.</span></p></div>
