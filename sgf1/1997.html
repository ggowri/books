        <h1>Chapter 1993 The Human Community Had Lost-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, on this viewing platform, only 300 miles across, there was no retreat. No one was surrendering. No one was backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing on their minds was eliminating the enemy&mdash;by any means necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it meant biting through their own teeth. Even if it meant self-detonation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We lost the first round..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the Sanctum of Light's factions stood in stunned silence, their faces heavy with grief. Most of the Human Community warriors who had died on that platform came from their own ranks&mdash;many were their own children, nieces, nephews, and younger generations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were all gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they hadn't brought shame to the Human Community. They fought until the bitter end, and they had a real shot at victory...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, all of them were dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first border competition for the Human Community... lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And for Unity Clan? It was a hollow victory. A brutal, bloody win that didn't feel like winning at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, everyone felt like their throats had closed up, their eyes starting to burn with a red haze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that losing 10,000 Transcendent Deities wasn't the end of the world. It wasn't even that big of a deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a thousand years, they had faced losses a hundred times, even a thousand times worse, just trying to hold their ground against the Dark Deity Legion. They'd seen unimaginable horrors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time... this time was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, they watched with their own eyes as the 10,000 Human Community Transcendent Deities, despite pushing themselves to the absolute limit, still lost. Lost the battle. Lost their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every leader stood with a grave expression. Sure, it was just one battle, but from this one battle, it was clear: the gap between the Human Community and Unity Clan wasn't just theoretical&mdash;it was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what made it worse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unity Clan hadn't even unleashed their full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of the geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clans had been deployed. In fact, even among the Upper Race, the number of elites sent to fight had been shockingly low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, despite all that, the Human Community still lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the battle, the leaders of the various factions had been full of confidence, but now, they couldn't even muster the strength to speak. They just stood there, in heavy silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, your Human Community just lost the first round," Icy One's voice rang out, cold and mocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled. "Your warriors have courage, I'll give you that. Too bad they're lacking a bit in the power department. I didn't even need to send my real geniuses from the Dark Deity Legion, and we still wiped the floor with you. According to the rules, for every round you lose, your defenses have to fall back by a million kilometers. So, we've only lost 8,000 Transcendent Deities, but we're pushing forward a million kilometers. Seems like a pretty good trade, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The taunting words sent a wave of fury through every Human Community member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span>'s lips curled into a tight sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy One, don't get too cocky," she shot back, her voice ice-cold. "This is just the beginning. The fight isn't over yet, and who wins and who loses is still up in the air. By the end of the day, maybe you will be the ones retreating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha ha ha!" Icy One let out a loud, mocking laugh. "Really? If you think your Human Community has what it takes, then prove it! You want us to fall back? You think you can make that happen? You lowly Human Community scum, do you really think you stand a chance? You better hope you don't lose all eight of today's matches. If that happens, I'll be laughing my ass off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Dark Deity Legion finally snapped out of their stunned silence, erupting into cruel, mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha ha ha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha ha ha ha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic Human Community, is that all your so-called geniuses are capable of? Don't embarrass yourselves any more than you already have! You actually think you're worthy of challenging us? You're just signing your own death warrant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, we're pushing forward eight million kilometers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, we'll win all eight rounds!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their fierce shouts made every Human Community warrior's face darken. But there was nothing they could say in response; after all, they had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk!" </span><span>God of Light</span><span> snapped. "Let's get back to it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next round&mdash;Celestial Deity level match!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's begin!"</span></p></div>
