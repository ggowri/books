        <h1>Chapter 1894 Mila's Parents</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing Jethro unleash the Gale of Netherworld firsthand, the gap in power was strikingly clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's Universe-Sealing Formation was undeniably formidable, but in terms of sheer might, it paled in comparison to Jethro's awe-inspiring technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One day, I'll become that strong! And it won't take long! With enough Miracle Elixirs, I can make massive strides in my power!" he mused, excitement bubbling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The longing to set forth surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although being with the Hudson family stirred the warmth of home within his heart, the drive to enhance his strength overshadowed everything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their situation was precarious, and he knew he needed to grow stronger to protect them. When disaster struck, he wanted to stand proudly in front of the Hudson family, a shield against impending harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, we're ready to head out!" Osborne announced, but he saw a flicker of reluctance in Jethro's and Zachary's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the fondness lingered, departure was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, Osborne! I have a few questions," Mila suddenly interjected, stepping forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She approached Jethro, offering a respectful bow. "Can I ask if you've ever heard of the Immemorial Tower?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Immemorial Tower?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's brows furrowed, a look of confusion washing over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he shook his head, saying, "I can't say I have! Is it a certain faction? Why do you ask about it, little Mila?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shared Mila's curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila bit her lip, a frown creasing her brow. "What about the Sacred Eagle? Or the Sacred Sparrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah?" Now, Jethro's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Sacred Eagle and the Sacred Sparrow? I think I've definitely heard something about them. Let me see... Where did I come across that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fell into a thoughtful silence, trying to piece together the fragments of memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila's eyes sparkled with excitement and anticipation as she gazed at Jethro, hanging on his every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sidled up next to her and gently ruffled her hair. "Mila, what's all this about? Why are you asking these questions?" he inquired, his voice laced with warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila bit her lip before finally speaking up, "Osborne, the Sacred Eagle and the Sacred Sparrow are my parents! The Immemorial Tower is the faction they belonged to. Before Lord Malevolence invaded, I lived happily with my parents in the Immemorial Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything was perfect until my father suddenly predicted a great calamity was coming to Celestara. They told Divine Shadow to take me away to the east of Celestara while they stayed behind to confront the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know what happened next. Not long after, Divine Shadow and I were attacked by the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was captured, and Divine Shadow fell into a coma. Eventually, that area was severed and sealed by the God of Space, turning into the Blue Planet. We fell asleep there until we finally woke up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that I'm back in Celestara, I want to find my parents! I need to find the Immemorial Tower! It's a powerful place, and if it still exists, it must be one of the top factions in the Human Community. But from what I've gathered, there's no sign of the Immemorial Tower among the top factions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Mila's lips tightened in worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so worried about my parents!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a frown creasing his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "So, Mila's been searching for her parents all along but hasn't said a word about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immemorial Tower? Sacred Eagle and Sacred Sparrow? Does Grandpa know anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Jethro, hoping for some comforting news that could help Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro said, his expression shifting to one of recollection, "I remember now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have heard of the Sacred Eagle and the Sacred Sparrow, but only once, and it was from the God of Light. The esteemed God of Light spoke of them with such reverence. It struck me as strange at the time...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She seemed to be searching for the Sacred Eagle and the Sacred Sparrow herself! She mentioned that they were friends with the esteemed God of Night, and only the God of Night knows where they are! Unfortunately, the esteemed God of Night has been absent for over twenty years now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jethro finished, Mila's eyes lit up with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, the esteemed God of Light is looking for my parents, too? And my parents are friends with the esteemed God of Night? Only he knows where they are?" she exclaimed, her voice trembling with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was equally taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The God of Light is one of the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community! And she's one of the only two still alive, incredibly powerful&mdash;far beyond Grandpa's level. Otherwise, Grandpa wouldn't have treated her with such respect; she's the last hope for the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she speaks about Mila's parents with such reverence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just who are Mila's parents? What kind of power do they possess?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the God of Night, the top warrior in the Human Community, counts them as friends?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Mila, his mind racing with questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro said, "Mila, if you want to find your parents, it seems you'll have to wait for the esteemed God of Night to return," he said, his tone serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know! As long as there's hope of finding them, I'll be satisfied!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she stepped back, a determined look on her face. "Osborne, let's get moving!"</span></p></div>
