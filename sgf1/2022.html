        <h1>Chapter 2015 The Wager</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An entire lineup made up of Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's lips curved upward. "That's perfect! I can take the chance to kill a few more of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't speak loudly, but the area was full of warriors with incredible power, so everyone heard him clearly. Their faces showed shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of Demon Slayer, Osborne, didn't seem nervous at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with a lineup of Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies, he actually thought it was better&mdash;an opportunity to kill more of them? Was his confidence in the Demon Slayer members really that strong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the battle had yet to begin, their curiosity about Demon Slayer only grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Demon Slayer seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, yet its strength was overwhelming. They could easily deploy ten thousand Deity King Level warriors to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such power was enough to rival the top five Dukedom Level powers in the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Demon Slayer's leader appeared to be only at Ascension One Supernal Deity King Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That level was far too low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Demon Slayer would be on par with groups like the HeartUnited Alliance or the Jackson Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, such arrogance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Julian spoke coldly. Though his voice was low, as if murmuring to himself, it was loud enough for everyone nearby to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You clearly have no idea how powerful a lineup of Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies can be! And yet you think your subordinates can kill a few of them? When they're all dead, then you'll understand what regret feels like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to look at him coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing that God of Light was about to reprimand Julian, Osborne stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke to Julian indifferently, "You think my subordinates will lose this battle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sneered. "Isn't it obvious? Kid, you're so young. Have you ever actually faced a Paramount Supreme Clan prodigy? Do you even know how powerful they are? "I hate to crush your confidence, but the truth is, the very best Human Community prodigies only rank average among the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies on that stage might not be much within their clan, but among us humans, they'd be considered the very best!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think your people have any chance of winning under these circumstances? The gap between the Human Community and the Paramount Supreme Clan widens as the level increases&mdash;that's just how resources work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the Transcendent Deity Level, Celestial Deity Level, or even Deity Overlord Level, humans have a chance. But above the Deity King Level? Winning becomes ten times harder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To this day, we haven't won a single battle above the Deity King Level. That's proof enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's expression was full of disdain as he finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you don't even know how strong Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies are, yet you dare spout such nonsense, thinking your subordinates can win? You even believe they'll take out a few of them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this isn't laughable, then what is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone heard this, they'd think our Human Community is full of arrogant fools like you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Julian finished speaking, murmurs spread among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that many agreed with Julian. While his words were harsh, they were undeniably true&mdash;there was indeed a significant power gap between the Human Community and the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top Human Community prodigies could barely rank in the middle among the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Paramount Supreme Clan's top prodigies... were absolutely unmatched at the same level among Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing a lineup of ten thousand Deity King Level Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies, no one thought Osborne's Blood Demon members stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know the true strength of the Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't fought Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm arrogant and conceited?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't get angry, nor did he bother telling Julian that one of the Paramount Supreme Clan's top prodigies, one of the Five Brilliant Scions, had been defeated by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also didn't mention how he had once set up an arena in the East Zone, challenging the younger generation of Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies and leaving them utterly humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, it was all because of his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Julian had known that Osborne was, in fact, the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, he wouldn't have dared to act so smug or mock him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "Since you think my subordinates are bound to lose, why don't we make a bet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian raised an eyebrow and sneered. "A bet? What do you want to bet on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "You're the leader of the HeartUnited Alliance and an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, but I doubt you have anything on you that would interest me. So let's bet on something simple&mdash;a slap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I win, I get to slap you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you win, you can slap me! Or, if you want something else, I can give you anything you desire&mdash;Celestial Crystals, Miracle Elixirs, or even divine artifacts. Whatever you want, as long as you win, I'll give it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words left Julian momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slap?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestial Crystals, Miracle Elixirs, or divine artifacts&mdash;no matter how many he asked for, Osborne would give them to him if he won?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such big talk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian scoffed. "If I win and ask for ten million, or even a billion Celestial Crystals, would you give them to me? If I want ten thousand, or even a hundred thousand Miracle Elixirs, would you deliver? And divine artifacts&mdash;those are rare beyond belief. Do you even have them? If I want ten of them, would you hand them over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "Is that as far as your imagination goes? Fine, the things you just mentioned&mdash;one billion Celestial Crystals, a hundred thousand Miracle Elixirs, and ten divine artifacts&mdash;if you win, I'll give them all to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone here, including God of Light, can bear witness. If I can't deliver, you can have my life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course... if I win, I get to slap you, and you're not allowed to block it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you dare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words left Julian completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Osborne really produce all of that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't believe it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others around them were equally shocked, unable to believe that Osborne could have one billion Celestial Crystals, a hundred thousand Miracle Elixirs, and ten divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Sanctum of Light... probably couldn't come up with those!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So how could Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all thought Osborne was bluffing. His real wager... was his life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sneered. "Since you've gone this far, of course I'll take the bet! Fine, if your subordinates manage to win this battle, I'll let you slap me. So what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you lose...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, heh! And if you can't deliver on your wager, don't blame me for being merciless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished, a glint of murderous intent flashed in Julian's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, completely unbothered. "Fine! Let everyone here be witnesses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne ignored Julian entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his attention to the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the stage, ten thousand Blood Demon members and ten thousand Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies were closing in on each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle had finally begun.</span></p></div>
