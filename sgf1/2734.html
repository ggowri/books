        <h1>Chapter 2603 The First Under Empyrean Sacredness-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ended, but now the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom is talking about one name&mdash;Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The champion of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first under Empyrean Sacredness of the Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is the strongest!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne overpowered the nine princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family, showcasing terrifying strength and winning the championship in an undisputed manner!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, there's also Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are joint champions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But almost everyone knows they won the championship because of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They actually admitted the joint championship?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy looked at each other, stunned by the overwhelming surprise. Not long ago, when Osborne revealed his plan to Clara and Leroy, they were utterly shocked, but they also thought the plan was absolutely impossible to succeed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I thought the Royal Family would make us have a rematch to decide the winner! Or, they would acknowledge our joint championship but only let us split the rewards for 'champion, runner-up, and third place.'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, they didn&rsquo;t make us have a rematch?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And they actually agreed to reward each of us 20 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints? That&rsquo;s 20 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints per person!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, one of them could only be the runner-up, and the other the third place, with a combined reward of only 15 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne, with a small plan, not only got them the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel championship title but also earned each of them 20 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their reward directly doubled!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, how did you know the Royal Family would agree? By all accounts, they should have made us compete again..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara was very curious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "If they made us compete again, even better! I would make the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family lose face once more!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For example, if we still concede to each other and refuse to decide a winner, what would the Royal Family do? Keep making us compete endlessly?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, Clara and Leroy were stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then they could just split the rewards between us! No one would probably say anything about that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's because you don't understand the Royal Family! To the Royal Family, the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints they reward us are just numbers! A little more or less makes no big difference to them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If they act stingy, they'll only be ridiculed. To them, saving face is everything! They've already lost enough face today and won't let it happen again over something like this..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The most important thing is..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced in Frederick's direction and calmly said, "I'm just testing them! Even if they let us split the rewards, we wouldn't lose, right? Plus, you two would gain an extra championship title!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy nodded at those words, completely convinced by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they looked at the Kingdom Duel Badge with 24 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, when can we enter the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury? I can't wait to exchange treasures with the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's already late, and the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony is over! Let's go, we'll head back to the hotel first. Tomorrow, someone will take us to the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne followed the crowd and walked out of the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, everything had gone just as he planned&mdash;except for the one thing he couldn't accomplish: paying tribute to Michelle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom lost all their face!</span></p></div>
