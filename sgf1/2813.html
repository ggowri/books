        <h1>Chapter 2663 Changes-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt completely refreshed. "I really broke through!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that the joy of breaking through his cultivation level surpassed any pleasure in the world, even more satisfying than the intimacy between a man and a woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the higher the cultivation level, the more intense and lasting this pleasure becomes. No wonder those with higher cultivation levels grow indifferent to emotions, caring less about romantic relationships and focusing more on pursuing greater power and higher cultivation levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne really wished he could experience this breakthrough feeling a few times every day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, that's impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though this is the Eighth Skyfall Casket, and even though he can devour part of their power to quickly enhance his strength after killing astral projections on the Ancient Battlefield, breaking through the cultivation level is still not easy for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. However, if he wanted to break through to Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, he might have to kill all the astral projections within 124 thousand miles around him, and even that might not be enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, this would take a lot of time. After all, most of the time, Osborne could only directly kill these astral projections at the Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level by using his strongest attack, Heaven Arrow, and that too when they were severely injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And each time after using Heaven Arrow, Osborne must wait for a thirty-minute cooldown time before he can use it again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he could use tenfold Time Acceleration to speed up the cooldown time, he would still need three minutes to cast it once.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Luckily, I've now reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. My strength has grown. Now, even if I use Earth Arrow, I have a good chance of killing those severely injured, near-death astral projections. My speed in killing astral projections will be much faster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with excitement. He didn't want to miss such a great opportunity to enhance his cultivation level and strength, so he immediately plunged back into the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sacred Power Arrows kept shooting out, killing one astral projection after another. At this moment, all the astral projections in the surrounding area had been completely wiped out by Osborne. Those endlessly cycling astral projections would no longer appear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne continued his relentless slaughter, the cleared areas of the Ancient Battlefield grew larger, and his strength kept increasing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, far away from Osborne, Clara was also slaughtering the astral projections around her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her luck was much better than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she was also transported to the Ancient Battlefield, the astral projections fighting around her were not very strong, only reaching the level of ordinary Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara wanted to leave. But after attempting to kill an astral projection, she immediately discovered that she could absorb part of their power and quickly enhance her strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she also began the slaughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was currently only at primary Empyrean Sacredness. However, she could fight against those at advanced Empyrean Sacredness and even kill them. Through such slaughter, her strength and cultivation level rapidly increased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Osborne was still figuring out how to escape, she had already reached mid Empyrean Sacredness and was quickly striving to achieve advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far from her, Leroy encountered the same situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were lucky and were both teleported to the edge of the Ancient Battlefield. Around them were astral projections they could defeat, so they didn&rsquo;t have to flee like Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But some people weren&rsquo;t as lucky as them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in the deeper center of the Ancient Battlefield, a person stood fearfully in the middle of the safe zone. The surrounding astral projections in battle were so powerful that he couldn&rsquo;t comprehend it. He felt that even the strength of a warrior at Imperial Empyrean Sacredness could never be this terrifying.</span></p></div>
