        <h1>Chapter 2363 Isidore's Conspiracy</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't get too worked up," Isidore said with a smile. "Uriah, you have no choice now. You don't think I'd let you go, do you? If I kill you now, the Elven Mother Tree will have no one to care for it, and it will still wither away gradually, causing problems for Elf City."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, rather than letting the Elven Mother Tree wither away, it's better to let it merge with me. Right now, the Elven Mother Tree is at its weakest state. This is the best opportunity for me to merge with it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as I merge with the Elven Mother Tree, my power will grow, and I will become a top-tier Empyrean Sacredness warrior. By then, I can better protect Elf City and ensure its continued existence."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you must help me merge with the Elven Mother Tree. Otherwise, I'll kill your wife and son."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah's face turned grim. He roared angrily, "Isidore, you're dreaming. You actually want to merge with the Elven Mother Tree? The Elven Mother Tree can only be cared for by the Nature Elf Clan and can only merge with them. Otherwise, it will gradually wither and completely vanish."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As a Light Elf, you actually want to merge with the Elven Mother Tree? You'll destroy it this way. For the sake of your own power, you dare to have such an evil thought. The other Elf Royal Families won't agree to this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Isidore sneered, "The other Elf Royal Families? They can only agree because the entire Elf City is now under my control. The other Elf Royal Families are just my dogs. Whatever I tell them to do, they will do."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you don't need to worry about the other Elf Royal Families. I'll just ask you one thing. Will you help me merge with the Elven Mother Tree or not?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Isidore's eyes were filled with intense killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He reached out and grabbed Sherwood's throat. "If you refuse, I'll kill your son first, then your wife. Don't think you're that important. In fact, even without your help, I can still merge with the Elven Mother Tree; it will just take more time and cost. Now, tell me your answer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore gripped Sherwood's throat, his face full of killing intent, arrogantly staring at Uriah.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah's body trembled violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were filled with anger, but he was completely helpless. Isidore was at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, the strongest warrior in Elf City, while Uriah was only at primary Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah was no match for Isidore. Besides, he was injured now, so resisting was pointless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Sherwood's flushed face, Uriah felt immense pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Father, don't worry about me," Sherwood said with difficulty. "Isidore is the murderer of Alfreda. Now he wants to take over the Elven Mother Tree and destroy it to enhance his power. You must never agree to him. Even if I die, you must never agree to him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Sherwood's gaze was incredibly resolute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're courting death." Isidore was completely enraged, exerting much more force. Instantly, everyone heard the cracking sounds from Sherwood's throat, as if Isidore would crush it in the next second.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop it!" Uriah shouted anxiously, "Isidore, if you dare kill my son, you will never gain the Elven Mother Tree's approval, never merge with the Elven Mother Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Isidore smiled and said, "So, are you agreeing to help me merge with the Elven Mother Tree?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah bit his lower lip, deeply hesitant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uriah, you can't agree to him." Hilaria stared at Isidore, her eyes filled with hatred and killing intent. "He killed our daughter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if we all die, you can't agree to him. The Elven Mother Tree cannot be destroyed by him, nor by your hands. Otherwise, our family will be sinners of the Elf Race."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Hilaria's words, Uriah became even more hesitant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Isidore sneered, "Hilaria, it seems you don't care at all about your son's life or death. In that case, I'll kill him first and see if you're truly that heartless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Isidore exerted force again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop it!" Uriah shouted, "Isidore, let my son go. I can agree to your terms. But in my current condition, I can't help you merge with the Elven Mother Tree. I need to heal first. Only after I recover can I do it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uriah!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Father!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hilaria and Sherwood were instantly shocked, staring at Uriah in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah clenched his teeth and said, "Shut up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he looked at Isidore. "Isidore, I can help you merge with the Elven Mother Tree, but I need a promise from you. That is to release my wife and son. Once you merge with the Elven Mother Tree, your cultivation level will surely break through, making you a top-tier Empyrean Sacredness warrior."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, my wife and son won't pose any threat to you. Even if you release them, they wouldn't dare seek revenge on you. As long as you agree to this condition, I'll help you merge with the Elven Mother Tree. Otherwise, since we'll end up being killed by you anyway, why should I help you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah looked extremely determined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Isidore smiled and said, "Alright. I can promise you. Once your injuries heal, help me merge with the Elven Mother Tree. When you do it, I'll release them. For now, just focus on recovering."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Isidore dropped Sherwood and left with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The prison instantly fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uriah, why did you agree to Isidore? This will destroy the Elven Mother Tree and Elf City. Isidore has gone mad. How could you help him?" Hilaria bit her lower lip, her face covered in tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sherwood also said in confusion, "Father, we can't do this. We are the Nature Elf Clan, the closest to the Elven Mother Tree. We must protect the Elven Mother Tree with our lives and never help Isidore destroy it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing their words, Uriah sighed and said, "What can I do? If I don't agree, you'll be killed immediately. Should I just watch you die in front of me? I've already lost my daughter. I don't want to lose you too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's more, since Isidore dares to harm us, he must have already found a way to forcibly merge with the Elven Mother Tree. It's just that his method will take more time and won't be as effective. Even if I don't help him, the Elven Mother Tree will still be destroyed by him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Uriah's words, Hilaria and Sherwood both fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their hearts were filled with sorrow and despair, completely unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, after confirming Isidore had gone far, Osborne knew it was time to act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used soul power to directly communicate with Isidore. "Your Majesty, I might have a way to save you and protect the Elven Mother Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah's body trembled instantly. "Who is it? Who's speaking to me?"</span></p></div>
