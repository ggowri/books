        <h1>Chapter 2619 Key-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Frederick finished speaking, everyone quickly looked toward the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Celestial Spire was enormous. If it were in the cosmos, it would resemble a massive tower-shaped celestial body. But upon closer inspection, they could see it was indeed man-made, constructed from countless massive stone bricks, with a total of ninety-nine floors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tower was covered in intricate, dizzying patterns, and each stone brick exuded a chilling aura, as if ancient defeated warriors were roaring in fury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just by looking at the Celestial Spire from afar, everyone felt immense fear, their hearts pounding uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only those who haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness can enter the Celestial Spire?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are there keys to unlock the nine Skyfall Caskets in the Celestial Spire? Can the caskets only be opened with the keys? Could it be that the Skyfall Caskets contain countless opportunities, treasures, and power to greatly enhance everyone's strength?" Adriana asked with a frown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, the key is for us to enter the Celestial Spire and obtain the keys to the nine Skyfall Caskets, right? Are you sure only those who haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness can enter the Celestial Spire? What happens if someone who has reached Empyrean Sacredness enters it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana voiced everyone's doubts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone withdrew their gaze and looked at Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick smiled faintly, "Don't worry! Since we're here, I will answer all your questions. First, there are no keys to the nine Skyfall Caskets in the Celestial Spire. To be precise, there are only keys to eight Skyfall Caskets inside."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's because the key to the Ninth Skyfall Casket was taken out tens of thousands of years ago, and the Ninth Skyfall Casket has already been opened."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twelve people in total opened the Ninth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They were later called..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The powerful figures from major forces were shocked and looked at Frederick. Except for Adriana, who had already learned the truth from Osborne, everyone else was stunned."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On Racial Convergence Planet, everyone knows the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With the emergence of twelve top powerhouses, they overthrew the Overpowering Dynasty's rule over Racial Convergence Planet, reshaping its structure. Each of them was so powerful that future generations revered them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick, do you mean they became so powerful because they opened the Ninth Skyfall Casket in Necropolis City? They gained countless opportunities, treasures, and power from the Ninth Skyfall Casket?" someone asked in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick nodded and responded, "That's right! Tens of thousands of years ago, the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet accidentally came here. They passed the ninth level in the Celestial Spire, obtained the key to the Ninth Skyfall Casket, and opened it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't know exactly what they obtained. I only know that when the twelve of them emerged from the Ninth Skyfall Casket, they had already become top powerhouses, and three of them even reached the level of Imperial Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Frederick finished speaking, everyone's breathing grew heavier, thinking, "Could it be that we will become powerhouses at the level of Imperial Empyrean Sacredness after coming out of the Ninth Skyfall Casket?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more than fifty powerhouses from various major forces present had all reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, and they knew better than anyone how difficult it was to break through to become a powerhouse at the level of Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It could even be said that their hopes were incredibly slim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if they exhausted their lifespans, their chances of breaking through to reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness were less than one in ten thousand, or even one in a hundred thousand.</span></p></div>
