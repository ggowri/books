        <h1>Chapter 2664 Encounter with Hendrix-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, it was still difficult for him to directly kill those astral projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, his attack power was far inferior to Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, he could kill them slowly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hendrix had just killed an astral projection. Feeling the surge of power within his body, his face was filled with a look of ecstasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix was extremely excited, thinking, "Almost! I only need to kill at most two more astral projections, or maybe just one more, to break through Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection and reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, my cultivation level will be the same as Quinn and Naomi's. Then, my cultivation level will be second only to Weston's, and I will become the fourth among all princes and princesses to reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix was extremely excited, his face flushed, thinking, "Skyfall Casket truly is a treasure-filled place. At this rate, I might break through my cultivation level to reach Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, or even Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. By then, I won't even fear facing my father."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were filled with ruthlessness. He thought, "Father is too cruel, killing Seraphina. I must avenge her. If I can reach Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I will find a way to kill him first. Otherwise, I will eventually be killed by him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Hendrix prepared to continue slaughtering astral projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued searching for a target. As long as he killed one more astral projection, he would have a great chance to reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. He could hardly wait.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he suddenly became excited because he had found his target.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over 621 miles away, he saw two astral projections fiercely battling. One astral projection severely injured the other and quickly killed it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll choose you. Next time you appear, I'll kill you when you're severely injured. By then, I will reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness." Thinking this, Hendrix cautiously made his way over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle ripples from other fights around were still dangerous for him now, so he had to be cautious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, Hendrix suddenly sensed a dangerous feeling behind him. An intense aura of hatred and killing intent suddenly enveloped him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, Hendrix became serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly turned around, looking toward the source of the killing intent. Then, he froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, his eyes filled with excitement and thrill. "It's you! You bastard actually dared to show up in front of me? My luck is amazing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person behind Hendrix was naturally Osborne, who had just arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hendrix was incredibly excited and said eagerly, "It seems my luck is indeed great. As long as I kill you, I can get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket from you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, when the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance in Necropolis City becomes thin again after a thousand years, I can re-enter Necropolis City, enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket again, and continue to enhance my strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, thinking, "Could the Eighth Skyfall Casket be reopened? Can I use the key to unlock it again after a thousand years?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, that's not important. After all, a thousand years is too long.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at Hendrix and said coldly, "You want to kill me? Perfect, I want to kill you too. Let's settle this here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix was stunned, looking at Osborne with some shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he burst into laughter, as if he'd heard the funniest joke, and said, "You want to kill me and settle things with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix's face was full of mockery and sarcasm. "What kind of grudge between us needs to be settled? But with my strength, if I wanted to kill you, it would be as easy as squashing a bug. You want to kill me? Too bad, even if I stand here and don't resist, you still can't kill me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Hendrix's face was filled with an arrogant expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his eyes, Osborne's strength and cultivation level were on the same level as Seraphina's, but there was a huge gap compared to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix thought, "How could Osborne possibly kill me?"</span></p></div>
