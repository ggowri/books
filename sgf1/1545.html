        <h1>Chapter 1544 Harvest</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock as he witnessed Tobey's body explode before him. Just when he was on the verge of transforming Tobey into a member of the Blood Clan, the young man was gone in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy left behind by Lord Malevolence in the Tobey Soul Current Ocean had seemed powerless to stop Osborne's plans, yet at the last moment, it had obliterated Tobey's body completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tobey was undeniably dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, Osborne hesitated to emerge from the parallel dimension. He feared that Lord Malevolence's energy might still linger, ready to strike again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Activating Satan's Eye, he meticulously scanned the area several times, ensuring there were no lingering threats before finally stepping out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Lord Malevolence, you may have killed him and thwarted my plans to enslave him, but what good does that do you? He's still dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even in death, he can still be useful to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can access his memories!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne wasted no time in attempting to capture the remnants of Tobey's memories, hoping to compress them into a Memory Palace stored deep within his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By tapping into Tobey's memories, he could gain valuable insights about the Paramount Supreme Clan and even secrets about Lord Malevolence himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he began his work, he froze in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't find Tobey's memories!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been utterly annihilated along with his body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence, I underestimated you! You didn't just destroy his body; you obliterated his memories, too. Impressive technique!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration bubbled within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he failed to transform Tobey into a Blood Clan member, but he also lost the chance to access his memories. It felt like a significant loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This confrontation with Lord Malevolence had been a clear defeat for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it hardly counted as a confrontation at all; he had faced nothing more than a fragment of Lord Malevolence's power, which was devoid of any true consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, he had gained nothing and had his plans thwarted by that energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne hadn't walked away completely empty-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the explosion that had destroyed much of Tobey's possessions, several valuable items had survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, the Supreme Malevolence Airship and the Supreme Malevolence Sword!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both items were akin to Ultimate Divine Artifacts, and in some aspects, they were even superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were not only immensely powerful but also incredibly resilient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Lord Malevolence's energy hadn't managed to destroy them, allowing Osborne to claim them for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Supreme Malevolence Airship! The Supreme Malevolence Sword! They're mine now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement surged through him as he reached for the Malevolence Sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness Tobey didn't have the strength to fully unleash the power of this sword, or I might have had a real fight on my hands! What a treasure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung the sword a couple of times, reveling in its sharpness and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I might not be able to wield its full potential just yet, but with it, my maximum attack power will at least double!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too bad I can't use it too often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I get caught, I'll be in deep trouble. I'll have to save it for when I'm really in a bind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne carefully stored the Supreme Malevolence Sword in his Dimensional Space and turned his attention to the Supreme Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne, the airship seemed even more powerful than the sword. He realized that even Tobey, if equipped with enough Essence Crystals, could unleash its might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne didn't possess spatial power to bypass the airship's defenses, he would never have been able to attack Tobey directly inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, he certainly wouldn't have left Tobey unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Osborne would have been taken out by the airship's main and secondary cannons before he even had a chance to react!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, this is a treasure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes gleamed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time Hannah had mentioned the Supreme Malevolence Airship, he had been unable to suppress his desire for one. Unfortunately, given his status, acquiring one had seemed impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Tobey had delivered one right into his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This will be a lifesaver in critical moments! I need to stow it away carefully; it can't fall into the wrong hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a thorough examination, Osborne stored the Supreme Malevolence Airship into his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad Tobey's Dimensional Bag was also destroyed in the explosion. Everything inside it has been lost to the depths of space. Even with my spatial power, I can't retrieve anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of regret flickered across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like the next time I encounter members of the Paramount Supreme </span><span>Clan,</span><span> I'll need to obliterate the energy Lord Malevolence left behind in their Soul Current Ocean first! Otherwise, I can only kill them without the chance to transform them into the Blood Clan or access their memories."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered his strategy for the next encounter with the Paramount Supreme Clan, he continued to scan the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne meticulously erased any traces of the battle while searching for any remnants that might have survived the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a second..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne spotted something glinting in the debris. It was a small vial.</span></p></div>
