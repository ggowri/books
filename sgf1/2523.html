        <h1>Chapter 2424 Ice Beetle</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne patted Flash on the head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash was a bit unhappy because, in his view, his opponent should be someone as powerful as the Magma Devourer, not a tiny bug like the Ice Beetle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no matter how unwilling it was, Flash would still carry out Osborne's orders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It immediately let out a low roar, not the neigh of a warhorse, but the deep growl of a dragon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This low roar not only scared the group of Ice Beetles into halting mid-air but also made Leroy and Clara on horseback tremble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry!" Osborne reassured them, "Flash isn't an ordinary warhorse, so his roar sounds a bit unusual."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara exchanged glances and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They certainly knew Flash wasn't an ordinary warhorse. It had three pairs of wings, while even the legendary Pegasus only had one pair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, those blood-red patterns on Flash were not characteristics of a Pegasus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Flash let out a low growl, the blood-red patterns on his head instantly turned ice blue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Flash suddenly spewed out a burst of ice-blue flames.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is Arctic Dragon's Breath!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All three of Flash's heads can spew Dragon's Breath, and the ice-blue head releases Arctic Dragon's Breath, possessing incredibly powerful ice power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This ice power is so strong that even Osborne dares not easily attempt to resist it. Ordinary Empyrean Sacredness warriors would be easily frozen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, using this ice power against these Ice Beetles feels a bit wasteful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dragon's Breath instantly engulfed the group of Ice Beetles, and in just a moment, they were all frozen mid-air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They hung in the air, unable to flap their wings anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, well done!" Osborne said, smiling as he patted Flash's head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ice Beetles are highly resistant to cold, but Flash's Arctic Dragon's Breath surpassed their limit, killing and freezing them instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waved his hand and collected the tens of thousands of Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These are Ice Beetles worth 20 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not bad! We've finally got a good start today! Next, let's keep searching for Ice Beetles and sweep through this entire glacier area!" Osborne said happily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash dealt with the Ice Beetles effortlessly. Osborne and his team earned points much faster than the past two days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sitting on Flash's back, they earned tens of millions of Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> with ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast to their ease, Brenda and the other contestants were not having such a relaxed time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Cold! So cold!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda, it's freezing here. We have to constantly unleash Sacred Power to withstand the cold! Are you sure we should go deeper?" someone voiced their objection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda calmly said, "Of course! We must keep going deeper! Everyone, bear with it. At least after entering here, there won't be any more annoying Abyssal Snakes, Bloody Ivies, or </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bees! The remaining </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths are just here to deliver Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> to us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for why we need to go deeper, it's because of the Magma Devourer! The Magma Devourer loves heat and dislikes cold. This is the only area beyond its control! Normally, the Magma Devourer wouldn't enter here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The referees have already made too many sacrifices to shield us from the Magma Devourer! We can't burden them any further."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as we reach the depths of the glacier region, the Magma Devourer will definitely stop chasing us! By then, the referees won't have to fight it anymore and can safely wait for reinforcements!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Brenda's words, everyone nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone said, "But it's also dangerous here! I heard the Ice Beetles are terrifying. Their shells are highly defensive, and it's hard for ordinary people to break through! Most importantly, Ice Beetles live in groups. Even the smallest colonies have tens of thousands of them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we get surrounded by Ice Beetles, we're in trouble!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda nodded and said, "I know! But to escape the Magma Devourer, taking some risks is worth it! Next, we need to be more cautious! Ice Beetles spend most of their time dormant and are active only for short periods... Besides, even when they are active, it's usually deep within the glacier."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as we keep quiet, we won't alarm them! And even if they do get alerted, it's fine. I have a way to deal with them..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda confidently said, "Everyone, follow me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She led the team further into the depths of the glacier region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda walked while thinking, "Today is the fifth day of the zone duel! In the first two days, I only found ten Dark Mandalas, worth ten million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>! In the desert area, as the commander, I was allocated the most loot, with a total value likely exceeding fifty million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, if my gains are converted into Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, it's sixty million! Under normal circumstances, no one should have more Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> than me. I'm sure to win the zone </span><span>duel</span><span> championship!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unexpected situations might arise... To be safe, I must earn more Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> to secure the championship!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ice Beetle is my target!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ice Beetle is immune to physical damage, energy damage, and even Flame, but they fear ice elemental power that exceeds their limits!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I happen to have a Sacred Artifact that can unleash powerful ice power, perfect for dealing with Ice Beetles! As long as we find the Ice Beetles, when others can't handle them, I'll use the Sacred Artifact to take them down, and I'll get the largest share of the loot!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That way, my gains will skyrocket!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I must win the championship!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda is very confident. She simply doesn't believe anyone could compete with her for the championship under such circumstances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their group quickly ventured deep into the glacier region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Brenda suddenly noticed faint energy fluctuations deep within the glacier ahead using the Golden Dragon Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought excitedly, "Could it be Ice Beetles? When Ice Beetles are dormant, their aura is completely concealed, but my Golden Dragon Eye can still detect the aura of those sleeping in the shallow layers of the glacier."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There should be a group of Ice Beetles here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking this, Brenda secretly released a strand of Sacred Power in that direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the glacier began to shake, and a swarm of Ice Beetles rapidly charged toward them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda was overjoyed, but she kept a serious expression and shouted, "Everyone, be careful! We've disturbed the Ice Beetles! Defend and counterattack immediately..."</span></p></div>
