        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After completing his task, Osborne finally retracted his Spatial Domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a sense of satisfaction wash over him; it was the first time he had unleashed his Level Six peak Spatial Domain, and it had performed beautifully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the Deathborn in the E53 sector had been dealt with. According to the plan, they should have returned to the Wild Flame Army immediately&mdash;staying out in the field for too long was risky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne wasn't quite ready to head back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the No. 9 mining area, the only site among the twelve surrounding Wild Flame City that produced top-grade Essence Crystals. Although these precious crystals were rare and buried deep within the mines, Osborne had fully regained his strength. With his abilities, he was more than capable of venturing into the depths of the mine to seek out these coveted treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't yet laid eyes on a top-grade Essence Crystal, and since he was here, Osborne wasn't about to let this opportunity slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intended to delve into the mine and bring back some of those crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Osborne was fully healed, he could use the Essence Crystals to further bolster his power and elevate his standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One top-grade Essence Crystal is worth 10 thousand low-grade ones. I've got to take some back. Even if I don't use them for training, they'll serve as currency. After all, in Celestara, Essence Crystals are the real deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With night falling, he decided to let the entire team stay overnight in the No. 9 mining area, planning to return to the Wild Flame Army at dawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the reason, he'd leave that to Jeffrey to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Jeffrey couldn't handle such a simple task, he'd never earn the title of centurion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was one more crucial thing Osborne needed to accomplish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intended to transform all the human overseers in the No. 9 mining area into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would serve two purposes: first, these overseers could act as his eyes and ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second, once they became Blood Clan members, he could command them to stop exploiting and mistreating the human miners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life for the miners in the No. 9 mining area would improve significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silently, Osborne issued orders to Jeffrey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Jeffrey rallied the group. "Let's move out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Alick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team followed Jeffrey as they left the E53 sector.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, it appeared that Jeffrey was still leading the group as a centurion, but only they knew he was merely a puppet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real decision-maker was Osborne, who blended into the crowd, seemingly inconspicuous yet orchestrating everything from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they emerged back above ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Alick, esteemed guests, you're finally back! Have you dealt with the Deathborn in the E53 sector?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chester and the other overseers quickly surrounded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were about three hundred overseers, all wearing eager, ingratiating smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey nodded slightly. "Yes, we've taken care of it. However, the Deathborn we faced were more numerous and powerful than your reports indicated. We lost a few men and are quite exhausted, so we'll be resting here for the night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chester's expression turned serious at this news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Alick, we take full responsibility! It was our faulty intelligence that put you in danger. Please accept this small token of our apology."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed Jeffrey a bag filled with Essence Crystals. "As for your overnight stay, we'll ensure you receive the highest level of hospitality! If you desire, we also have some lovely human miners here. If you don't mind their humble status, I can arrange for them to keep you company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chester's obsequiousness was palpable as he spoke, but Jeffrey didn't reach out to accept the offered bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he would have eagerly accepted Chester's gestures, but this time, he held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold demeanor, he said, "We won't need that anymore. From now on, we're all on the same team, so let's not play these games."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chester was taken aback by the statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Same team? Did Jeffrey actually say he's considering us one of his own?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His astonishment grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When has someone like Jeffrey ever considered us lowly humans as equals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They only smile when we grease their palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chester's voice trembled as he asked, "Mr. Alick, what do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey flashed a grin. "What I mean is, you lot will be like us, becoming the most loyal servants of my Lord. We're all in this together now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Osborne stepped out from the crowd with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeffrey is right. You will become my most loyal servants, just like him. We're all one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Chester and the others could react, Osborne unleashed a formidable spatial force, immobilizing them instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his body, a single drop of blood emerged and split into hundreds, each one entering the bodies of Chester and his group, initiating the transformation into the Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chester and the others, mere Superior Deities, had no resistance.</span></p></div>
