        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he had heard every word but chose to ignore the provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Looking for a fight, are you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If that guy still has the balls to come after me after the Sect Tournament, I might just respect him for his audacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's thoughts drifted back to the conversations around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Vadim from Peak One?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Jamar from Peak Three?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bethan from Peak Two?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those three are the cream of the crop among all the core disciples in Mystic Sirius Sect! They took part in the city duel in Tempest Fortress City ten years ago and made it into the top ten! It's a pity they couldn't make a name for themselves in the state duel in Zephyr State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally cracked open his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He followed the crowd's line of sight and caught a glimpse of those three big-shot figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not too shabby! They're seriously strong, and their presence is off the charts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he shut his eyes again and settled in to wait for the official start of the Sect Tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, whispers started to spread through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Mr. Wilkens!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Mr. Wilkens!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of Mystic Sirius Sect, Lenny, made his grand entrance. He was a middle-aged man. He tossed out a few words of encouragement and then declared the tournament officially open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched as Lenny sauntered closer to Angela and started chatting her up like there was no tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a real contrast. While Lenny was all grins, Angela remained as cold as ice, only responding after a long, drawn-out pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is the sect master of Mystic Sirius Sect trying to sweet-talk Angela?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly shrugged off that thought as the tournament took the spotlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first thing on the agenda was the draw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All 280 participants would be randomly divided into twenty groups of fourteen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, they'd dive into a wild free-for-all. No teaming up allowed&mdash;just straight one-on-one showdowns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last person left standing in each group would seize the top spot, and the twenty group winners would move on to the final rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up were the one-on-one matches, where each contestant would go head-to-head in nineteen battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten with the best overall records would get the golden ticket to represent Mystic Sirius Sect in the upcoming city duel at Tempest Fortress City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rules were simple yet ruthless, and Osborne was all for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The draw wrapped up in a flash, and Osborne peeked at the wooden token in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Number five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd landed in the fifth group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't be bothered to check who else was in his group; it was all the same to him. No matter who his opponents were, he was dead set on being the last one standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his </span><span>couldn't-care-less</span><span> attitude didn't stop others from taking notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other participants from Peak Seven were scoping out the place, nervously trying to figure out who they'd be grouped with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was when the earlier critic, the one who'd called Osborne rude, caught sight of his token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mischievous glint sparked in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! What a coincidence! You're in Group Five too! Looks like your luck has just run out by being in the same group as me! I was </span><span>gonna</span><span> teach you a lesson after the tournament, but now I don't have to wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be the first one to square off against you in the arena! Even if I don't make it out of the group stage, at least I can brag about beating you. That </span><span>ain't</span><span> a total wash, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot Osborne a menacing smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to face him, looking calm on the surface, but a hint of contempt flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd advise you not to pick a fight with me. If you stay out of my way, you might last a bit longer in this tournament. But if you don't, you're </span><span>gonna</span><span> end up kicking yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took a look at the other guy's Kingdom </span><span>Duel</span><span> Token and finally caught his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Areli </span><span>Seyfried</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Areli's face contorted with fury at Osborne's words. "You're way too full of yourself for an inner disciple! You think you can talk to me like that? Well, fine! I was just </span><span>gonna</span><span> give you a taste of my power, but now I'll make sure you're laid up in bed for days after this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with a menacing glint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just let out a chuckle. "We'll just have to wait and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned his back on Areli and headed straight for Arena Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were ten arenas in all, all set to kick off the group battles at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was raring to go; his fight was about to start!</span></p></div>
