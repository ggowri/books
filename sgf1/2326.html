        <h1>Chapter 2271 The Power of a Sacred Artifact-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the arena, fairness was always relative; absolute fairness was but a pipe dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> when Leroy whipped out the legendary Inferno Drake Lance, a Sacred Artifact, no one in the crowd batted an eye. After all, having a top-notch weapon was just part and parcel of a fighter's prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one couldn't get his hands on one, tough luck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't bothered by Leroy's edge, either. In fact, finding out she was wielding such a beast of a weapon only got his blood pumping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, he let loose a volley of ten Sacred Power arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrows zipped through the air like lightning bolts, their speed so blinding it seemed they might just rip a hole in the very fabric of existence as they streaked towards Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Leroy stood her ground, radiating unwavering confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne had already shown just how powerful his Sacred Power arrows were, Leroy didn't flinch. As the arrows closed in, she thrust the Inferno Drake Lance forward. A fearsome fire dragon burst forth from the spear, coiling and contorting until it took the shape of a real, menacing flame-breathing dragon. With a gaping maw, it gobbled up all ten of Osborne's arrows in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous blast reverberated through the air as the arrows hit the fire dragon head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames went flying in all directions, but the arrows simply disappeared into thin air!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, in a flash, Leroy had completely nullified Osborne's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This jaw-dropping scene sent shockwaves through the crowd from Azure Haven Academy. They went wild, cheering and whooping with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you so! I always knew Leroy was a force to be reckoned with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's Sacred Power arrows were pretty cool, but they didn't stand a chance against Leroy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy's victory is in the bag!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's on an absolute tear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Azure Haven Academy folks were in full-on celebration mode, the supporters from Mystic Sirius Sect were left speechless. Their faces were blank with disbelief as they stared at Leroy and her Inferno Drake Lance, unable to look away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> freaking strong! It was mind-bogglingly powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the stuff of legends&mdash;the raw might of a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way Osborne's ten Sacred Power arrows got wiped out in one fell swoop left the Mystic Sirius Sect supporters feeling utterly hopeless. How could they possibly keep fighting against such an unstoppable force? They might as well just call it quits!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite the gloomy mood among his sect's supporters, Osborne wasn't about to be discouraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, the sheer power of the Inferno Drake Lance had caught him off guard, but his fighting spirit was like a blazing inferno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stayed as cool as a cucumber. If one plan didn't work, he'd simply roll up his sleeves and try something else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fired up with determination, he quickly readied his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow for another shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne channeled all his energy into a single Sacred Power arrow, but this one was no ordinary arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It glowed with a brilliance ten times brighter than before, as Osborne poured his Divine Ascendance Technique into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That arrow became the very essence of his Spatial Oblivion Slash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow shot off like a bullet, instantly shattering into a gazillion arrow shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They came raining down on Leroy like a never-ending onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cheering crowd from Azure Haven Academy suddenly went dead silent. Their excitement screeched to a halt, like a car slamming on the brakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? A new move?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Leroy raised an eyebrow, a flash of surprise crossing her face. But she didn't bat an eyelash. With a powerful swing of the Inferno Drake Lance, gushing flames shot out from its tip. They swirled around her like a tornado, quickly tearing apart the incoming arrow shadows. None of them could get anywhere near her. The blazing shield of fire from her Sacred Artifact stopped them all cold.</span></p></div>
