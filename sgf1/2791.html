        <h1>Chapter 2644 Leaving Celestial Spire</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A figure appeared in front of the Celestial Spire. Everyone turned to look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick also looked over excitedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought it was Seraphina coming out with the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when he saw that it was Casey who came out, he was a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's her! She's with Osborne, Clara, and Leroy. She got eliminated. Looks like Osborne, Clara, and Leroy will be out soon too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm curious about which level of the trial they ultimately passed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It should be the fourteenth level, at most the fifteenth!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd started discussing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Frederick was a bit disappointed, he still brought Casey back to their area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, he was already certain that Seraphina had successfully obtained the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, so he no longer cared much about the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He casually asked, "What situation did you face?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey looked at Frederick with a hint of fear and quickly replied, "We&rsquo;ve been trying hard to pass the trials. But after reaching the fourteenth level, the difficulty suddenly skyrocketed. My strength was too weak, and I was the first to fail and get eliminated."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're indeed on the fifteenth level! With their team's strength, passing the fourteenth level and reaching the fifteenth is already quite impressive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But there's no way they can pass the fifteenth level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ridiculous! Back then, Princess Seraphina gave them a chance to join her team, but they refused and insisted on following Osborne! They must regret it now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Seraphina cleared the eighteenth level and obtained the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket! All of us helped Princess Seraphina. The Royal Family will reward us! But they will get nothing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly! Although Osborne is the champion of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, after breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness, Princess Seraphina reached mid Empyrean Sacredness. Her strength has far surpassed Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne overestimated himself, daring to ignore Princess Seraphina's leadership. Once Princess Seraphina comes out, she will definitely punish Osborne! In the Celestial Spire, she couldn't deal with Osborne, but here, she can."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd murmured, all looking at Casey with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all thought Casey was utterly foolish for not joining Seraphina's team and instead following Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They believed Casey must regret it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Casey listened to the crowd's chatter and thought disdainfully, "These people have no idea how powerful Osborne is!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They also have no clue how much I've gained by following Osborne! Seraphina passed the eighteenth level's trial? Not bad indeed..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But unfortunately, Seraphina can't obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket is with Osborne."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey couldn't be bothered to argue with these people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought for a moment and moved a bit closer to Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a figure appeared in front of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was Leroy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy was eliminated too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Clara also appeared. The challenges above the nineteenth floor of the Celestial Spire were too difficult. They rested for a while in the Celestial Spire, taking on the trials one by one, but were ultimately all eliminated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In response to the inquiry, they repeated what they had previously agreed upon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one doubted them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mocking and sarcasm towards them never stopped. Leroy, Clara, and Casey didn't care and quietly waited not far from Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hasn't come out yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With Osborne's speed, he hasn't come out yet. Which level's trial will he pass? Could he pass the twenty-seventh level's trial?" Leroy, Clara, and Casey were secretly discussing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That&rsquo;s probably impossible! The difficulty of the later trials is just too high! Starting from the twenty-first level, opponents at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection appear! From the twenty-fourth level, Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection starts showing up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And on the twenty-seventh level, a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior might even appear!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In such a situation, no matter how strong Osborne is, it's impossible for him to pass the twenty-seventh level's trial."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were discussing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a figure appeared again in front of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne used up all his battle points on the twenty-seventh level, he chose to enter the twenty-eighth level. He wanted to see how difficult the trial on the twenty-eighth level would be.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His opponents were ten Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they were just Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, they were still beyond what Osborne could handle at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were a single opponent, he might give it a try.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was ultimately eliminated and teleported out of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When my cultivation level reaches Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I will return to the Celestial Spire! The Celestial Spire is a treasure trove, and next time, I will clear all the way to the fifty-fourth level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, I can exchange for lots of good stuff..." Osborne thought, then noticed everyone was looking at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the distance, Frederick, Callista, Adriana, and even the eliminated Emiliano and Matthew were all looking at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey were also looking at him excitedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a force enveloped Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was Frederick's power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took the opportunity to feel Frederick's power, his expression serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "What a formidable power!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The projections of those Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors on the twenty-eighth floor are far inferior compared to Frederick! He truly deserves to be one of the three Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors on the Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew that he was still far from being a match for Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suppressed his hatred and killing intent as he was brought before everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick casually asked, "Which level of the trial did you pass?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmly replied, "I passed the fifteenth level and was eliminated at the sixteenth!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick nodded and said, "Not bad! Go back and rest!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick still looked expectantly in the direction of Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was already losing patience.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne slowly walked to Clarissa's side and nodded toward Adriana in the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Adriana's voice echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She asked, "Osborne, which level of the trial did you actually pass? Was it really only the fifteenth level?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought for a moment and replied, "Adriana, if I said I passed the eighteenth level of the trial, would you believe me? Don't be surprised, don't let anyone notice! Actually, I've already obtained the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket... but I'm not planning to take it out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Frederick has been preparing for a long time to enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket! If the Eighth Skyfall Casket is opened, Frederick is most likely to gain the greatest benefit!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He might even break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness because of this! So, I'm not planning to take out the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Osborne in disbelief and asked, "What did you say? You passed the eighteenth level of the trial before Seraphina? The key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket is in your hands?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana couldn't believe it.</span></p></div>
