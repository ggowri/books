        <h1>Chapter 1166 Start Transplanting</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious as he swore an oath, though he deliberately avoided using his real name, opting instead for "Owen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, he wasn't sure if this ruse would fool Cain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Cain reduced to a mere fragment of his former self, Osborne figured the ancient vampire wouldn't have much leverage against him. After all, as Cain had pointed out, he was the only one in millennia to reach this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Cain's eyes, Osborne was his last hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Cain had ulterior motives, he wouldn't dare eliminate Osborne just yet. At least not until he had helped Osborne escape this realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain chuckled. "No need to swear. I'm not one for oaths; I trust only in mutual benefit! As I said, we're natural allies, and our interests are aligned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, once you've integrated the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity into your </span><span>body, if you decide to back out on me, I have my ways to ensure you'll never achieve a perfect union with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of anger rise within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What a bastard! When the time comes, I'll find a way to take him down! But for now, I need to play along until I get my hands on the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Putting on a calm facade, he smiled, "Don't worry, Cain. I am not the kind of guy who forgets a favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you help me secure the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and boost my power, I promise I'll find a way to repay you by avenging you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain merely scoffed, his expression unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, "Now, can we proceed with the transplant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do I need to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain replied, "Absolutely! You possess the Blood Cross, and since you've fused it with your body, you're already a natural vessel for the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! You're the only one in the world who stands a chance of integrating it into your being."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Cain's voice grew colder, laced with bitterness and hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Years ago, the God of Night tried to kill me over a trivial matter, and I knew he was after my Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! That's why I hid the Blood Cross away. As long as he couldn't get his hands on it, even as a Deity King, he wouldn't be able to claim the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity or merge with it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet here we are, years later, and the Blood Cross has resurfaced, falling into your hands just as you found the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Talk about luck! Perhaps it's the Goddess of Fate smiling upon us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Follow my instructions, and with my assistance, you'll easily transplant the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity into your body! But merging it fully to become the true progenitor of the Blood Clan, achieving immortality&mdash;that's another story...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your body is too weak! You haven't forged a Divine Body yet, which means you can't merge with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And even a regular Divine Body won't cut it! The stronger your Divine Body, the greater the benefits you'll receive from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. The more powerful the integration, the better the results!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I was merely a Deity Overlord, I possessed a Level Seven Solar Divine Body, rivaling many Deity Kings. That's how I achieved true immortality!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In due time, I'll guide you on how to forge a more powerful Divine Body! I'll even help you achieve a Level Seven Solar Divine Body, just like I did!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving Osborne a brief overview, Cain explained how to transplant the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, Osborne already knew the procedure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he laid eyes on the Lotus, a wealth of information surged into his mind as if it had been engraved there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea why, but as Osborne compared his instinctual understanding with Cain's instructions, he realized there were no discrepancies, which finally put him at </span><span>ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'm ready to begin!" Osborne declared, determination shining in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he focused his energy, tapping into the power of the Blood Cross. A warm surge coursed through him, radiating from every pore until it enveloped the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity floating before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost immediately, the Lotus began to tremble gently, as if trying to pull its roots free from the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cave around them shook violently in response to this subtle movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this for real?" Osborne thought, astonished. He could feel the very ground beneath the Lostridge Mountains rumbling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the seismic energy was building, sending ripples through the earth for miles, triggering a high-magnitude earthquake that spanned hundreds of miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback but had no time for further contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He diligently maintained his focus, nervous about the potential for any reckless gesture to escalate the Lotus' shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If things went sideways, the resulting earthquake would be exponentially more devastating than what he felt at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cities like Eidolon and Newport would surely suffer catastrophic destruction, leaving countless innocent lives in jeopardy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa, nice control you've got there!" Cain's voice cut through Osborne's thoughts, laced with a mix of surprise and approval.</span></p></div>
