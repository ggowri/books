        <h1>Chapter 1265 Hand Over the Secret</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible!" Joseph exclaimed, his eyes filled with shock and jealousy as he stared at Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just been boasting about his Level Three Divine Body, only to discover that this mere Junior Deity, Sebastian, boasted a Divine Body two levels higher, at Level Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having a Level Five Divine Body at the Junior Deity stage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was exceedingly rare, even in the Age of Gods. Even the most prodigious talents found it difficult to forge a Level Five Divine Body upon ascending to godhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Achieving a Level Four Divine Body was already remarkable enough to warrant the full investment of any major power to be groomed as the next leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan, even as a significant divine clan in the Age of Gods, had never produced such a prodigy at the inception of godhood, with the best they could muster being a Level Four Divine Body, and that only once in a few centuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's eyes burned with envy and anger as he glared at Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was outraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he ascended to godhood, Joseph had at least forged a Level Two Divine Body. It wasn't until his breakthrough to Superior Deity that his Divine Body evolved to Level Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was something he had been quite content with until he laid eyes on Sebastian!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, with his Level Five Divine Body at the start of his divine path, had the potential to reach even higher realms&mdash;perhaps even a Level Seven Solar Divine Body or a Level Eight Galactic Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Eight was a level even a Deity King might not attain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Envy surged through Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Sebastian before turning his attention to the nine others behind Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in disbelief once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight of these nine individuals glowed with a yellow Divine Flame&mdash;a Level Three Divine Body each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining one's Divine Flame shone green, indicating a Level Four Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be!" Joseph was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were just Sebastian with an elevated Divine Body, he might have accepted it, attributing it to Sebastian's singular genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for all ten of them to display such remarkable Divine Bodies&mdash;even a Level Four among them&mdash;was beyond comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph thought incredulously, "Impossible! How can there be so many prodigies?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most ascend to godhood with only a Level One Divine Body; a Level Two is considered talented, and a Level Three is a rare genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here, all ten of them are geniuses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph roared, "This </span><span>ain't</span><span> right! This is way off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is going on with your Divine Bodies? Damn it, how can a so-called 'superpower' like the Augustine family, whom we consider nothing but ants, have so many members with Level Three or above Divine Bodies?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just not possible! Spit it out; what's the deal here? How in the world did you manage to elevate so many of your puny Divine Bodies to Level Three and beyond?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Confess! Hand over that secret, and I might spare your lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the fact that all ten of them possessed at least Level Three Divine Bodies, granting them significantly stronger abilities compared to ordinary Junior Deities, Joseph, who had risen to the peak of Superior Deity, still viewed them with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a terrifying display of his might, Joseph enveloped Sebastian and his nine companions in an intimidating aura; his face contorted with ferocity as he demanded answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian frowned, sensing the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their Divine Bodies were too conspicuous, and Joseph, with his experience, had immediately seen through the anomaly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It only took a moment's thought to realize that such a phenomenon indicated a hidden secret within the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Sebastian was helpless. In the Augustine family, even the least among them, who had transcended to godhood, possessed at least a Level Three Divine Body. There was simply no way to feign inferiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only shrug nonchalantly. "What secret? You mean the secret to our high-level talent? Even we don't know. We were just born this way, you know, naturally talented."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph sneered at this. "Talent? Born this way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you take me for a fool? How many prodigies like you can there be in this world? It's clear that the Augustine family holds a significant secret. But don't worry, that secret will soon belong to the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you won't spill, then I'll just have to subdue you first and then interrogate you at my leisure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Joseph suddenly struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yield! A mere Junior Deity dares to stand before me? You're overestimating yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelming surge of divine power erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's face paled as he witnessed Joseph's attack. The gulf between a Superior </span><span>Deity and a Junior Deity was far greater than he had ever imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's divine power was simply too formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Join forces!" Sebastian shouted, knowing there was no hiding their strength now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rallied the nine others behind him to combine their efforts and block Joseph's devastating, earth-shaking assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous collision ensued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Sebastian and the others were sent flying, their faces paling and blood gushing from their mouths as if they had been rammed by a freight truck.</span></p></div>
