        <h1>Chapter 2403 Heading to the Nest</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was utterly astonished, thinking, "Will the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow one day develop an Artifact Soul, gain intelligence, and become a Singular Lifeform?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could even a massive metal mountain suddenly gain consciousness and intelligence from absorbing too much spiritual energy, becoming a Singular Lifeform?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "The cosmos is vast beyond measure, and any wondrous lifeform could exist. If you were just an ordinary person, could you imagine a flower, a tree, or even an insect possessing intelligence and consciousness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Singular Lifeforms may not be numerous, but they are definitely not rare. It's just that you know too little right now. Once you can one day leave the Racial Convergence Planet, step out of the cosmos, and venture into the deeper parts of the universe, you'll naturally understand."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial looked toward Magma Devourer's direction and continued, "The battle between Magma Devourer and those adjudicators won't end anytime soon. Let's hurry over there. The person killed by Magma Devourer and that adjudicator have plenty of good stuff on them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Their Sacred Artifacts may be shattered, but you can feed them to the Warfare Ancient Tree to accelerate its growth. Also, that adjudicator was at advanced Empyrean Sacredness. His remains can be fed to the Warfare Ancient Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, looking at the completely crushed remains of Valentino and that adjudicator, Osborne really felt reluctant to act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, for the rapid growth of the Warfare Ancient Tree, Osborne eventually took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fragments of Valentino's Sacred Artifact, along with the adjudicator's remains and Sacred Artifact fragments, were all collected by Osborne to serve as nourishment for the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should we do next? Are we just going to watch like this?" Osborne felt a bit bored.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "No. Just leave a clone here to watch them. Their battle won't end anytime soon. Even Gerald can't kill this Magma Devourer, at most, he can injure it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once the Magma Devourer is injured, we'll come back and look for a chance to kill it. As for now, I think you can make a trip to the Magma Devourer's lair."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Magma Devourer probably arrived on Abyssal Planet tens of thousands of years ago. Back then, the Abyssal Clan on Abyssal Planet should have been very powerful. But in the end, they were likely all wiped out or devoured by the Magma Devourer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, in the Magma Devourer's lair, there might be a lot of Abyssal Bone. These Abyssal Bone can be fed to the Warfare Ancient Tree or exchanged for Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, the Magma Devourer is definitely the ruler of Abyssal Planet. Perhaps there are even more treasures in its lair."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> words, Osborne instantly became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While the Magma Devourer is fiercely battling the judges, he can quietly sneak into its lair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!" Osborne no longer hesitated and quickly rushed toward the center of the volcanic area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew where the Magma Devourer appeared, so he quickly determined the direction. Along the way, he even found two Beast Soul Flowers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he did not pick them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already collected over three thousand Beast Soul Flowers, which was enough. The most important thing now was to search for the Magma Devourer's lair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So soon, Osborne returned to the center of the volcanic area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "I remember the Magma Devourer appeared from that direction."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Following his memory, Osborne searched for the Magma Devourer's lair. The Magma Devourer loved magma, so its lair must be deep in the volcano, where the magma was most abundant and scorching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Satan's Eye, Osborne quickly found it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "This volcano looks unremarkable, but the magma pool below is enormous. The underground magma flows up like a river, and its temperature is higher than that of other volcanic magma pools. If I'm not mistaken, the Magma Devourer used to live here. Its lair is deep within this volcanic magma."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said, "You&rsquo;re probably right. I can sense its presence here. Don&rsquo;t waste time, go in and check quickly. We&rsquo;re not the only smart ones. If someone beats us to it, we&rsquo;ll suffer a huge loss."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "Don't worry. While we're not the only smart ones, we're definitely the fastest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne entered the volcano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Activating Sacred Power around him, Osborne dived into the scorching magma, moving as agilely as a fish. Even within the magma, Osborne could clearly see distant situations using Satan's Eye. He kept diving and soon made a discovery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "There's a skeleton over there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This skeleton has Sacred Power fluctuations and special patterns; it's the Abyssal Bone listed on the inventory. A primary Empyrean Sacredness-level Abyssal Bone can be exchanged for 30,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. A mid Empyrean Sacredness-level Abyssal Bone can be exchanged for 300,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. And an </span><span>advanced Empyrean Sacredness-level Abyssal Bone can be exchanged for 3,000,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"An Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection-level Abyssal Bone can be exchanged for 30 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. An Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection-level Abyssal Bone can be exchanged for 300 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the Abyssal Bone and based on the Sacred Power fluctuations, Osborne determined it should be the skeleton of a </span><span>mid Empyrean</span><span> Sacredness-level warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It can be exchanged for 300,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. Of course, Osborne could also feed it to the Warfare Ancient Tree to help it grow faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne decided to put it away for now and decide later whether to exchange it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used ocular energy to transfer the Empyrean Sacredness-level Abyssal Bone into the inner space of Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Osborne continued to dive deeper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The deeper he went, the higher the surrounding magma temperature became. Fortunately, Osborne's fire power elemental essence had already reached the Sacredness Level, merging into the Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, having once ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame, he possessed strong resistance to fire and high temperatures, allowing him to endure for now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Osborne found another Abyssal Bone, still at the mid Empyrean Sacredness level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Osborne discovered more and more Empyrean Sacredness-level Abyssal Bones.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "These Empyrean Sacredness-level Abyssal Bones have been dead for tens of thousands of years, but less than a hundred thousand. It seems the Abyssal Clan warriors tried to join forces to kill the Magma Devourer, only to be counter-killed by it in the end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne collected another Empyrean Sacredness-level Abyssal Bone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this Abyssal Bone was at the advanced Empyrean Sacredness level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Could the Abyssal Clan have been wiped out by the Magma Devourer?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Abyssal Planet is just a small life-bearing planet, and no matter how resource-rich it is, it couldn't possibly produce too many warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, he had already collected over a hundred Empyrean Sacredness-level Abyssal Bones, with the weakest at mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A small resource planet can actually nurture so many warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level. This is far superior to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet. Perhaps, there might be something even more surprising in the Magma Devourer's lair." With that thought, Osborne sped up again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surrounding magma temperature had reached an incredibly terrifying level. Osborne felt that the Magma Devourer's lair should not be far from here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne saw something with Satan's Eye and couldn't help but get excited.</span></p></div>
