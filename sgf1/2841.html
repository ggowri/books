        <h1>Chapter 2686 Drum</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although May's power was suppressed by Osborne with the Dragon Binding Rope, she still looked at Osborne with disdain. "Osborne, you understand nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although our Soulbane Parasite Clan has no power of its own and can't even handle creatures at the Mortal Level, we won't die. Apart from the Ember Phoenix Clan's Undying Flame, we fear nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Compared to that little treant from the Plant Clan, your knowledge is far inferior. You actually claim we have a nemesis? That's ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing May's words, Primordial puffed up his chest. "Osborne, although her words are harsh, she does have a point. I am indeed more knowledgeable than you.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want to scare her with this method, it's pointless. If there were other ways to deal with the Soulbane Parasite Clan, they would have been discovered long ago."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne rolled his eyes helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana felt a bit disappointed. She couldn't believe Osborne's words either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, do you think I'm trying to scare her? No. I'm not scaring her; I truly know of someone who can definitely deal with her." Osborne revealed a confident smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally finding a chance to mock Primordial, Osborne smiled and said, "Primordial, is your brain not working well? I've made it so obvious, yet you still haven't figured it out. Though you're well-informed, it doesn't seem very useful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial was instantly furious. "Osborne, don't go too far! Although the Plant Clan's intelligence isn't as high as the Spirit Clan's or you humans', I'm very sure the nemesis of the Soulbane Parasite Clan is the Undying Flame of the Ember Phoenix Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You absolutely can't find a second way to counter the Soulbane Parasite Clan!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, May also sneered at Osborne, no longer panicking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew Osborne and Adriana had no way to get her out of May's Soul Current Ocean, so she coldly watched Osborne and Primordial argue, as if watching a show.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to explain further, he just smiled and said, "Then watch and see if she can really counter the Soulbane Parasite Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne closed his eyes. "Drum! Drum, come out for a moment."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly contacted Drum, asking him to come out of the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Drum appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stood on Osborne's other shoulder. Apart from Osborne and Primordial, Adriana and May couldn&rsquo;t see Drum at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Daddy, were you calling me? I was just sleeping in Mommy's arms.&rdquo; Drum yawned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum's mother is Empress Kira.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Empress Kira's consciousness was the only thing alive, attached to the Drum of Empress Kira, which was hidden within Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum's Dimensional Microcosm was actually carved out from the Drum of Empress Kira.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Drum was still in her infancy, she spent most of her time sleeping. In the Dimensional Microcosm, she felt as if she were sleeping in Empress Kira's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne smiled at Drum and gently patted her little head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The creature he mentioned that could counter the Soulbane Parasite Clan was Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Drum, can you do me a favor? There's a parasite in her Soul Current Ocean. It's so vile, suppressing her consciousness, devouring her memories, and taking control of her body."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, I can't remove it from her body. But if it stays, it'll kill her. Can you help me get it out?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne waited for Drum's response.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't sure if Drum could handle the Soulbane Parasite. However, Empress Kira was the queen of the Bug Clan. In his view, if Empress Kira could control the Soulbane Parasite Clan back then and make them fight for her, then as Empress Kira's daughter, Drum should be able to do the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But whether that's truly the case, he had to try to find out, and it depended on Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Drum is still in her infancy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in May and Adriana's eyes, Osborne was talking to himself, saying some baffling words to his left shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum?" Adriana frowned and asked, "Osborne, what's wrong with you? Are you hallucinating? Who are you talking to?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May sneered, "Osborne has gone mad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, only Primordial widened his eyes in surprise and said, "Osborne, the creature you mentioned that can deal with the Soulbane Parasite Clan is Drum? Damn! How did I not think of her? Drum can definitely handle the Soulbane Parasite."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's words left Adriana very surprised. "Who exactly is Drum? What are you all talking about? And are your minds really okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Adriana, don't worry. Our minds are perfectly fine, and we're not hallucinating. The reason you can't see Drum is that she's naturally invisible. As long as Drum doesn't want to be seen, no one can see her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne gently touched Drum, who was standing on his left shoulder, and softly said, "Drum, she's a very good friend of mine. Would you let her see you, please?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, in Adriana's gaze, a peculiar bug suddenly appeared on Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This bug had six eyes, eight legs, dozens of wings, sharp mandibles, and a pointed horn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello, I'm Daddy's daughter. My name is Drum." Drum waved her claw at Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's eyes widened in complete shock. She stared at Osborne in disbelief. "Is she your daughter? Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a wry smile, knowing what Adriana was thinking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly explained Drum's situation. Adriana was already his woman, so there was no need to hide many things from her anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he didn't tell Adriana about Empress Kira still being alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, if this matter got out, they would really face big trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only told her that Drum's mother was a powerful figure in the Bug Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, Adriana was already deeply shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Adriana excitedly said, "Are you saying Drum can deal with the Soulbane Parasite?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Drum belongs to the Bug Clan. Her mother holds a high position in the Bug Clan and can suppress or even control most of the Bug Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne looked at Drum. "Drum, can you handle her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Drum finally looked at May.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May's face was full of mockery. Osborne hadn't avoided her when explaining Drum's background to Adriana. Hearing Osborne say that Drum's mother held a high position in the Bug Clan, she felt a bit disdainful and scornful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "So what if Drum's mother holds a high position? She can't deal with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew there was a Bug Clan creature on Osborne's left shoulder that she couldn't see. However, in the Bug Clan, there were many groups with stealth abilities, but not a single one could restrain her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, May remained very calm, not worried at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She even said, "Osborne, don't waste your energy. Are you trying to use the Bug Clan against me? That's ridiculous! Even in the Bug Clan, I have no nemesis."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she even provocatively glanced at Osborne's left shoulder, knowing Drum was there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, May continued, "No matter which group of the Bug Clan you come from, you'd better not mess with me. Otherwise..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before finishing her sentence, May suddenly froze because she saw Drum on Osborne's shoulder. After seeing Drum's appearance, she was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Drum's face was full of excitement. "This is actually a Soulbane Parasite! The Soulbane Parasite Clan hasn't perished yet? Fantastic! I've got a new toy now."</span></p></div>
