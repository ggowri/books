        <h1>Chapter 503 Clarissa's Breakthrough to Class A</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his Draco Star Wristlet, preparing to submit his mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fifth trial had been the most time-consuming so far, taking him a month and a half to complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that time, he had accomplished the impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, as he reviewed the three parts of the fifth trial, it still seemed unbelievable to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Part One: Go to the Augustine Estate in </span><span>Pinchide</span><span> City, become the heir to the Augustine family, identify the traitor within the family, and eliminate the internal threat. Part Two: Restore the Augustine family to its former glory, making it one of the top three ancient families in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. Part Three: Identify all the ancient families in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> that are colluding with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, and eliminate all their elders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month and a half ago, Osborne hadn't imagined he could complete the trial so quickly. His only focus then had been to defeat Alexander and win back Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had done it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and clicked to submit the trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draco Star Wristlet emitted a soft chime, and the mission entered the final evaluation phase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mission evaluation in progress. Awaiting final confirmation. Rewards will be issued upon confirmation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exhaled deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now all he could do was wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps even Godfather hadn't expected him to complete the fifth trial so quickly. Someone would need to verify that he had indeed finished it before the rewards could be issued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, his sixth heir's trial should begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was eager to receive the reward for the fifth trial, but even more eager to finally meet Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather had told him that once he completed the fifth trial, he would earn the right to meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when that moment came, Godfather would finally see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was looking forward to that meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this was his grandfather&mdash;the King of the underground world of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, the true Supreme Overlord, a Class S warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But more importantly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne needed to learn more about his parents from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had really happened to his parents?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were they still alive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would find out soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes grew cold. Ever since he could remember, he had believed he was an orphan, abandoned by his parents. He had even hated them at one point&mdash;if they didn't want him, why had they given birth to him at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until he reunited with Godfather that he learned he hadn't been abandoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His parents had simply encountered an accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that moment, Osborne had been determined to find them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Godfather had refused to tell him more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather believed Osborne was too weak at the time, unqualified to investigate his parents' disappearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne had completed the fifth trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had proven his intelligence and his strength. Now, he was worthy of pursuing the truth behind his parents' disappearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether he could actually find them, Osborne didn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he would give it his all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, let them still be alive," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what are you thinking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's voice suddenly broke his reverie. Osborne turned to see her walking over, holding Autumn's hand, smiling as they approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing," Osborne said as he shut off the Draco Star Wristlet and looked at Autumn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Autumn, he realized just how lucky he was. At least there was still a chance his parents were alive, whereas Autumn had witnessed her parents' deaths firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made Osborne's heart ache for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crouched down, opening his arms with a smile. "Autumn, come here. Daddy wants a hug."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn hesitated, her face showing a bit of apprehension. She glanced up at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa smiled warmly. "Go ahead, Autumn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Autumn ran into Osborne's arms, whispering, "Daddy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sweetheart," Osborne said gently as he lifted her into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was eight years old but so small and light that she felt weightless. She clung tightly to Osborne's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa stepped up beside Osborne, following his gaze as he looked into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Were you thinking about your family just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa smiled slightly. "I could see it in your expression! They say different types of </span><span>longing are readable&mdash;whether you're missing a lover, a parent, or a child, your face shows it differently. </span><span>So</span><span> I think you were probably thinking about your parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised by her insight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded but didn't say anything further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa wasn't going to let the topic drop, though. She pressed on, "You grew up in an orphanage. Have you ever thought about looking for your parents? With your abilities now, you should be able to find them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he really find them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Godfather couldn't locate them. What chance did he have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his silence, Clarissa assumed Osborne hadn't forgiven his parents for abandoning him and didn't want to search for them. She grew anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about I go with you to find them?" she suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd love for your parents to be at our wedding, to bless us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snapped out of his thoughts and smiled. "Clarissa, I know what you're thinking. I'll look for them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa finally seemed relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then said, "Osborne, I think I'm about to break through to Class A! I might need about two weeks, and during that time, I'll need you to take care of Autumn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed at the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're about to reach Class A? That's fantastic!"</span></p></div>
