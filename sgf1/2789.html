        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And even if he could do it, it would probably be a long time from now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sighed, thinking he wouldn't be using Primordial Energy anytime soon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would only have a chance to exchange for Primordial Energy on his third entry into the Celestial Spire!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, he would at least be at the highest level of Imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Forget it. I won't consider Primordial Energy. Let me think about what else I can exchange for!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne still had over 1.4 trillion battle points at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "How about exchanging for another top-grade Imperial Artifact? But I&rsquo;m afraid I can only use a top-grade Imperial Artifact after becoming an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Imperial Artifacts are easy to obtain. I should exchange for something rare, like...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Battle skills?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. Although powerful battle skills are good, he felt that creating them himself would suit him better. His Solar Sacred Arrow and Warfare Blade Technique were self-created, allowing him to unleash his full potential.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!" Osborne suddenly thought of something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Toby, can I exchange for the construction method of a level five Cosmic Translocator here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the Racial Convergence Planet, there is at most the construction method for a level four Cosmic Translocator, which can only enable inter-galactic teleportation. However, a level five Cosmic Translocator allows teleportation between star clusters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "The construction method for a level five Cosmic Translocator?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One hundred billion battle points can exchange for the full set!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said in surprise, "So expensive? One hundred billion battle points could buy twenty low-grade Imperial Artifacts!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne thought for a moment, then nodded and agreed, "Alright! Help me exchange it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you also have the construction method for a level six Cosmic Translocator?" Osborne asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "Of course! Ten trillion battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Forget it, I was just asking! Anyway, I'll come back next time if I get the chance, then I'll exchange it! After all, with my current strength, even if I learn how to build a level six Cosmic Translocator, I don't have the ability to actually construct it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My spatial power is still far too weak!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued thinking about what to exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly he asked, "Toby, can I exchange for life-extending medicine here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course!" Toby replied quickly, "A box of Supreme medicine that can extend life by ten thousand years costs one million battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to exchange life-extending medicine for his family. Their talents were average, especially his grandfather and Divine Shadow and others. Without a stroke of luck, they might find it hard to break through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their lifespans are limited!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had already reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness, with a very long lifespan. He didn&rsquo;t want to see his loved ones pass away before him one day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he believed it was very necessary to prepare some life-extending medicine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then exchange fifty boxes of medicine for me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne believed that fifty boxes of medicine should be enough. Extending his loved ones' lifespans was just a last resort; the most important thing was to enhance their potential and talent, allowing them to reach a higher cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Get me another fifty boxes of talent and potential-enhancing medicine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "That's also 10 billion battle points per box!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>10 trillion battle points spent just like that!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne still had 430 billion battle points left. At this point, he really didn't know what to exchange for, so he simply redeemed 10,000 drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One drop of Legendary Dragon Elixir only costs 10 million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All these add up to just 100 billion battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still had 330 billion battle points left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "I'll exchange for some Supreme medicine to heal injuries!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne exchanged all the remaining 330 billion battle points for medicine to heal injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This medicine costs 10 billion per box. That&rsquo;s only 33 boxes in total.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, all the battle points Osborne earned had been exchanged for what he needed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could say he gained a lot!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Probably the countless beings across the entire Racial Convergence Planet combined aren't as wealthy as him alone!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he alone possesses dozens of Imperial Artifacts...</span></p></div>
