        <h1>Chapter 2367 Discovered</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne noticed that Uriah was also very anxious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Speed up! We're about to succeed. Once we merge with the Elven Mother Tree, Isidore won't be able to defeat us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the three of them sped up their chanting. Their power erupted even more intensely, seemingly merging with the emerald green light emitted by the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, their merging process was not fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The situation is very bad now," Osborne said, his expression turning serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this merging speed, Isidore will definitely be able to stop them. If they fail to merge with the Elven Mother Tree, they will undoubtedly be killed by Isidore, and Osborne will be trapped in Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth, thinking, "I must stop Isidore and prevent him from interrupting their merging."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood are all in the process of merging. They can't take action at all; the only one who can </span><span>is</span><span> Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Isidore is a warrior at the advanced Empyrean Sacredness level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, he has at least a dozen warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level by his side. They are all approaching quickly, filled with killing intent. Osborne is just an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King. How could he possibly withstand them?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "It seems I can only use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore and the others moved incredibly fast and were already nearby. Their eyes were filled with killing intent. They quickly unleashed their power, attacking Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood frantically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You all must die. The Elven Mother Tree is not something you can covet. Die now," Isidore roared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a warrior at the advanced Empyrean Sacredness level, Isidore's power was overwhelming. Even a casual attack from him made Osborne feel as if doomsday had arrived. With Osborne's strength, even with the Warfare Shield, he couldn't withstand such an attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, his cultivation level was too low. He couldn't fully unleash the power of the Warfare Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying attacks came crashing like waves. Osborne clearly saw the panic and unwillingness in Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If struck by Isidore's attack, the three of them would absolutely fail to merge with the Elven Mother Tree and might even suffer severe injuries or death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Damn it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah and the other two chanted the spell as fast as they could. Unfortunately, their fusion with the Elven Mother Tree was still too slow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time had run out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew he couldn't hesitate any longer and absolutely couldn't let Isidore disrupt Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood's fusion with the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, they could only rely on him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth and instantly removed the Ascending Sacred Sanctum from the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, the tattered Ascending Sacred Sanctum shielded Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood overhead, while Osborne appeared inside the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly threw more Sacred Crystals into the energy core.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Defense!" Osborne shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, all intact defense runes of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum lit up. A transparent shield enveloped the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore's fierce attack slammed into the transparent shield of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, producing a terrifying sound.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression changed. He felt the Ascending Sacred Sanctum shaking and trembling violently. The transparent shield was slowly shattering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It couldn't withstand Isidore's fierce attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in the energy core of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, a large number of Sacred Crystals were being frantically decomposed and burned. However, they still couldn't keep up with the consumption. The transparent shield was about to give out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must hold on," Osborne gritted his teeth, feeling extremely tense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Ascending Sacred Sanctum were intact, it could easily withstand Isidore's attack. Isidore was merely a warrior at the advanced Empyrean Sacredness level. Even a top-tier warrior at the Empyrean Sacredness level couldn't break through the defense of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum is a supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, 90% of the defense runes of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum were destroyed, leaving only 10% intact. Moreover, it could only be powered by Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its defense was greatly weakened. Facing Isidore's attack, it could barely hold on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, it held on in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before Osborne could breathe a sigh of relief, Isidore's second, more ferocious attack arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's you!" Isidore said angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had almost obtained the Ascending Sacred Sanctum before. So, how could he not recognize Osborne? Seeing his attack actually blocked by the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, Isidore became extremely furious, filled with a murderous intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He roared, "Osborne, you deserve to die! How dare you show up in Elf City again? How dare you plot against the Elven Mother Tree with Uriah? You're courting death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you're here, don't even think about leaving. Not only is the Elven Mother Tree mine, but the Ascending Sacred Sanctum is also mine. Break it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, a terrifying attack struck the Ascending Sacred Sanctum once again. Its barely recovered shield faced an extremely tough challenge and began to shatter. Part of Isidore's power penetrated the shield and surged inside, instantly blasting Osborne away. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face looked terrible. He thought, "Isidore's attack is terrifying. Even a trace of the power that penetrated the shield can injure me. If I'm hit directly, I might be killed instantly, perhaps even unable to revive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's defense was better than Osborne had expected. Though it seemed to be gradually shattering, it never completely collapsed and managed to withstand Isidore's attack once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the Sacred Crystals in the energy core were burning wildly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blocking Isidore's two attacks consumed a total of 100,000 Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't afford to feel heartbroken at this moment because he noticed Isidore was even angrier. He launched a third attack, more powerful than the previous two.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Osborne took the Warfare Shield from the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He activated the Warfare Shield. Instantly, a faint Warfare Mist spread out, enveloping the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and the surrounding environment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew the Warfare Mist he unleashed with the Warfare Shield couldn't withstand Isidore's attack. He did it only to share some of the pressure on the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, if the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's shield was breached, he would surely die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Mr. Rivera, please hurry up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew such passive defense couldn't last long. But he had no better option and could only pray that Uriah and the other two would quickly complete their fusion with the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Isidore's third attack arrived. The Warfare Mist emitted by the Warfare Shield shattered completely almost instantly upon resisting Isidore's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the shield of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum also began to shatter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The clear sound of the shield shattering sank Osborne's heart to the bottom. Just then, other warriors in the Empyrean Sacredness from Elf City arrived. Without hesitation, they launched a frenzied attack on the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although their strength was far inferior to Isidore's, at this moment, they were like the last straw that broke the camel's back. With a loud boom, the shield of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum completely collapsed the instant their attacks landed.</span></p></div>
