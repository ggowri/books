        <h1>Chapter 2671 The Mutation in the Jungle</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly noticed that the distant jungle began to shake violently, radiating an incredibly dazzling light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, streaks of light flashed, shooting out from the jungle at incredible speed. Hundreds of them darted in all directions and vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the streaks of light shot straight toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was about to dodge but noticed that the streak of light was actually an emperor fruit!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne reached out and caught the emperor fruit, immediately feeling the dense spiritual energy in his palm. It was indeed a genuine emperor fruit, capable of quickly boosting strength once consumed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, for Osborne, the side effects of these emperor fruits were too severe. They could cause his soul power to go berserk, potentially shattering his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had previously obtained hundreds of such emperor fruits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit lost at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought to himself, "Why did hundreds of emperor fruits suddenly fly out of that forest? Those emperor fruits scattered to every corner of the Ancient Battlefield, and one of them landed precisely in front of me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt as if that forest had willingly gifted it to me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's going on?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why did that forest suddenly glow? This is so strange!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A surge of powerful spiritual energy made Osborne feel all his pores open up, incredibly comfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's body uncontrollably moved toward the forest, as if something inside was drawing him in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Something's wrong!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's Soul Current Ocean rippled, calming him down instantly. Without hesitation, he stepped back, retreating to a spot farther from the forest, staring at it with a grave expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial appeared on Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial frowned at the forest and said, "There's definitely something strange about this forest! The spiritual energy it emits actually makes me feel an urge to go in! Osborne, I suggest you step back further."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is obviously bait!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even without Primordial saying it, Osborne also felt something was off. He quickly retreated further away, suddenly his expression changed, and he looked behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Someone's coming!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly hid in a pile of ruins.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used the Sublime Concealment Orb to hide himself. Unless someone searched the ruins, no one could find him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he hid, a figure quickly appeared nearby, rushing toward the forest at incredible speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a warrior of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne recognized this man. He was the leader of a certain First-rate Power. Previously, to survive, he had already submitted to Frederick, and he was among the first to enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "This man's strength has increased a lot compared to before!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyone who entered the Eighth Skyfall Casket, as long as they didn't die, would more or less gain strength! Before entering the Skyfall Casket, this person was just an ordinary Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, but now he's comparable to a Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In just over twenty days, his strength has probably increased more than what he could achieve in hundreds or even thousands of years of cultivation!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the man was holding an emperor fruit in his hand. He finally stopped at the edge of the forest, gazing into its depths with excitement and thrill in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, he was drawn here by the spiritual energy emanating from the forest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What does he want to do? Will he enter the forest?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very curious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne wasn&rsquo;t the only cautious one. Although this man&rsquo;s eyes were filled with excitement, thrill, and even greed, he didn&rsquo;t rush straight into the forest. Instead, he stopped outside and carefully observed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, he also felt something was off about this forest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On this Ancient Battlefield, not even a blade of grass could grow, yet here appeared such a forest, emitting spiritual energy identical to that of the emperor fruit in his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was obviously abnormal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he really wanted to rush into the forest to get more emperor fruits, he ultimately held back. He even followed Osborne&rsquo;s example and hid in some nearby ruins.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t know that all his actions were being watched by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This guy is really cautious!" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked in another direction. Over there, several powerful forces were rapidly approaching and soon appeared in front of the forest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A total of three people, each one a warrior of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was all too familiar with these three.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were Weston, Quinn, and Naomi!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he saw these three, Osborne's heart ignited with intense hatred and killing intent. He wished he could rush out immediately and capture all three of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted revenge!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to torment and humiliate them just like he did to Hendrix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, Osborne held back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They also gained immense benefits from the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked serious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the energy they emitted was far stronger than when they first entered the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, among the three, only Weston was a Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, while Quinn and Naomi were merely Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne sensed the aura of Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness from Quinn and Naomi.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the energy emanating from Weston was even more terrifying than before!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his strength had even surpassed Adriana before entering the Skyfall Casket. Even if he wasn't a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean yet, he was close.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Their strength has improved so tremendously!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly. "It seems the place they were in is quite suitable for hunting astral projections... All three already possess the strength of Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. One-on-one, I wouldn't be afraid, but one-on-three..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's see how things go first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued to hide in the ruins.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston and the other two arrived in front of the forest, feeling the energy emanating from within, extremely excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Quinn murmured, "Such dense spiritual energy! There must be a large number of emperor fruits inside! Maybe even resources and treasures more advanced than emperor fruits! Once we enter, we'll have the chance to break our limits and become Supreme True Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at Weston and Naomi beside him and said, "I'll go ahead first! The first to break through and become an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior will be me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Quinn rushed into the forest without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston and Naomi both frowned at this moment. They had a faint feeling that something was off about this forest, but since Quinn had already rushed in, they suddenly became a bit anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston angrily said, "I can't let Quinn be the first to break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am the strongest prince of the Royal Family! I won't allow anyone to surpass me! No one is allowed to threaten my position!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Weston also rushed into the forest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi didn't hesitate for long. She gritted her teeth and said coldly, "This is my chance to surpass Weston! It's also my chance to break free from my father's control! I must gain the power to break through and become Imperial Empyrean Sacredness here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So what if this forest is dangerous?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must go in!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Naomi also rushed into the forest.</span></p></div>
