        <h1>Chapter 553 The Dark Elemental Power</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? You didn't lose your head?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, a voice suddenly echoed in Osborne's ear, filled with astonishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The voice belonged to David, who now emerged from the shadows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He furrowed his brows and, with a swift motion, slashed his black dagger toward Osborne's throat once again, moving with lightning speed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, Osborne was prepared. He kicked out at David, landing a solid blow that sent David reeling backward, and Osborne quickly withdrew at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Osborne wasn't unscathed either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even after being kicked, David maintained control of his dagger, managing to land another cut on Osborne's throat. Blood spurted more violently from the fresh wound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David was thrown to a distance, where he brushed off his chest and smirked with a mocking expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's over!" he declared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He held the black dagger with an air of contempt, watching Osborne's blood spray from the wound in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought you'd be more of a challenge, but you're just as weak as the rest. Two cuts from me, and even if you don't die, you'll be seriously injured. What a disappointment. You should just surrender now; it's better to be eliminated than to die here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David finished his words with a cold sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face turned pale as he pressed his hand to his throat, feeling the blood gush out. A wave of fear washed over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David's attack had been too strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even after scanning the area twice with his Satan's Eye, Osborne hadn't detected David until he was already too close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, that black dagger was far too sharp!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was certain that David had intended to kill him, aiming to sever his head. It was only thanks to Osborne's martial art aura and his formidable physical defense that he had managed to survive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glared coldly at David, his eyes filled with a chilling intensity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Over? You're celebrating too early! Those two strikes didn't finish me off. Now it's my turn!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne spoke coldly, he felt a frigid power emanate from the Satan's Eye, flooding into the wound on his throat. The terrifying gash began to heal rapidly, the bleeding stopping in the blink of an eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David's eyes widened in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is that possible? How can you heal so quickly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smirked. "Curious? Too bad I'm not telling you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kill!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne launched a fierce attack on David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He noticed that Rodney was rapidly approaching from the distance, and further off, Sam appeared to have received the news and was hurrying over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David's expression darkened. Faced with Osborne's attack, he chose not to engage directly. Instead, he vanished into the shadows, causing Osborne's strike to hit nothing but air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did he disappear? What kind of power is this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He once again scanned the area with the Satan's Eye but still couldn't detect David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's impossible. How could he vanish so completely?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne found it hard to believe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the Satan's Eye couldn't locate David, it meant David could assassinate him at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did that mean he had become a sitting duck?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As this thought crossed his mind, Osborne frantically activated the Satan's Eye, pushing its power to the limit. Finally, he saw it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There, within the shadows cast by the trees, a faint human-like figure stood silently, seemingly waiting for an opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Merged with the shadows?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could it be a dark elemental power? Such an ability is incredibly rare, no more common than space elemental power."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was surprised but didn't show it, keeping his expression serious as if he hadn't discovered David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If David really has a dark elemental power, merging with the shadows would make his body intangible, allowing him to evade most attacks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Attacking him now would likely be futile!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I need to force him out of hiding if I want to land a hit!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that in mind, Osborne moved quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He scoffed loudly. "Hiding, are you? Fine, stay hidden then. If I can't beat you, I can always run. With my spatial power, I can leave whenever I want!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, Osborne tore open a dimensional rift as if to escape through it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, out of the corner of his eye, Osborne saw David finally move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David flickered through the shadows, quickly appearing behind Osborne's shadow. His black dagger gleamed as it emerged from the shadows, followed by David's body. His face twisted into a contemptuous smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Trying to flee from me? That's a death wish!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David gripped his dagger and stabbed viciously toward Osborne's heart from his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The dagger moved with lightning speed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Osborne hadn't already spotted him, it would have been nearly impossible to react, let alone defend himself, much less counterattack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, Osborne was ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just before David struck, Osborne spun around and delivered a powerful kick backward, channeling all the strength he had prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're the one courting death!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne's foot lashed out, he couldn't entirely avoid David's dagger. He shifted slightly to protect his heart, allowing the blade to pierce his body but not hit anything vital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Simultaneously, his kick landed squarely on David's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Puff!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David was sent flying by Osborne's kick, crashing through several massive trees before finally coming to a stop, coughing up blood furiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Osborne felt the sharp dagger slice through his back and protrude from his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Blood poured from the wound, gushing out from the dagger's groove.</p></div>
