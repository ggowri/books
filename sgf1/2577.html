        <h1>Chapter 2474 About to Be Caught Up</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious. He wasn't afraid of an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection because he had spatial power. In deep space, even an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection could only slowly chase behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, an unexpected situation had occurred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw that Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior wielding a long, sharp sword, continuously traversing through space, closing in on him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Supreme Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And it's a Supreme Sacred Artifact with built-in Phantom Steps ability!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt the pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His greatest reliance was his spatial power, allowing him to move fast enough in deep space. But now, the person behind him possessed a Supreme Sacred Artifact capable of traversing space, chasing him at a terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this rate, Osborne would soon be caught.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that with the Supreme Sacred Artifact, the speed of his Phantom Steps was even faster than his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luckily, every time he traverses twice, he has to stop and sense my location again! This is my chance. My speed may not match his, but I only need to escape, while he has to sense my location while chasing me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I still have a chance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne held nothing back and unleashed his full speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Huh? He can still speed up?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the person furiously chasing Osborne from behind looked a bit displeased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such speed... can someone below Empyrean Sacredness really possess this? His spatial power has actually reached this level? Perhaps his spatial power essence has already reached the Sacredness Level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Interesting! Truly interesting!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"An underling below Empyrean Sacredness with elemental essence reaching the Sacredness Level! This is rare indeed, no wonder he won the zone duel championship! They say he won by luck, but in my opinion..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's stronger than Brenda! There's a secret about him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, he immediately unleashed even greater power. The longsword in front of him emitted an even more commanding light as he chased after Osborne at an even faster speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if you have secrets, you can't escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior, if I let a mere underling who isn't even Empyrean Sacredness escape, I might as well bash my head in! I'll uncover the secrets on you! Those Kingdom Duel Scorepoints of yours will be mine too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sensed the pursuer behind him gaining speed, and his expression grew even more serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So fast!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it were someone else, they'd probably be caught by you soon! Just the Sacred Power consumption to maintain this speed isn't something ordinary people can handle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But catching me won't be that easy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth, pushing his limits once again to increase his speed. He was grateful that his spatial power essence had already broken through to the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, he would have been caught in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, I still need to find a way to further enhance my spatial power essence! After all, the stronger the spatial power essence, the better my chances of escaping!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, I haven't broken through to Empyrean Sacredness yet, so it's hard to improve my spatial power essence! Even with more Elven Sacred Water and entering the Enlightenment State again, it's still difficult to enhance it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unless I break through to Empyrean Sacredness! During the breakthrough, I can comprehend the world, and my elemental essence will improve again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pondered while fleeing for his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he and the person behind him maintained a chase-and-escape rhythm. Each time that person got closer, they had to stop to sense Osborne's position, giving Osborne a chance to widen the gap, so the pursuer could never catch up to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he couldn't shake off the other person either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two seemed to be locked in a war of attrition, waiting to see who would be unable to maintain this speed first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne was never afraid of a war of attrition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So what if the opponent was Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection? No matter how strong their Sacred Power was, it would eventually run out. But he had the Chaotic Spiritual Root and never had to worry about running out of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, why are you running for your life again?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial suddenly appeared on Osborne's shoulder and said somewhat speechlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While maintaining his speed to escape, he said, "You think I want to run for my life? It's because I gained too much on Abyssal Planet, and these people got greedy. Can't blame me for that!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ultimately, you're just too flashy! If this keeps up, I'm really afraid you'll get me killed one day..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes again, too lazy to bother with Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If you're not helping, fine, but mocking and ridiculing him here?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What level of opponents are chasing you? How about we just stop and fight them! With Flash here, why run from ordinary opponents? Just take them head-on!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial finally came up with his solution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's expression instantly froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued calmly, "Besides, there should be more than a dozen people behind, all either Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection or Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection! If I stop, they'll catch up quickly..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uh?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's eyes widened, then he hurriedly said, "Why aren't you running faster? Moving so slow, didn't you eat enough? Hurry! Faster! Speed up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't be bothered with Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial is sometimes reliable, but more often, extremely unreliable; talking to him is a waste of energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's still two days to reach that Chrono-Spatial Turbulence! If nothing unexpected happens, the person behind shouldn't catch up to me! I'm not afraid of a battle of attrition..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, that's only if nothing unexpected happens! Two days is too long, I'm just worried something might go wrong!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perhaps I should look for another Chrono-Spatial Turbulence! In deep space, the last thing lacking is Chrono-Spatial Turbulence. Instead of traveling two days to reach that one, it might be better to find a new one..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne immediately started searching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Various kinds of Chrono-Spatial Turbulence flow through deep space, and no one knows which direction they will drift. They distort time and space, blocking all perception.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, these Chrono-Spatial Turbulences seemed too small to Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even an ordinary Empyrean Sacredness warrior could easily navigate through these Chrono-Spatial Turbulences. Relying on them to shake off the pursuers behind was simply impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne needed a Chrono-Spatial Turbulence that was massive and dangerous enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The kind of Chrono-Spatial Turbulence that even an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection wouldn't dare to enter!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne kept searching hard, but he never came across one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne suddenly felt that the person behind him had sped up again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? He can still speed up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was shocked, and the next second, an extremely furious voice echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, you can't escape! To catch up with you, I've already burned my blood essence! Although this will damage my body, for the 46 billion plus Kingdom Duel Scorepoints on you, it's all worth it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By burning blood essence, my speed can at least double! In just a few breaths, I'll catch up to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now I order you, stop immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand over all your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints willingly, and I promise not to harm your life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, if I catch up to you, I will kill you!"</span></p></div>
