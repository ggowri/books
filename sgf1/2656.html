        <h1>Chapter 2539 Genius and Waste</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela stared at Osborne in shock, completely unable to believe that he could build a Cosmic Translocator on his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Even counting the one month in the Phantomagic Realm, Osborne has spent less than two months learning to build the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne learned to build a Cosmic Translocator in less than two months, then what does it mean that I took three years to learn how to repair one and even felt proud about it? Is my brain underdeveloped?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela frowned, thinking Osborne might have learned it wrong, and thought, "Osborne thinks he has learned it, but he hasn't actually built a Cosmic Translocator, so he doesn't realize he got it wrong. Besides, even if Osborne really learned to build a Cosmic Translocator, it&rsquo;s useless in the current situation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Osborne, there&rsquo;s no Cosmic Translocator near that resource-bearing planet, so even if you build one here, we can&rsquo;t locate the one on the other side, and transmission won&rsquo;t be possible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne smiled and said, "I know. So, what I&rsquo;m building isn&rsquo;t a Two-way Cosmic Translocator that requires another one to pair with, but a One-way Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have the coordinates of that resource-bearing planet. The One-way Cosmic Translocator can send us directly there. Although the location might not be exact and we can&rsquo;t land precisely on the planet, we&rsquo;ll definitely be nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, we&rsquo;ll be able to get there quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne spoke, he had already gathered all the materials needed to build a One-way Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne got to work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela was shocked, thinking, "What did Osborne just say? Is he building a One-way Cosmic Translocator?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having studied the construction of Cosmic Translocators for some time, Angela knew very well that building a One-way Cosmic Translocator was more complex and challenging than building a Two-way Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Has Osborne not only learned to build a Cosmic Translocator but also mastered building a One-way Cosmic Translocator?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela felt even more incredulous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was about to continue speaking when she saw Osborne already in action. With a wave of his hand, a pile of materials instantly flew into the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, under Osborne's precise control of Sacred Power, the materials began to move on their own, aligning, combining, melting, welding, and undergoing various complex transformations, leaving Angela utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Osborne's control, hundreds of different materials danced as if choreographed, transforming one by one into the shapes Osborne needed and settling into their correct positions. In just over ten seconds, the prototype of a Cosmic Translocator appeared in the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a hexagram.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this was just the beginning. Next, Osborne had to perform more intricate operations to fully utilize the effectiveness of each material and link them together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for Osborne, this was no problem at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could even build a Level Three Cosmic Translocator now. At this moment, he was merely constructing a Level One Cosmic Translocator, and even though it was a One-way Cosmic Translocator, it posed no challenge for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was Osborne's first time building a Cosmic Translocator, he had already simulated it countless times in his mind and was very familiar with every step.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hands moved continuously. Then, the Cosmic Translocator in the void became increasingly precise and stable, beginning to emit faint energy fluctuations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela was stunned. "How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Cosmic Translocator was not yet fully constructed, Angela felt everything was fine and believed that what Osborne was building truly seemed to be a complete Level One Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, she couldn't spot any issues.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Osborne's construction speed was incredibly fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just about two minutes, a Level One One-way Cosmic Translocator had basically taken shape. From a repair perspective, Angela examined it and found no issues&mdash;it was absolutely flawless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, this Cosmic Translocator was even more perfect than most Cosmic Translocators she had ever seen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela took a deep breath, utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha curiously watched Osborne's actions. She didn't understand the Cosmic Translocator, so she had no idea how astonishing Osborne's behavior was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, after seeing Angela's expression, Agatha more or less understood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she was also very shocked at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Osborne swiftly build the Cosmic Translocator, her eyes were filled with admiration, unable to look away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a few more seconds, an incredibly intense spatial power suddenly emanated from beside Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Space Coherence!" Osborne said. Then, he stopped all his actions. Looking at the Level One One-way Cosmic Translocator in the void, he felt very satisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I did it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne used spatial power to connect the Cosmic Translocator with the surrounding space and opened a passage, the Cosmic Translocator was finally completed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it took less than three minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This means Osborne's previous learning had no issues. In practice, he could construct the Cosmic Translocator at the same speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! We can teleport now," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to look at Angela and Agatha. Seeing the shocked expressions on their faces, he found it somewhat amusing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "I just built a Cosmic Translocator on my own. Is it necessary for them to be this shocked? It's just a Level One Cosmic Translocator. If they knew I could independently build a Level Three Cosmic Translocator, wouldn't they be even more stunned?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wake up! It's time to go," Osborne said again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela and Agatha finally came to their senses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela took a deep breath and said, "Don't rush. Let me study it first. I'll check if this Cosmic Translocator has any issues."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She really couldn't believe that Osborne could independently build a Level One Cosmic Translocator, let alone a One-way Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although this Cosmic Translocator seemed fine on the surface, she worried that some other aspects might not have been done properly, which could cause issues with the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If something goes wrong, they could face danger during the teleportation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela quickly rushed over and started carefully studying the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to find the problem with it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after a long time, Angela was shocked to find no issues at all. This Cosmic Translocator seemed perfect in her eyes, capable of pushing the teleportation distance to its absolute limit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Perfect! Perfect! It's absolutely perfect everywhere."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela was completely stunned and turned to look at Osborne as if he were a monster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't rush Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, it was his first time actually building a Cosmic Translocator, and he hoped Angela could help check if there were any issues he wasn't aware of.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, seeing Angela's expression, Osborne knew there was no problem with this Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want to waste any more time, so he said, "Let's go now. I've already adjusted the direction and coordinates for the teleportation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela was too shocked to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she nodded. "Osborne, you're truly a genius. You're the most brilliant genius I've ever seen. Compared to you, I feel like I'm completely useless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Angela stepped onto the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne awkwardly touched his nose and said, "I just have a bit of talent in this area. It's nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Angela glared at him. "A bit of talent? Then I feel even more like a useless person."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, Osborne fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He and Agatha also stepped onto the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne activated the Cosmic Translocator. Filled with excitement and anticipation, their figures vanished instantly.</span></p></div>
