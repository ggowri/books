        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your competition token!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earvin handed Osborne a small token, its surface displaying a screen with a single number&mdash;0.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this?" Osborne asked, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earvin explained, "You should know that this Sect Tournament for Mystic Sirius Sect is essentially a qualifying round for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. This token is called the Kingdom </span><span>Duel</span><span> Token!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The number on it represents your Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. You can exchange these points for cultivation resources or various treasures. Just one Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoint</span><span> can be traded for at least one Sacred Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, earning Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> isn't easy! If you manage to stand out in Mystic Sirius Sect, your rank will determine how many points you earn&mdash;anywhere from ten to a hundred Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tenth place nets you ten points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ninth place gets you twenty, and eighth place earns thirty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The champion of Mystic Sirius Sect? That's a whopping hundred points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can make it into the top ten, you'll represent Mystic Sirius Sect at the Tempest Fortress City's city duel. If you do well there, you could earn a thousand to ten thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The higher your rank, the more </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> you'll rack up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can shine in the Zephyr State's city duel, you're looking at a hundred thousand to a million </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>! And if you make it through the Eastern Zone 3 battle, that could skyrocket to ten million or even a hundred million points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you finally reach the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, the rewards will be even greater! Those Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> can be exchanged for items from the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury&mdash;everything from cultivation resources to divine artifacts and Sacred Artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, put in the effort!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can land in the top ten of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel... the rewards you could exchange for with those </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> would be unimaginable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Earvin spoke, he shook his head, a hint of skepticism in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, at Ascension Seven, standing out in Mystic Sirius Sect is already a stretch. Just avoiding embarrassment would be a win for him. The idea of competing in the city duel, the state duel, the zone duel, or even the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel? That's just wishful thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne felt a spark of excitement igniting within him.</span><br><span>One Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoint</span><span> can at least be exchanged for one Sacred Crystal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If I fight my way through and make it to the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, I could potentially earn millions, even hundreds of millions of </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's an incredible </span><span>amount</span><span> of Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but gasp, a wave of astonishment washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back on Umbra Earth, he had worked hard to gather fifty thousand Sacred Crystals and thought that was a fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with a good performance in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, he could be looking at over a hundred million Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was an astounding prospect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that kind of wealth, he wouldn't have to worry about resources after breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's desire to enter the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and achieve a stellar performance grew even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he also understood that such substantial rewards would attract talented warriors from across the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom, making it even harder to stand out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for the insight, Mr. Earvin </span><span>Corenswet</span><span>! I'm going to prepare seriously! I won't let Peak Seven down in the Sect Tournament in half a month!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took his leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earvin watched him go, shaking his head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another dreamer! At Ascension Seven, he thinks he can earn Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>? What a joke! Does he think our Ascension Ten core disciples are just decorations? He'll be lucky to avoid embarrassment, let alone crack the top ten and earn </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!"</span></p></div>
