        <h1>Chapter 764 I'm Here for You</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, I can feel it too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma suddenly stopped, her face lighting up with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's this special energy from my Death's Stare flowing into you. Do you think this is what's boosting our insight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was surprised. "You can feel it too? It must be the source of the boost."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he was still puzzled about how the unique energy from Emma's Death's Stare was influencing his brain, the results were clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This energy wasn't just making his mind sharper. It was dramatically enhancing his insight, making cultivation feel almost effortless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne noticed Emma's expression had turned serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma bit her lip nervously. "Osborne, I think the special energy in my Death's Stare is running out. We might have just a few more chances before it's all used up and transferred to you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When it's gone, will I still matter to you? Will you still want to have sex with me? Will you still love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes were filled with concern, and she looked at him as if afraid he might leave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She murmured, "I wish this energy could last forever. If it did, I could always help you with your insight, and you'd always need me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice trailed off, barely above a whisper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was touched by her worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled softly and gently cupped her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We've already gained a lot from this energy. It's a bit much to wish it would last forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And I'm not the kind of guy who just walks away. No matter what happens, I'm here for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's face brightened with a mix of relief and joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded reassuringly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's face lit up with a smile as she threw herself into his arms. "Osborne, thank you so much! Don't worry, I'm not going to compete with Clarissa for any position. I'm perfectly happy as long as you care about me. I don't care about status or whether you'll marry me or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hugged him tightly and playfully wiggled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was a bit surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This wasn't the first time he'd heard such words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Austin had said similar things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of Austin, he felt a pang of guilt. He had been so busy lately that he hadn't kept in touch with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll bring Austin to Newport City once the ceremony is over," he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly refocused on Emma, and they both took advantage of the boost in their insight to dive back into their cultivation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By morning, Osborne hadn't quite mastered Thunder Realm yet, but he felt he was very close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe by tonight, he'd get it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mastering three realms in just two days? People would probably think I'm insane if they knew!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne chuckled, giving Emma a light pat on the rear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Time to get up, Emma!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Today's arena battle is going to be a thrill. Rhett's aiming for the Godson Rankings, and we can't miss it. We need to save your special energy and use it wisely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma nodded sleepily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They quickly dressed and left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart, Vivian, and others were also awake, though they looked a bit tired, likely due to concerns about the Eityreia Organization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long after, Rhett showed up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go! We're heading to the arena battle! Today, I'm going to make it onto the Godson Rankings!" he said, his face serious as he led the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group soon arrived back at the Williamson family's castle. The three arenas in front of the castle had been combined into one massive stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Below the arena, a sea of young elites was eagerly awaiting the action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne spotted Satoru and Clay among the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were also many other formidable figures, their powerful auras and intense determination showing they were all aiming to break into the Godson Rankings today.</p></div>
