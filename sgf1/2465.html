        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Warriors need to break their limits again and again," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he felt that his current strength had reached its limit, this limit could be broken; he just needed to find the right direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne had no master.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his previous life, he only cultivated to Ascension Nine. His current achievements had already surpassed those of his past life. Osborne no longer knew how to continue improving his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe I can ask Primordial," Osborne thought, summoning Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, after absorbing fifty Frost-kissed Hearts, </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> strength had also greatly improved. Now, it was at Quasi Empyrean Sacredness. With one more advancement, it could become a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne even felt that Primordial might break through to Empyrean Sacredness before him. Osborne could also sense how terrifying </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> strength was. Even though Osborne had fused five types of power, he still felt pressure from Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's</span><span> strength might not be much weaker than Osborne's current power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne explained the problem he encountered </span><span>to</span><span> Primordial. Primordial immediately fell into deep thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It said, "To be honest, your current situation amazes me. You haven't broken through to Empyrean Sacredness, yet you've already fused five types of power. Most importantly, each of these five powers is incredibly strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your Sacred Power is stronger than most warriors at primary Empyrean Sacredness. Even though I'm an offshoot of the World Tree, considered a Primordial Creature, at the same cultivation level as you, I absolutely couldn't defeat you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Without breaking through your cultivation level, even I am unsure how you can enhance your strength. However, we can analyze it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "I shouldn't just think about how to defeat warriors below Empyrean Sacredness now, but rather how to defeat warriors at Empyrean Sacredness. What should I do to have a higher chance of winning against warriors at primary Empyrean Sacredness, or even mid Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "Don't rush. Let's analyze this step by step. First, for you, your strength can be broken down into the level of cultivation, the intensity of Sacred Power, the strength of Sacred Artifacts, and the mastery of combat techniques."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want to continue enhancing your strength, you can only start from these aspects. First, you just broke through Ascension Ten. In the short term, it's almost impossible for you to break through and become a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness. In my opinion, you won't be able to reach Empyrean Sacredness within at least six months."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is based on the fact that you have time powers, allowing you to train in a hundredfold time acceleration. Otherwise, it would take you even longer to become a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness. So, you can stop considering relying on breaking through your cultivation level to enhance your strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, fully agreeing with </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Between Quasi Empyrean Sacredness and Empyrean Sacredness lies a massive gap, and breaking through it is not easy. Otherwise, the number of warriors at Empyrean Sacredness wouldn't be so scarce.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's talent is strong enough. He won't encounter any bottlenecks when breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness. However, he just broke through Ascension Ten. Unless he obtains some powerful Sacred Elixir that can directly enhance his cultivation level, it will take him a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said Osborne couldn't break through to Empyrean Sacredness within six months. This aligns closely with Osborne's own judgment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pausing for a moment, Osborne continued, "Next is the intensity of Sacred Power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your current Sacred Power intensity has almost reached the limit below Empyrean Sacredness. You're now at the Supernal Deity King Level, but you've already fused five types of power in advance. I've never seen anything like this, not even heard of it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But limits are meant to be broken. Since you've already fused five types of power, you can absolutely try to fuse a sixth. Of course, it's very difficult."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In my opinion, it's almost impossible for you to succeed. If you can find thousands of Frost-kissed Hearts and fully absorb them, maybe you might achieve it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you can try to fuse more powers, but you shouldn't be too fixated. If you succeed, that would be great. However, failing is more normal."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want to continue fusing more powers to enhance the intensity of Sacred Power, it's very unlikely to succeed. In that case, you can only improve the quality of the fused powers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Among the five powers you've fused now, the elemental essences of dark power, spatial power, Thunder Power, and fire power have all reached the highest Ascension Ten. This is already the limit before breaking through Empyrean Sacredness. But in my view, this limit can be surpassed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can continue to enhance the elemental essences. With your comprehension, you can break them through Ascension Ten to reach the Sacredness Level, just like your physical body. Your physical body has not only broken through to the Sacredness Level but even reached the mid Sacredness Level, almost approaching the advanced Sacredness Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If any of these four elemental essences can break through to the Sacredness Level, the intensity of your Sacred Power can continue to increase."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you can break all of them through to the Sacredness Level, no one below Empyrean Sacredness would likely withstand a single attack from you. Ordinary warriors at primary Empyrean Sacredness might be easily defeated by you. You could even fight against warriors at mid Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing this, Osborne immediately became excited. "Breaking my elemental essence through to the Sacredness Level? That might not be so easy, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course," Primordial said calmly, "if you want to break your elemental essence through to the Sacredness Level, you need incredibly strong comprehension. Most people can't achieve this before breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness. They can only enhance their elemental essence to Empyrean Sacredness when their cultivation level breaks through Empyrean Sacredness, relying on the vast World Insights they gain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, your comprehension is strong. Perhaps you can break your elemental essence through to the Sacredness Level before your cultivation level reaches Empyrean Sacredness. In that case, when your cultivation level breaks through to Empyrean Sacredness, the vast World Insights can make your elemental essence even stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very excited and nodded firmly. He already had a goal and decided to continue enhancing his elemental essence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He aimed to elevate the elemental essence of his spatial power, dark power, Thunder Power, and fire power to the Sacredness Level before his cultivation level broke through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial continued, "Next, let's analyze your Sacred Artifact. However, there's not much to analyze about your Sacred Artifact. The </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, Warfare Shield, Warfare Scythe, Solar Battleship, and Ascending Sacred Sanctum are already sufficient for you to use."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, the Warfare Ancient Tree can constantly enhance the power of these Sacred Artifacts for you, so there's nothing you need to do. Right now, even if you had a more powerful Sacred Artifact, you wouldn't be able to unleash its full potential."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, feeling that </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> words made a lot of sense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "Finally, let's analyze your combat techniques. In my opinion, you have tremendous potential for improvement in this area. The Divine Ascendance Technique you currently master isn't very strong and has significant limitations."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Among all your techniques, only 'Maw Arrow' is decent. However, Maw Arrow has too many limitations. Your Sacred Power is a fusion of five different forces, but Maw Arrow only integrates the Divine Ascendance Technique of dark power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maw Arrow can't fully unleash your true power. Next, you need to comprehend a combat technique unique to you that can fully utilize all your strength. Unfortunately, you don't have a master. You'll have to figure it out on your own."</span></p></div>
