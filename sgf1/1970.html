        <h1>Chapter 1969 Absolute Guardianship</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate for a moment. With the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he enveloped all of Hope Haven in his perception, meticulously duplicating the life essence of every individual within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This process required no consent from anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, each person who had their life essence copied now bore a crimson lotus tattoo on their arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This symbol represented absolute guardianship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Hannah, Diana, Kendra, Bryce, and even Sebastian, Divine Shadow, God of Star, along with all the members of the Blood Demon, found the same blood-red lotus etched on their skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, this phenomenon sparked a wave of confusion among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emerging from their meditative states, Anastasia and the others gathered, curiosity etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne appeared before them in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry! This is absolute guardianship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly explained the effects of this new power, leaving everyone stunned, their expressions a mix of disbelief and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we're immortal now?" one of them exclaimed, eyes wide with wonder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we die, we can come back?" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're invincible!" a third shouted, the thrill palpable in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere buzzed with exhilaration, but Osborne quickly doused their enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on! Just having immortality doesn't mean you're invincible! True invincibility comes from strength, not immortality!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For example, if I know you're immortal, I could choose not to kill you but instead imprison you, torturing you day in and day out until you're driven to despair. You wouldn't be able to use your immortality to come back, just stuck in endless suffering!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words cast a shadow over the group, their excitement evaporating as they contemplated the grim scenario he painted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their somber expressions, Osborne felt a sense of satisfaction. "But there's no need to panic! That's an extreme situation! With absolute guardianship, your safety is much more assured. As long as you don't take unnecessary risks, it's unlikely anyone will manage to capture you alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded in agreement, the tension easing slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then turned his attention to Anastasia. "Anastasia, it seems your Divine Body hasn't improved in a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded. "The yellow Miracle Elixir isn't doing anything for me anymore! I've tried pushing my limits, but it's clear my Divine Body has hit its peak. I plan to break through soon and aim for the Supernal Deity King level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne acknowledged her determination with a nod and glanced at Zoe and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've also found that the yellow Miracle Elixir has little effect on us now! Our Divine Bodies are stuck at the pinnacle of Level Nine, and we can't seem to progress further!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've decided that once Anastasia breaks through, we'll follow suit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Even if you're at the pinnacle of Level Nine, you're already among the elite in Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Divine Bodies of the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings can't even compare to your strength! Plus, once your Divine Bodies merge with the Divine Flame, there's a chance they could evolve into Level Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While you all stay here to break through, I'm stepping out for a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne left Hope Haven and made his way to Hudson Valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere there was significantly more vibrant. With a staggering five million members of the Hudson family, the place buzzed with energy as they fervently trained and elevated their powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been ten years since they had entered their meditative states.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that time, with the help of endless Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs, every member of the Hudson family had experienced tremendous growth in their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for the few children who hadn't yet come of age, nearly every member of the Hudson family had reached the pinnacle of the Deity Overlord level. Among them, at least 500 thousand had broken through to the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five hundred thousand Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at the height of the Hudson family's power, the number of Deity King warriors had never exceeded 50 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, that figure had skyrocketed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of peak Deity Kings had surged from just over a thousand to an astounding 50 thousand, with more members reaching this level every single day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an immense force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the outside world remained unaware of this transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, Osborne's uncles and aunts had all completed their breakthroughs, attaining the status of Supernal Deity Kings. Over a hundred talented members of the Hudson family had also managed to reach this level, thanks to the abundance of Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The total number of Supernal Deity Kings in the Hudson family had surged to over one hundred sixty, and this number was rising daily, with the pace accelerating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As more and more Hudson family members reached the peak of the Deity King level, they began to push for breakthroughs to Supernal Deity King. If they failed, they were granted Miracle Elixirs, allowing them to enhance their talents and potential before attempting again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, the strength of the Hudson family was climbing rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were advancing in their cultivation level, they didn't neglect their battlefield skills. Every day, tens of thousands of Deity King warriors practiced on the training grounds, forming battle formations that would make even Osborne's heart race with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything is heading in a positive direction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Hudson family is given enough time, who knows what could happen... but time is running short!" Osborne thought, surveying the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he finished copying the life essence of every member, he made his way to the family's conference hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the hall, Osborne found his uncles and aunts gathered, their expressions serious as they examined the crimson lotus tattoos on their arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Osborne, they paused their discussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look who's back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His relatives surrounded him, their faces lighting up with smiles. Each of them appeared younger, a testament to their recent breakthroughs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scanned the room, puzzled. "Where's Grandpa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary chimed in, "Osborne, your grandpa went to the Sanctum of Light! The esteemed God of Light summoned all Dukedom Level Powers from the human race to discuss strategies against the Dark Deity Legion. He's been gone for several years now... but from our perspective, only a few days have passed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned at this news. "Grandpa went to the Sanctum of Light?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hope he's okay! I haven't copied his life essence yet... but since I have the Binding Twin Pearl linked to him, I should be able to sense if he's in danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he felt a bit more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He addressed his relatives, "Uncle Zachary, the crimson lotus tattoos on your arms are a protective measure; there's no need for concern! Their presence is only beneficial, not harmful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne refrained from revealing the resurrection aspect of absolute guardianship, knowing it could be too frightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, no one pressed for more details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, so it was you who did this! You had us worried for a moment. If you say it's harmless, then we'll take your word for it! I'll go explain this to the others so they don't jump to conclusions!" Zachary said with a chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, about to say something more when suddenly his expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly waved his hand, and a pearl appeared before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Binding Twin Pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa's in trouble!"</span></p></div>
