        <h1>Chapter 173 Valentin Lashes Out at Apollo</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You threatening me?" Valentin glared daggers at Apollo, his eyes blazing with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take it as a threat or a piece of advice. Either way, I've made my stance clear, and it's up to you to decide what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aligning with the Chevalier family, Skyefall Security remains the top security company in Skyefall state. If you go against us...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then Skyefall Security might as well prepare for bankruptcy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Apollo leaned back in his chair, looking disdainfully at Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's face darkened, and just as he was about to speak, Judith grabbed his arm and whispered in his ear, "Mr. Gibson, don't lose your cool. We're no longer under the Draco Group, and we can't afford to offend the Chevalier family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think we should just agree. Sure, we lost the Draco Group as our backer, but this is our chance to hop on the Chevalier family's ship. That's the only way our company can keep growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, if the Chevalier family targets us and squeezes us out, we'll suffer big time, maybe even crash and burn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gibson, there are over a thousand people needing jobs. Don't be rash. A hundred million dollars is better than nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin coldly stared at Judith. "You want me to agree to this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith looked awkward but nodded. "Yes, I think we should. It's good for Skyefall Security. Even if the new boss were here, he'd definitely agree. He wouldn't want to cross the Chevalier family, would he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their voices were low, but everyone present was sharp-eared, catching every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faces varied, all waiting for the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Apollo remained calm as if he were sure Valentin wouldn't dare refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin glanced at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked frustrated. He thought Apollo would negotiate reasonably, but instead, he resorted to intimidation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no intention of agreeing anyway, and now it was even less likely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head at Valentin and quickly sent Valentin a text message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's phone pinged, and upon reading the message, his eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo smirked. "Valentin, have you made up your mind? Are you renting out the system for 100 million dollars, or are you picking a fight with my family and watching Skyefall Security go under?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin snorted coldly, "Apollo, are you delusional? Or are you thinking with your ass? If you're sick, go see a doctor, don't come here causing trouble. Get lost now, or don't blame me for being ruthless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Valentin spoke, the room fell into an eerie silence. Osborne, who had expected this, wore a smirk while everyone else was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had anticipated Valentin would curse so harshly, so crudely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's family wielded immense influence in both the underworld and the legitimate business in Skyefall, and Apollo was a contender for the Chevalier family's inheritance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People thought, "How dare Valentin talk to him like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Skyefall Security hadn't changed bosses and was still under the Draco Group, they wouldn't have the guts to challenge the Chevalier family, let alone offend them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's outburst left everyone in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all thought they had misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they felt Apollo was out of line, they didn't approve of Valentin burning bridges like this. He had completely crossed the Chevalier family, ready to take them on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wondered where Valentin got his nerve from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn looked astonished, almost admiring Valentin for doing what he had always wanted to do but couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, usually so aloof, now had a faint smile on her face as if enjoying Apollo's humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo trembled with rage, standing up abruptly, glaring at Valentin, and growling, "What did you say? Say it again if you dare."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin rolled his eyes and disdainfully replied, "You got problems with not only your brain but with your hearing, too? You want me to repeat the insult? Fine, listen up. Who do you think you are, spouting nonsense at Skyefall Security? You think you can rent our top-tier defense system for 100 million dollars? Go spend your money on a tombstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You moron, the Chevalier family will fall because of you. The more cocky you are now, the more pathetic you'll be later. Don't run back to Mommy when things go south?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's tirade was even fiercer and sharper than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was dumbfounded, Judith gaping in horror, gasping, "It's over. Skyefall Security is done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith looked at Valentin in disbelief. She had worked with him for years and had never seen him so fiery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered, "Could this be the new boss' directive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But whatever the case, Judith felt Skyefall Security was doomed, Valentin was doomed, and so was her new boss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo, furious, smashed a vase beside him, his eyes shooting fire, no longer able to maintain his noble demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill you," Apollo roared and charged forward.</span></p></div>
