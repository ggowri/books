        <h1>Chapter 912 Sin and Crimson</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden voice sent chills down Rumen and his children's spines, their faces paling in sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound had come from just behind them, and they hadn't sensed anyone approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For fighters of their caliber to be caught off guard like this was unnerving; if the intruders had intended to attack, they would have been severely injured&mdash;or worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's voice boomed as he instinctively shielded Marlon and Ebony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rumen, there's no need to panic," a smooth voice replied, laced with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another deeper voice came, sending another shiver down Rumen's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we wanted you dead, you'd already be a corpse. Why waste our breath?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He inhaled sharply, realizing that the threat wasn't just one person but two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as a top-tier Class S warrior, Rumen felt a prickling dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a thought struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it Sin and Crimson from the Eityreia Organization?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You figured it out," the female voice said, followed by the appearance of a middle-aged woman standing just a yard to Rumen's left, her gaze icy and unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, two figures emerged to his right: an unassuming middle-aged man and a strikingly beautiful woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was Scarlett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's heart raced as he registered the trio before him. They had managed to close the distance without him noticing, a feat that was both impressive and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had attacked... well, he didn't want to think about that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he took in their identities, Rumen's tension eased slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin and Crimson were a legendary duo, elite assassins ranked second and third on the assassin leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They held positions in the upper echelons of the Eityreia Organization and were ranked within the top fifty on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that if they teamed up for an assassination, even those in the top ten rankings would struggle to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't surprising that Rumen didn't notice the approach of such top-tier assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett was none other than their daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her extraordinary status stemmed directly from her lineage, a reflection of her powerful parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen regarded them with a serious expression. "Sin, Crimson, what do you mean by your earlier comments? You think you can handle the Night Witch? Aren't you worried about Shadow Killer's retaliation? Or the Court of the Sun?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin and Crimson exchanged glances, their expressions dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin, the man, spoke first in a low, gravelly tone, "Shadow Killer? There are ways to deal with him. As for the Court of the Sun... don't you think their reach is getting a bit too long?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson chimed in with a cold laugh, "Exactly. The Court of the Sun has overstepped its bounds. Twenty years ago, they orchestrated the global agreements forbidding superpowers from waging war over resources. That cut down global conflicts by ninety percent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that has severely impacted our business in the Eityreia Organization. I'm sure the League of Divine Descent has felt the sting as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen nodded slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin continued, "For us top-tier superpowers, being unable to engage in warfare with other nations feels like being bound hand and foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you League of Divine Descent have never considered taking down the Court of the Sun?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's expression hardened immediately. "You shouldn't say things like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, looks like you're still afraid of the Court of the Sun! Truth is, they aren't as terrifying as you think. Based on our investigations at the Eityreia Organization over the years, the Court of the Sun has very few members&mdash;certainly no more than ten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not more than ten? Are you sure?" Rumen was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! Our Stealth Arts are quite effective, as you must know. We haven't given up our investigation into the Court for the past twenty years. We can confirm that their numbers are definitely under ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, they're not that frightening after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we join forces, we could easily topple the Court of the Sun and throw the world back into the chaos it once knew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence radiated from Sin and Crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen, however, still wore a skeptical expression. "What if your intel is wrong? Taking on the Court of the Sun is a risk we can't afford to take."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin chuckled softly. "I figured you wouldn't dare confront the Court directly. So for now, let's not rush that. Instead, we can test the waters with Night Witch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you plan to do that?" Rumen asked, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By killing Osborne!" Sin and Crimson declared in unison.</span></p></div>
