        <h1>Chapter 2346 Calamity-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, Zebulon's body suddenly exploded. "Let's go to hell together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying force of the self-detonation instantly swept out, engulfing all ten black-masked warriors. The overwhelming power nearly evaporated the entire Moon Sea, causing the whole Zephyr State to tremble violently, with mountains collapsing and rivers reversing their flow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The self-destruction of a top warrior at the Empyrean Sacredness level was truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All ten black-masked warriors coughed up blood. Worried that using the Sacred Artifact would reveal their identities, they could only rely on Sacred Power for defense. However, the self-detonation was too terrifying; even with their combined efforts, they were still injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, they were only injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zebulon's self-detonation made them even angrier. After suppressing the explosion's power, they looked in the direction Agatha had fled, radiating killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them said, "Do you think you can escape like this? You're dreaming. And do you think stalling for time will bring support from the Ember Phoenix Clan deeper in the universe? That's ridiculous."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Ember Phoenix Clan deeper in the universe has others to hold them off. We have enough time to find the Dark Phoenix and completely kill her. Let's go after her quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ten black-masked warriors swiftly chased in the direction Agatha fled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Agatha spat out another mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry about me anymore. I can't hold on any longer. If you keep taking me with you, you'll be caught and killed too. I don't want you to die because of me," Agatha said, her eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To save her, Zebulon self-destructed. At this moment, only Vice Chief Finley Dempsey and twenty elders remained by her side. These were the last warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they also died, the Ember Phoenix Clan on the Racial Convergence Planet would be extinct.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha did not want such a thing to happen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Agatha, shut up. You are the Dark Phoenix, which makes you the hope of the Ember Phoenix Clan. The Ember Phoenix Clan will never abandon you. Besides, Mr. Hiram has already sacrificed himself to save you. How can you think of dying? Would this be fair to Mr. Hiram? Would this be fair to the clan members of the Ember Phoenix Clan who died for you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You not only can't die, but you also need to grow stronger quickly, avenge Mr. Hiram, avenge the clan members. You must take all of them down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must live well," Finley said through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, his expression suddenly changed. "No, they're catching up again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finley glanced around at the situation, feeling utterly hopeless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Now, only I, a top-tier warrior at Empyrean Sacredness, and twenty elders of the Ember Phoenix Clan are left. There's no way we can withstand those ten warriors with black masks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once we're caught, we'll all die, and Agatha will too. Then..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Finley made up his mind and quickly said to Agatha, "Agatha, the elders and I will hold off the enemy. But we won't last long. After that, it's up to you. Soon, I'll open a dimensional portal to send you into deep space."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Deep space is extremely complex. If you're lucky, you might survive. Remember, you are the Dark Phoenix, the hope of the Ember Phoenix Clan. No matter what happens, you must never give up easily."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must survive and quickly grow stronger. Only then will you be worthy of the Ember Phoenix Clan members sacrificing themselves for you. You must live on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Finley waved his hand. Instantly, he tore open a massive spatial rift, like the gaping maw of a giant beast, capable of devouring everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get in quickly." Finley forcefully threw Agatha inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! Don't!" Agatha shouted. But she couldn't stop anything and could only disappear into the dimensional portal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Finley revealed a pained smile. "This is all we can do. This is both the calamity and the hope of our Ember Phoenix Clan. Next, let's use our lives to make those ten bastards pay a price."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, flames and light erupted from their bodies, and they turned to charge at the ten warriors wearing black masks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were going to self-destruct together.</span></p></div>
