        <h1>Chapter 2217 Track</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maddox, you stay here in Phantom Tide City! Isa, we're going in together," Osborne commanded, his tone firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded, her expression determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly got to work, conjuring up two Spatial Clones. One of them morphed into a perfect replica of Isa, complete with her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we're ready to make our move, Maddox, you'll take these two Spatial Clones and find a spot in Phantom Tide City to show that we haven't left," he instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Osborne's features began to shift, transforming into that of a middle-aged man, his energy signature altering completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of his Sublime Concealment Orb, his disguise was flawless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Isa, standing right beside him, couldn't discern that the man before her was actually Osborne in disguise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Isa's disguise was much less sophisticated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's Satan's Eye, he could easily see through it, but he figured it was good enough. After all, most people didn't have the same abilities he did. It would be difficult for anyone to see through Isa's disguise unless they were significantly stronger than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Necoton Planet, only Bancroft could assert with confidence that he was stronger than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's roll!" Osborne announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were in disguise, he used his spatial power to open a dimensional portal leading outside the city. Then, together with Isa, they disappeared from the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they were outside Phantom Tide City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their figures briefly materialized before they slipped into a parallel space. Osborne activated his Satan's Eye to scan the area but didn't spot Vince's battleship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vince is going east. Let's go and take a look!" he said, and led Isa in that direction at a brisk pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on a huge battleship, Vince was surrounded by gorgeous women from the Human Community. Their alluring figures and radiant faces were accentuated by their skimpy outfits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vince Brunson, where are we going for our little escapade this time?" one of the women cooed, her voice oozing with allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince smirked and playfully groped her boobs. "Don't pry into things that aren't your concern! Just make sure I have a great time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he pulled her closer, his hands wandering freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Knock it off!" she gasped, her cheeks flushed with a mix of excitement and embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a cold voice cut through their flirtatious moment. "Mr. Vince Brunson, it's time to focus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince scowled at the interruption but finally let go of the woman, waving her off impatiently. "You girls go back to your rooms and wait for me! No one leaves without my permission, or you'll pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women's faces blanched at his threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly bowed their heads and scurried back to their cabins, leaving Vince alone in the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only one person remained, fully armored, glaring at Vince.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince, annoyed, snapped back, "Shelvin, what's the big hurry? We haven't even reached our destination yet! Can't I have some fun in the meantime?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shelvin replied calmly, "Mr. Vince Brunson, I'm here to guard you under Mr. Bancroft's orders. You know why we're here. Bringing those women on board violates the protocol! If any of them catch wind of our plan, it'll spell big trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince rolled his eyes, brushing off Shelvin's concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What protocol? What trouble? They're just my cover! Everyone in Phantom Tide City thinks I am just a woman-chaser out for a good time. It makes it easier for us to carry out our mission!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, since my father entrusted me with the slave trade, I'll decide how to handle it! I've done this countless times over the years, and nothing has ever gone wrong!" Vince declared, a hint of arrogance in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shelvin fell silent for a moment, contemplating Vince's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he spoke, "I'm just reminding you, Mr. Vince Brunson, to be a bit more cautious. After all, slave trading is a dirty business, and it can't afford any slip-ups. Even if your father can forgive you, the big shots on Racial Convergence Planet won't be so lenient..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get it, I get it!" Vince waved his hand dismissively. "There won't be any issues! Who in Necoton Planet or Phantom Tide City would dare mess with us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even those alien warriors have eyes on them; nobody's going to find out anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Vince strode to the battleship's deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the ship changed course, veering south into a dense jungle, quickly disappearing from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne and Isa were hot on their heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That battleship just vanished! There's a powerful force in this jungle blocking my Satan's Eye from seeing through!" Osborne's brow furrowed, his expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, he'd spotted Vince's ship and had been trailing it, biding his time to launch an attack in a more secluded spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unexpectedly, the ship had changed course and flown into the dense foliage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that the jungle could obstruct his view was a cause for alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exchanged a look with Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We might be onto a major operation here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vince isn't just out having a good time; that's just a smokescreen. He's got another motive for leaving the city!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slave trading!" they both blurted out at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's our next step? Should we follow them in?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With such a powerful barrier, won't we get caught if we try to force our way through?" Isa asked, her forehead wrinkled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared intently at the barrier in front of them, weighing their options. "I don't think we'll be detected! I can sense that this barrier is only meant to block my vision; it doesn't have any defensive functions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go and take a look!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he led Isa into the jungle. They slipped in unnoticed, and the surroundings remained deathly quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they got through the barrier, Osborne's Satan's Eye finally let him see what was going on inside the jungle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep in the jungle, he spotted a mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a concealed portal popped up. Vince's battleship was entering that portal and disappearing into the depths of the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The huge entrance quickly vanished, turning back into an ordinary rock face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't witnessed it with his own eyes, he'd have a hard time believing there was a secret entrance in the mountain that led to a hidden space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is definitely fishy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Osborne activated his spatial power and chased after the battleship into the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the mountain had been hollowed out completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All sorts of simple and haphazard structures filled the space, looking like a small city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Isa just stood there, taking in the sight, too shocked to say a word.</span></p></div>
