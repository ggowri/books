        <h1>Chapter 800 Tragic</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Cuthbert kept landing hits, Osborne's condition got worse. He was coughing up blood and looking super pale, like he might drop dead any second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone watching could see Osborne was on the ropes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Emma, Stuart, and Elder Aleena looked worried sick, their faces all drained of color.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The power difference is just too much!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm only Class AA, while Cuthbert's a top-tier Class AAA, almost Supreme Overlord level. Even with my Light Realm boost, he's still way out of my league!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even though Cuthbert's fought nearly fifty matches and Emma sucked out a bunch of his life force, making him way weaker than usual, beating him is still a long shot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he felt like crap from all the injuries, Osborne didn't back down or show any fear. His eyes were still blazing with determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he knew his chance was coming soon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's power was indeed terrifying. Even with Osborne using the&nbsp;Breath of Celestial, he was still overpowered. Even if he revealed his true strength and transformed into his&nbsp;Blood Clan&nbsp;form, he might still be weaker than Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne could sense that Cuthbert's aura was rapidly weakening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Such powerful attacks weren't easy to sustain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even someone like Cuthbert couldn't keep this up. Each powerful strike drained him heavily. His face had turned pale, and he was now panting heavily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just lose already!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert was furious. He could feel the toll his relentless attacks were taking on his energy, and while Osborne was badly injured, he refused to fall, like an immovable stone, which only fueled Cuthbert's anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, Cuthbert didn't care about the Honor Quest Ceremony anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All he wanted now was to defeat Osborne and complete his fifty-match winning streak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another devastating attack hit Osborne, and even with his powerful healing abilities, he had no time to recover in such a relentless battle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne spat blood again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was sent flying again, spitting blood. His chest had caved in completely. Had it been anyone else, they would have died dozens of times by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Osborne persisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Slowly, he stood up, wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, and sneered at Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cuthbert, did you forget to eat today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that all the strength you've got?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pathetic!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne unleashed a sudden&nbsp;Psychic Blast, and Cuthbert's face turned pale instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Had Cuthbert been at his peak, he might have shrugged it off. But now, exhausted and drained, the psychic attack made his head throb, and he struggled to stay on his feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Panic set in for Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this continued, he feared he might collapse before he could defeat Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn you, I'm going to kill you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The power orb in Cuthbert's chest glowed brightly again, boosting his strength even more, but at the cost of further draining his energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Die already!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne used&nbsp;Stretch Soft Force&nbsp;to absorb most of Cuthbert's attack, but the remaining force still sent him flying. He crashed at the edge of the stage, coughing up blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was inches away from falling off the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could feel that most of his bones were broken, and only sheer willpower kept him going.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as he tried to stand up, Osborne realized after two attempts that he couldn't.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, I'm really this injured, huh?" Osborne muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Osborne unable to stand, the panting Cuthbert laughed joyfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha! In the end, I've won! You're finished now, you damn brat!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Cuthbert began walking step by step toward Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone could see that Cuthbert's steps were unsteady, his energy nearly depleted, and his body at its limit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the orb's glow in his chest had dimmed and faded away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, his steps remained determined, a twisted grin on his face as he approached the fallen Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, the crowd watching fell into silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one had expected the battle between Osborne and Cuthbert to be this brutal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was severely injured!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert had almost exhausted all his strength, his steps unsteady.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, any Godson from the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings could easily defeat Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, Osborne couldn't even stand anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they watched Cuthbert approach Osborne with cold killing intent, Elder Aleena, Stuart, and Vivian grew pale with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Be careful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Surrender now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get off the stage!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three shouted, urging Osborne to leave the stage and surrender to avoid further torment, humiliation, or even death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only Emma smirked coldly at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's won!"</p></div>
