        <h1>Chapter 2658 Entering the Skyfall Casket-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In short, once Ms. Alba finishes her cultivation, we'll enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket. I believe each of us will achieve great advancements."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after a while, they still had doubts. Leroy said, "Is the Skyfall Casket really that powerful? The Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet must have been like us before entering the Celestial Spire, not yet reaching Empyrean Sacredness. Even if they enhanced their strength in the Celestial Spire, they, like us, were only at primary Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did they really reach Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, or even directly achieve Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, just by entering the Skyfall Casket once?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shrugged and said, "That I don't know. After all, this happened nearly a hundred thousand years ago. There might be some exaggeration in this matter, but we can no longer verify the truth. However, the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom does indeed have the notes left by Solomon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The strength of The Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet did indeed improve rapidly in the Skyfall Casket. There's no doubt about that. Frederick's current performance also proves this. The Skyfall Casket not only boosts our cultivation level and strength quickly but also provides a way for warriors like Frederick, who are at Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, to break through their limits and reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In order to survive, he was forced to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket and let Frederick enter it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps Frederick might truly become a warrior at Imperial Empyrean Sacredness because of this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If such a situation truly occurs, Osborne's path to revenge will be very troublesome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I'll first enter the Skyfall Casket to check the situation. I must try to stop Frederick from reaching Imperial Empyrean Sacredness. If I can't, then I'll do my best to enhance my own strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as I am strong enough, even if Frederick reaches Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I can defeat him and then kill him to avenge my mother from my past life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with determination as he thought, "Even if Frederick escapes to the depths of the cosmos, I will never let him go. Even if I have to turn the entire cosmos upside down, I will find him and kill him to avenge my mother."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, why are you so familiar with the situation of the Royal Family?" Adriana's voice sounded at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana had finally finished her training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was now clad in a dazzling, ornate set of Imperial Artifact Armor, every inch of it radiating power and splendor. Only her face was visible beneath the armor&mdash;and she looked breathtaking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Osborne curiously and asked, "Osborne, have you read Solomon's notes? You seem to know a lot about the Royal Family. Why do you have a grudge against the Royal Family?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious. In the end, he still didn't answer and simply said, "Ms. Alba, you might find out soon enough. But for now, let's not waste time. We're already a day behind. Since we're ready, let's head in quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing Osborne didn't want to answer, Adriana gave up asking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She nodded and said, "Then let's set off. Your cultivation level is too low. If you encounter others, you'll be in great danger. So, you must be extremely careful inside. Safety first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright." The others all nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana continued, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, they all rushed toward the crack of the Eighth Skyfall Casket, quickly entering it and disappearing from Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt he had entered into darkness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't see anything, only felt like his body was performing Phantom Steps. He had no control over his own body and couldn't sense anything around him, including Adriana, May, Clara, Leroy, and Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After an unknown amount of time, Osborne suddenly felt a light appear before his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He emerged from the darkness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was standing on a pile of ruins, surrounded by collapsed buildings. Roaring sounds filled his ears, and terrifying forces surged around him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne used Sacred Power to shield his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly took off, flying out of the ruins, and finally saw his surroundings clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne froze.</span></p></div>
