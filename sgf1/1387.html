        <h1>Chapter 1386 Resolved Siblings</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry, what are we going to do now?" Amelia asked worriedly, glancing at Harry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had scared Vance away, she knew that Vance wouldn't just let it go. They grew up in the same village and knew each other all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance was the type to repay grudges. If he felt wronged, he would go out of his way to seek revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he hadn't stood a chance against Harry, but now, with his new position as Patrick's assistant, he had become an overseer of sorts. His leverage over the miners made any attempt at retaliation far too easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry recognized this reality, his expression darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to worry Amelia, so he said, "Don't worry. I'll protect you. I'll make sure that jerk can't hurt you! How dare he even think about marrying you? He's asking for trouble. If he goes after us, I won't hesitate to face him. If it comes to life or death, so be it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing light flashed in his eyes as he spoke, but instead of reassuring Amelia, it only deepened her concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry, please don't act rashly. We're just miners, while Vance is an assistant overseer now. He's registered with the Ninth Dark Deity Legion and could be considered a part of their reserve force. If he takes aim at us, we're in real trouble. If we retaliate, it won't end well. He could easily have the Legion justify coming after us, or worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's words made Harry's face grow more serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a gnawing panic, unsure how to respond effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The change from miner to assistant overseer was just a shift in title, but their relationship with Vance had drastically altered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this cutthroat world of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, even a slight increase in status could mean the difference between life and death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her brother's grim silence, Amelia took the initiative to analyze the situation further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think Vance just became an assistant overseer; he won't risk being too brazen or reckless right away. He's unlikely to make any bold moves against us because that would disrupt the Essence Crystal extraction. Not only would he face questions from the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, but Patrick wouldn't cover for him, either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most he might do is throw a wrench in our plans while we're mining for Essence Crystals, trying to make it difficult for us to gather enough. If we fail to meet the quota in seven days, Patrick will punish us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> our priority is to be on guard against Vance's schemes, and no matter what, we need to ensure we extract enough Essence Crystals in the next seven days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry couldn't help but nod in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right; you're too smart! But submitting triple the usual amount of Essence Crystals in a week is clearly a setup to make things impossible for us. Even if we don't cultivate and use up everything we've saved up, it still won't be enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we'll have to go deeper into the mine!" Amelia said, determination sparking in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry gasped, "Go deeper into the mine?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! It's too dangerous down there! Although the Ninth Dark Deity Legion has cleared out most of the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, many still lurk in the depths, and new ones are born every day. Mining for Essence Crystals down there would risk drawing them in with our life energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget how many miners have lost their lives&mdash;some without a trace&mdash;by venturing too deep in search of Essence Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's face was etched with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's expression grew serious as she spoke, "But apart from delving into the depths of the mine, is there any other way to gather enough Essence Crystals within seven days? The deep mine might harbor </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, but those areas haven't been mined yet, and there are far more Essence Crystals than in the shallows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only by venturing deep into the mine do we stand a chance of excavating enough crystals to weather this storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, Vance has set his sights on us, and he'll be gunning for us relentlessly from here on out. We must grow stronger to protect ourselves. And to grow stronger, we need Essence Crystals. We have to find a way to mine more crystals so that after submitting what's required, we still have enough left to fuel our cultivation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was earnest, determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia continued, "What's a little risk, Harry? Haven't you had enough of this wretched life? Living in mediocrity, slaving away as lowborn miners&mdash;isn't it time we took a leap of faith?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can break through to become Superior Deities, we'll automatically ascend to overseers! Then, we'll have a shot at escaping this hellhole!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's words hit home, and Harry was left stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he was swayed. With a resolute clench of his jaw, he nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, we'll venture into the deep mine! Either we die trying, or we dig up enough Essence Crystals to make a quick breakthrough to Superior Deity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that settled, the siblings prepared to depart.</span></p></div>
