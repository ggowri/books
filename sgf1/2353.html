        <h1>Chapter 2286 Provoke Again-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave'd figured Osborne had blown him off because he'd lined up a stronger crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was just Clara?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave knew the state duel's strength leaderboard like the back of his hand. So, as soon as he heard Clara's name, he instantly knew her ranking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hundred and ninety-ninth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne turned me down to team up with Clara, who's ranked two hundred and ninety-ninth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave rubbed his nose, wearing a look that was a mix of amusement and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave couldn't help but extend another invitation. "Osborne, Clara, how about joining my team after all? If you two team up, you'll have an uphill battle getting a decent result in the state duel. You won't rake in many rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a whole different ballgame if you join my team. We may not be the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me, but we're definitely high-ranked. Not many teams can hold a candle to us in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you think my offer doesn't cut it, we can hash it out. I promise I'll make it worth your while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave was dead serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne still shook his head with a smile. "Gustave, thanks for the offer, but we still can't take you up on it! It's not that your offer isn't good enough. We just prefer to stick together as a duo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave looked disappointed. "Alright! Anyway, it's fate that we've crossed paths. If you run into any trouble in the state duel, just holler. We'll lend a hand if we can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gustave let the topic of teaming up drop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's opinion of Gustave went up a few notches because of his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared with the overbearing arrogance and condescending attitude of Conrad and Malcolm's team, Gustave's tactfulness was a breath of fresh air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was ruminating on Conrad, Malcolm, and the others, he suddenly caught sight of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they spotted Osborne too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Conrad and Malcolm sneered and sauntered over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, look who it is! Isn't this Osborne, ranked 108th on the strength leaderboard and the champion of Tempest Fortress City! Yesterday, he turned down Mr. Maurice's invitation, saying we weren't good enough to team up with him and that he'd give us a taste of our own medicine in the state duel!" Malcolm's sarcastic voice rang out right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People around them were immediately piqued and looked at Osborne in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was Conrad?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a super-powerful heavyweight ranked 15th on the strength leaderboard. Most of those ranked higher than him hailed from top-notch forces like Chilling Nether Palace, Resurgent Throne Palace, and Fiery Volcanic Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad was also one of the heirs of the Maurice family of the Stellary Wolf Clan, a position of great prestige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Conrad has actually invited Osborne to join his team?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But Osborne has turned him down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's more, Osborne has allegedly boasted that Conrad isn't fit to team up with him and that he'd teach Conrad's team a lesson in the state duel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's interest was immediately piqued. Since Malcolm had said it, they didn't question its authenticity and were eager to watch the drama unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned at this turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Yeah, I did reject Conrad's invite, but I never said Conrad wasn't good enough to team up with me. And I sure as hell didn't say I'd teach them a lesson in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Malcolm's just twisting the facts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's his game?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Trying to make me look like an arrogant prick so people'll look down on me, mock me, or even take a swing at me during the state duel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he thought this, Osborne fixed his steely gaze on Malcolm, his eyes glinting with a dangerous edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Malcolm's asking for trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha? Staring daggers at me, huh? What are you gonna do? Throw a punch? Hey, folks, check this out! Osborne's about to take a swing at me!" Malcolm cackled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Malcolm, what the hell are you up to!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone stepped forward and stood in front of Osborne. "Malcolm, the state duel hasn't even kicked off yet. What the heck are you trying to start here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm glanced at the person and frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered and said, "Gustave? What business is this of yours? Did he join your team? Hmph! Ungrateful little... He wouldn't even join Mr. Maurice's team, but he joined your no-good bunch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trash, just like I thought, can only hang out with other trash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were like a sudden bolt of lightning on a clear day, instantly casting a dark, thunderous shadow across Gustave's face. In an instant, Gustave's hands clenched into tight fists.</span></p></div>
