        <h1>Chapter 2394 Not Effective on You-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "This thing is completely useless to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the past, it was called Beast Soul Flower. Its greatest effect was rapidly enhancing the strength of beast-like creatures. Beast Soul Flower is very rare, but it's the best food for beast-like creatures. With enough Beast Soul Flower, their strength can increase infinitely."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For example, the Sacred Dragon Clan and Sacred Tiger Clan are very fond of the Beast Soul Flower."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even innate beast-like creatures like the </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span> are very fond of the Beast Soul Flower, using it to quickly boost their strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For beast-like creatures, the Beast Soul Flower is the best supplement, but for you and me, it's highly poisonous and fatal if consumed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Primordial looked utterly disdainful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Beast Soul Flower?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was also a bit helpless. The Dark Mandala could be exchanged for a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, equivalent to a million Sacred Crystals. He had thought it would be a rare treasure to enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, a million Sacred Crystals are enough to buy a regular low-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turns out, it only works on beast-like creatures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from beast-like creatures, any other race consuming the Beast Soul Flower will undoubtedly die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Looks like it can only be used to exchange for Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne put away the Beast Soul Flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "At least I've confirmed that deeper in the volcanic area, there are indeed Beast Soul Flowers, also known as Dark Mandalas. One Beast Soul Flower can be exchanged for a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. If I find a hundred, that'll be a billion Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The champion of the Zone Duel can only get a hundred million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> as a reward! Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> can ultimately be used to exchange treasures in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury. If I have enough Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, maybe I can retrieve Vivienne's relics from the treasury!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I must get as many </span><span>Beast</span><span> Soul Flowers as possible to exchange for as many Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> as I can. Among Vivienne's relics, there are several invaluable items that require enough Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> to redeem them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne wasted no time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I must keep searching for Beast Soul Flowers!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was not yet the center of the volcanic area. Osborne continued deeper while activating Satan's Eye to quickly scan the surroundings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After another hour, Osborne found the second Beast Soul Flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the first experience, Osborne didn't alarm the Beast Soul Flower this time and easily caught it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Another million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, forty minutes later, Osborne found the third one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half an hour later, Osborne found the fourth one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne discovered that his guess was correct&mdash;the closer to the center of the volcanic region, the easier it was for Beast Soul Flowers to appear. However, the harsh environment there was not a place ordinary people could reach.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne hadn't ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame, he wouldn't have dared to come here. Even with the Sacred Power fused from five forces, it would be hard to withstand the scorching heat, and he would quickly turn into a charred corpse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Perfect, this way no one will disturb me! For the next ten days, I'll search for Beast Soul Flowers at the center of the volcanic region!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had already reached the center of the volcanic region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The volcanoes here were even more massive, each erupting with scorching lava furiously. These were no ordinary volcanoes, and the lava they spewed was far from ordinary as well, with temperatures unimaginably high. Even a low-grade Sacred Artifact would quickly melt if it fell into the lava.</span></p></div>
