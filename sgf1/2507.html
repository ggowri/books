        <h1>Chapter 2408 Blood-Sacrificing Magic-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne couldn&rsquo;t wait tens of thousands of years for it to hatch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Who knows what things will be like in tens of thousands of years? Maybe by then, he&rsquo;ll already be dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, even if the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg hatches, what&rsquo;s the point?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and asked, "Primordial, how confident are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial replied, "I&rsquo;m about fifty percent confident, at most no more than sixty percent."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fifty to sixty percent?" Osborne said seriously, "Then let's begin. It's worth a try. Whether I can hatch it depends on its luck."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said, "Alright, I'll teach you Blood-Sacrificing Magic now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne's mind was filled with some new information.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After quickly grasping the information, Osborne had already mastered Blood-Sacrificing Magic. "So that's how it is."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After simulating it a few times in his mind, Osborne confirmed he had completely mastered Blood-Sacrificing Magic. He looked at the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg and the transparent coffin not far away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need to put this transparent coffin away first to avoid it interfering with my use of Blood-Sacrificing Magic," Osborne thought, then once again stored the transparent coffin into the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, the transparent coffin didn't come out on its own again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and got ready to begin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial said, "You need to be careful. </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragons are incredibly rare. If you miss this one, it will be very hard for us to find another."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "Shut up. Of course, I know to be careful. Your words do nothing but add pressure on me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne ignored Primordial because he could feel that Primordial was also nervous and knew that Primordial said that to help ease his pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was entirely because the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg was just too precious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It&rsquo;s a terrifyingly fierce beast that, once fully grown, can easily tear apart a star or even destroy a Stellar Region. If Osborne could successfully hatch it and raise it as a pet, it would be a tremendous help to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in Osborne's upcoming revenge plan, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon could provide him with immense support.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was nervous, and Osborne was nervous too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after hearing </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> words, Osborne found himself much calmer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then I'll begin." Osborne took out the Warfare Scythe and slashed at his wrist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's body had already reached the mid Sacredness Level, just a step away from advanced Sacredness Level. His skin was incredibly tough, and even an ordinary Sacred Artifact couldn't easily cut through it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the Warfare Scythe was sharp enough. A huge gash appeared on Osborne's wrist, and blood instantly spurted out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the blood didn&rsquo;t fall to the ground; instead, Osborne controlled it like a small stream, directing it all onto the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne lost a significant amount of blood. The 33-feet-tall </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg was completely covered in Osborne's blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Blood-Sacrificing Magic!" Following the Primordial teachings, Osborne instantly performed the Blood-Sacrificing Magic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the blood on the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg seemed to come alive, writhing continuously before quickly merging into the eggshell, causing the entire shell to emit a blood-red glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne was thrilled because if the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg's shell absorbed his blood, it meant the first step of the Blood-Sacrificing Magic had succeeded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second step was to use the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg, which had absorbed his blood, as a sacrifice for the ritual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the ritual, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg would grow faster. If it could hatch before the ritual was completed, Osborne could immediately end the ritual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forcibly ending the ritual would cost him something. However, if the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg could hatch, everything would be worth it to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg still couldn't hatch after the ritual was completed, Osborne would have no choice but to finish the ritual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, Osborne would gain many benefits, but the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg would end up as a dead egg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne nervously stared at the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg, hoping it would successfully hatch.</span></p></div>
