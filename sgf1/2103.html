        <h1>Chapter 2094 Alfreda Was in Trouble</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, Alfreda had sensed the danger herself well before Osborne could warn her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the Phantom Worms launched their attack, a faint energy disturbance brushed against her heightened senses&mdash;so subtle that anyone else might have missed it altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as a Nature Elf, her awareness was finely tuned to even the slightest fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression hardened instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reacting quickly, she attempted to pull back, but the Phantom Worms were too fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Umbra Earth, the powers of everyone, including her own, were heavily suppressed. The dark, purplish soil exerted a powerful pull, making flight nearly impossible and inhibiting their speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could retreat behind the corner, the attack was upon her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fastest of the Phantom Worms barreled toward her like a stampeding calf, crashing violently against her divine power barrier with a resounding crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One after another, several Phantom Worms slammed into Alfreda's defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could hear the cracking sound as her protective barrier shattered under the relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The immense force sent her flying backward, and she crashed into the rocky wall of the chasm, creating a deep dent in the stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood trickled from the corner of Alfreda's mouth as shock gripped her. "What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With wide eyes, she processed the situation. Her divine power barrier had always been near impenetrable&mdash;Alfreda had been confident it could withstand even an average Ascension Six Supernal Deity King's might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here she was, having her defenses shattered by a horde of Phantom Worms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the Elf Armour she wore, which absorbed some of the impact, she would have likely sustained severe injuries, if not worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfreda's crisis was far from over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a wave of pain shoot through her body, pinned helplessly against the hard, purple-black rock, struggling to move. Another Phantom Worm, equivalent to an Ascension Five, charged towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind it, a whole swarm of Phantom Worms was poised to follow suit, all eager to deliver a lethal blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they struck her, even her considerable power wouldn't guarantee her survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alfreda's body lay immobilized, reeling from the violent impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dizziness clouded her mind, rendering her unable to defend or retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the Ascension Five Phantom Worm prepared to slam into her, an invisible arrow materialized out of thin air, racing straight toward her</span><span> direction</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It struck the transparent, plump body of the Phantom Worm with flawless precision&mdash;a spatial arrow launched by Osborne from his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had sensed the unfolding disaster the instant Alfreda was hit. Without hesitation, he pulled back the bowstring, calling upon spatial power to unleash a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow struck true, impacting the Ascension Five Phantom Worm with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Osborne's astonishment, despite his full effort, the arrow didn't pierce the worm completely. Instead, it only broke through the creature's skin, releasing a spray of transparent blood before losing momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the Phantom Worm, it was merely a light wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the sheer force of the arrow altered its trajectory, causing the creature to miss Alfreda entirely. Instead, it collided violently with the purple-black rock beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purple-black rock was instantly gouged out by the impact of the Phantom Worm, shaking the very ground beneath them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a terrifying force! How can the Phantom Worm be this strong? Its physical power rivals that of an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King! No wonder even Alfreda's divine power defense couldn't hold up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne drew back his Bloodwrought Bow again, unleashing a flurry of spatial arrows that struck precisely at the Phantom Worms attempting to charge at Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While his arrows couldn't kill or even seriously wound the Ascension Five Phantom Worms, they were enough to redirect their attacks, ensuring they wouldn't harm Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the Ascension Four Phantom Worms, Osborne's arrows easily pierced through them, leaving them heavily injured in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relentless barrage of arrows formed an impenetrable wall before Alfreda, blocking all incoming attacks from the Phantom Worms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Beverly, Godfrey, and the others stood by, utterly bewildered. They couldn't see the Phantom Worms at all, nor could they sense their energy fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted to help but had no idea where to start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they could see was Osborne's spatial arrows rapidly shooting out and, in front of Alfreda, seemingly hitting something invisible before exploding with a deafening blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really the Phantom Worm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't see it at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't even sense it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are we supposed to deal with this? Why does Osborne seem to be able to see them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly, Godfrey, and the others stared at Osborne, their faces filled with shock and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored their questions, his focus solely on the Phantom Worms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to his support, Alfreda finally regained her composure. Divine power surged around her as she broke free from the grip of the purple-black rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cast a grateful glance at Osborne, her eyes shining with appreciation, but didn't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she glared at the invisible Phantom Worms, her anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to end this!" she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a display of raw power, Alfreda unleashed her fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne's arrows had struggled to penetrate the Ascension Five Phantom Worms, her attacks shattered them effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A torrent of energy erupted from her, and one by one, the Phantom Worms exploded in the void, their dying shrieks echoing in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, over thirty Phantom Worms were obliterated, their presence vanishing from the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the energy around her dissipate, Alfreda furrowed her brow, still on high alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because the immediate threat was gone didn't mean there weren't more lurking nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had sensed nothing before the attack, and the thought of hidden dangers made her uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, all the Phantom Worms around here are dead!" Osborne said, stepping closer to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda finally relaxed, trusting his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, each of Osborne's arrows had struck </span><span>with precision</span><span>, indicating his ability to sense the Phantom Worms with clarity that surpassed her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been the one to alert them about the ambush in the first place, so if he said the coast was clear, she believed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said earnestly, "Osborne, thank you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for you, I would have been in serious trouble! Those damned Phantom Worms had such stealthy energy, and they were so fast. By the time I noticed them, it was almost too late! If you hadn't bought me time, I'd have been done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran down her spine as she recalled the near disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, brushing off her gratitude, "No need to get all formal! Remember, we're a team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not dwell on that. The Phantom Worms are taken care of, so let's hurry and gather the Element Gold Crystals!"</span></p></div>
