        <h1>Chapter 2251 Streak-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all realized Osborne's strength far surpassed theirs by at least two levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't even withstand one of his arrows, and with no hope of victory, why waste their energy? Facing the risk of injury just to fight Osborne seemed pointless when they could save their strength for other matches, where they might still have a chance to break into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the first day of battles drew to a close, Osborne boasted an outstanding record of seven straight wins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right behind him, Jamar and Bethan also remained undefeated, each with six wins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their flawless win rates put them in a temporary three-way tie for first place. It was a safe bet that the eventual champion would come from this elite trio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was plain as day to everyone that Osborne took out his opponents at a far quicker clip than Jamar and Bethan. Both Jamar and Bethan were forces to be reckoned with, but they often had a hard time scoring a one-shot victory. Sometimes, it took them ages to come out on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the day's battles finally wrapped up, the crowd was abuzz with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, Osborne is bound to go head-to-head with Jamar and Bethan! That's when we'll find out who's truly worthy of the champion title!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I reckon it'll be Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he's only at the Ascension Eight level, but he's already got a handle on Sacred Power! Unless Jamar and Bethan have some aces up their sleeves, they don't stand a chance against him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's archery is just mind-blowingly cool and terrifying! So far, only Vadim has managed to take one of his arrows and live to tell the tale! Man, I wish I could be that badass!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd argued and whooped with excitement, they eventually made their way off to catch some rest. The tournament was set to resume bright and early the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the moment arrived. Osborne was up against Jamar!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the arena floor, Osborne tightened his grip on his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow. His expression was as calm as a still lake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In sharp contrast, Jamar looked dead serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're the man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, take down Jamar! You're </span><span>gonna</span><span> be the champion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd below erupted in cheers for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skills and remarkable record had won over many disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect, and they were whole-heartedly rooting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jamar wasn't short on fans either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jamar! Don't let him steal the win! He's only at Ascension Eight! Even if he's mastered Sacred Power, I know you can crush him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Jamar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jamar..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the crowd's cheers didn't faze the two fighters in the arena one bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave Jamar a little wave, the gesture oozing with a teasing challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see what you've got up your sleeve!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar let out a scoff, his voice dead serious. "Osborne, you're something else! At Ascension Eight and already having mastered Sacred Power. Even Vadim couldn't stand up to you&mdash;two arrows and he was out of the game! But taking me down won't be a walk in the park!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had a secret weapon in store for Vadim, but looks like I'll have to unleash it on you instead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better watch your back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arched an eyebrow, a confident smirk dancing on his lips. "A secret weapon, eh? Bring it on! I can't wait to see just how powerful it is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar took a deep breath, his expression growing even more steely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Jamar charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar was well aware of Osborne's deadly archery skills; if he gave Osborne the freedom to shoot at will, he'd end up like Vadim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he decided to go for close-range combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, a bow was a long-range weapon, and its effectiveness would take a nosedive in close-quarters battles. This was his shot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a split second, Jamar closed the gap and launched a ferocious attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunderstrike! Smash through him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar hefted a pair of huge iron hammers, quasi-Sacred Artifacts that practically crackled with raw might. As he swung them, tendrils of lightning snaked across their surfaces, making the ground beneath tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arched an eyebrow, a knowing smile appearing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Close-range combat? You </span><span>wanna</span><span> go toe-to-toe with me in a test of strength? That's an interesting thought, but it's a bit of a pipe dream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't come out on top in a strength showdown!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne balled his right fist, coating it in the searing energy of Sacred Power, and let loose a bone-crushing punch.</span></p></div>
