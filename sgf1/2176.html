        <h1>Chapter 2164 The Aide of Lord Malevolence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum floated through the vastness of deep space, hurtling forward at breakneck speed, leaping through the fabric of reality with each jump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the anguished cries of Osborne echoed, a testament to the pain he was enduring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hurt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The agony was beyond anything he had ever experienced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Primordial was working to fully integrate the massive World Tree fragment into Osborne's bones. The sensation was far more excruciating than having his flesh scraped away piece by piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, to achieve greatness, you must endure immense pain! The more suffering you can withstand now, the stronger you'll become in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In three days, I'll have that World Tree fragment completely merged into your skeleton. But if it gets too much for you, just say the word, and I'll stop the process. You'll still gain some benefits, but it won't be the same," Primordial explained, his voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his jaw, refusing to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the power surging through him as the World Tree fragment melded with his bones, making him stronger and more formidable by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body, already an Infinite Sacred Body, was evolving into something even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time slipped away as the transformation continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on Celestara Planet, the battle raged on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Time, you will pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One erupted from a crater, his face twisted in fury and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been sent flying by God of Time not once, but twice, he couldn't even comprehend how she had done it, let alone defend against her attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stared at God of Time, doubt began to creep in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with tens of billions of Dark Deity Legion warriors watching, he couldn't just back down. The thought of surrendering to God of Time was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One rallied himself for one last push. "Damn it! Dark Sovereigns, attack together!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Time, no matter how powerful you are, it doesn't matter! A thousand years ago, your Sanctum of Time was shattered by the esteemed Lord Malevolence. Without it, how can you hope to defeat us with the Ninefold Heaven's Tower? Even if the tower has lost its lower layers and its power is diminished, it's not something you can handle without your full strength! Ninefold Heaven's Tower, take her down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, Icy One, alongside Icy Two, Icy Three, Icy Four, and Icy Five, unleashed a terrifying wave of energy from the Ninefold Heaven's Tower, directing it straight at the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile appeared on God of Time's face. "How amusing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden distortion in the air around her, the attacks from the Ninefold Heaven's Tower whizzed past her, failing to land a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Sovereigns gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's heart sank as he thought, "I can't evade God of Time's attacks, and I can't even hit her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How are we supposed to win this fight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Am I really going to have to pull back the Dark Deity Legion six million miles and call off what seemed to be a certain victory?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration surged within him, but he felt utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell over the Dark Deity Legion as morale plummeted. In stark contrast, the Human Alliance erupted into jubilant cheers as they witnessed God of Time overpowering Icy One and the other Dark Sovereigns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Time, you're incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With her strength, even Lord Malevolence would have a tough time against her, right? With God of Time on our side, there's hope for the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's counterattack! Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Alliance shouted, their spirits lifted by the sight of their champion standing strong against the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time smiled faintly, raising a hand to silence the chaos around her. She turned her gaze to Icy One, her voice calm yet laced with authority. "Icy One, I don't want to kill anyone today. I'll give you one last chance. If you don't withdraw the Dark Deity Legion six million miles back, I will have no choice but to make it personal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a chilling aura of death radiated from her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's expression shifted to one of grave concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength of God of Time had caught him completely off guard. Even when united with the other four Dark Sovereigns, they stood no chance against her. The Ninefold Heaven's Tower, already weakened from their fight against the God of Light, might not even be able to protect them from her wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thought of retreat began to take root in Icy One's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a cold scoff interrupted the tense moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are Zayne's subordinates really this pathetic? You can't even handle a little girl wielding time power at Ascension Seven? What a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's face paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized the name Zayne Eldridge as that of Lord Malevolence, a title spoken with reverence among the Paramount Supreme Clan. No one dared to call him by his first name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One turned sharply, his expression darkening. "Who dares to speak so boldly? Who's hiding in the shadows? To dare utter the name of the esteemed Lord Malevolence so casually is a death wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a fierce killing intent radiated from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The derisive laughter came. "Ha! What's the big deal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a friend of Zayne, here to lend a hand. So what if I call him by his name? But you, as one of Zayne's subordinates, daring to shout at me? You really think I can't have Zayne take you out with just a word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the voice trailed off, a small figure materialized in front of Icy One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the figure was upon him, gripping his throat with a terrifying strength that made cold sweat pour down Icy One's back. The sensation of impending death washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up. Remember my name&mdash;Tyrese Maxey! I'm from Racial Convergence Planet. If I wanted you dead, you'd already be a goner. But since you're Zayne's underling, I won't kill you&mdash;just get lost while I deal with this little girl!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese's eyes gleamed with excitement as he focused on God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sensed a significant threat emanating from Tyrese's diminutive form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she didn't flinch. "You're from Racial Convergence Planet? Looks like Lord Malevolence is scared. He's worried he can't handle us on his own, so he sent for backup! But do you really think you can kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just at Ascension Seven. If you want to take me out, you're dreaming! Show me just how much stronger you are than Icy One!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the God of Time vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, she reappeared right in front of Tyrese, her fist aimed at his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Tyrese reacted in the nick of time, raising his arm to block the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collision sent shockwaves through the air, both combatants stumbling back, neither able to gain the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in that brief exchange, God of Time's expression darkened considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese, on the other hand, wore a grin. "Your time power doesn't affect me! I've trained in time power too, though it's not as strong as yours. Still, it's enough to block your attacks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In every other aspect, you're no match for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're going to lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tyrese drew forth an enormous battle knife, its blade shimmering with a mesmerizing blue light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an Apex divine artifact, a weapon that rivaled the Ninefold Heaven's Tower!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time's face paled as she realized the implications of what lay before her.</span></p></div>
