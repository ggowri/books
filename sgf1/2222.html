        <h1>Chapter 2202 Hunt-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body went rigid, and he instinctively furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How on earth should he handle the Dark Deity Legion? What about the Paramount Supreme Clan? And what was to be done with all those factions under Lord Malevolence's command?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no ready answers, and truth be told, he didn't feel like dealing with these matters at that very moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the majority of them didn't have the means to flee Celestara Planet. So, he wasn't in a hurry to decide their fates. Moreover, they seemed to have lost their</span><span> ability to</span><span> fight. Despair was clearly written all over their faces. With Lord Malevolence dead, they knew they had been defeated. Any further resistance would only hasten their end, and before long, many of them were laying down their arms and surrendering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what really worried Osborne were the allies that Lord Malevolence had summoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They came from Racial Convergence Planet, specifically a powerful sect called the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Lord Malevolence was being overpowered by Osborne, they sensed the changing situation and made a hasty escape. At that time, Isa, Clarissa, and the others were so preoccupied with Osborne that they didn't even notice these foes slipping away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the battle had ended and their disappearance had been noticed, it suddenly hit him how dire the situation was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we can't let them get away!" Isa pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then cast a glance at the battered Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Lord Malevolence had realized that his Ascending Sacred Sanctum was a Sacred Artifact palace, then Maddox and the others would have too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they managed to flee Celestara Planet and make it back to Racial Convergence Planet, there was no doubt they'd report the matter to the top-brass of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, powerful members of the sect might descend upon Celestara Planet, with the sole intention of seizing his Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that would spell big trouble for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The experts sent by the Mystic Sirius Sect were likely to be even more formidable than Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There could even be Empyrean Sacredness warriors among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a serious expression, Osborne declared, "I'll go after them! As for the Dark Deity Legion, the Paramount Supreme Clan, and the various factions, you all can figure that out. I have one condition</span><span>...</span><span> anyone who has harmed the citizens of the Human Community must be executed! Those who enslaved them will be punished as slaves! As for the rest, I trust you all to handle it well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he waved his hand, and the Ascending Sacred Sanctum floated to his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm coming with you!" Isa insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we're going too!" Clarissa and the others chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated. It had been a long time since he had been separated from the women, and he wanted nothing more than to have them by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew it wasn't the right time. They needed to stay on Celestara Planet, where their presence could deter the Dark Deity Legion and the Paramount Supreme Clan. If anyone dared to resist, their strength was essential for keeping the peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head. "Celestara Planet is still chaotic and needs your leadership! If you come with me, the situation here could spiral out of control!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll be fine. I'll be back before you know it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really doubt my strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hung in the air, and the women fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't afford to waste any more time. Maddox and the other Mystic Sirius Sect members had already been gone for a while, and if he delayed, even with the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, he might not catch up.</span></p></div>
