        <h1>Chapter 2476 The Enemy Also Fears-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is currently in a dilemma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On one side is the legendary Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, where only Imperial Empyrean Sacredness Warriors can barely survive&mdash;a mysterious route leading straight into the depths of the universe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side is a rapidly approaching Warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Choosing to enter the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign almost guarantees death, but if he refuses to step in, he will be caught by the Warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. He is no match for him. Moreover, over ten other Warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and Great Perfection are following closely behind, leaving no chance of survival either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne has never been an indecisive person, but at this moment, he doesn't know what to choose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a sword light tore through the void, accompanied by a tall figure emerging from the void, appearing not far from Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he saw Osborne, a cold smile appeared on his face. "I finally caught up with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying this, he immediately prepared to strike, attempting to quickly deal with Osborne and seize his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to avoid interference from those chasing behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as he made his move, his expression suddenly changed, and he swiftly looked behind Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He exclaimed, "Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he quickly retreated, as if terrified of being devoured by this terrifying presence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, a glimmer of hope flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So it's not just me who fears this Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, even the one hunting me is more terrified and frightened! After all, he is merely at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, not an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness Warrior, and has no chance of surviving in the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, I possess spatial power and time powers, which might give me a sliver of hope in the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, whereas once he enters, he is doomed to certain death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne suddenly felt much more at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at the man and calmly said, "Who are you? Hunting me so openly and stealing my Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, aren't you afraid of being ridiculed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man sneered after hearing this, "Ridiculed? Who would laugh at me? If I succeed, others will only envy and be jealous of me. That's over 46 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints! Enough for me to exchange for four, maybe even five supreme Sacred Artifacts from the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And I, Lionel Lawson, have been cultivating for tens of thousands of years, stuck at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection cultivation level for a full ten thousand years. I've traveled through several Stellar Regions, set foot on countless resource-bearing planets, ventured into numerous perilous secret lands, and tried everything, yet all I've obtained is this one supreme Sacred Artifact in my hand."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Lionel glanced down at the longsword in his hand and continued, "And now, as long as I kill you, I can obtain 46 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. I won't miss such a great opportunity. As for whether I'll be ridiculed, those who don't dare to make a move against you are the real joke!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he glanced once more at the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a Warrior at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection level, he was well aware of the terrifying nature of this path. With his strength, entering it would undoubtedly mean certain death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, he had always dared not approach the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p></div>
