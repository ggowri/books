        <h1>Chapter 479 Hummingbird Gang</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Hummingbird Gang? I have never heard of it!" Osborne said coldly, his expression unchanged. He knew that the Hummingbird Gang must be an underground gang in </span><span>Pinchide</span><span> City. They dared to act so recklessly on a commercial street, which meant their strength was certainly not simple. Moreover, there must be a powerful force backing them from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps was it some wealthy family, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with Osborne's current status, he had long ceased to pay attention to such underground gangs. Even aristocratic families had no connection to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the top wealthy families wanted to curry favor with him, they would have no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was only concerned with the ancient families in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no interest in knowing how many underground gangs like the Hummingbird Gang existed in </span><span>Pinchide</span><span> City. As long as they didn't provoke him, they would never have any interaction with him because the difference in their levels was too vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the young man heard Osborne's indifferent tone, anger suddenly appeared on his face. He felt as if he was being looked down upon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man said, "You haven't heard of the Hummingbird Gang, right? Well, starting from today, you will remember us! The Hummingbird Gang will forever be your nightmare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he punched Osborne in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They dared to act so boldly in broad daylight. It had to be said that the Hummingbird Gang was indeed audacious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly and did not display his power. After all, there were ordinary people around him. The young man in front of him was just a little sturdy and not worth him showing off his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reached out his hand and grasped the young man's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for the young man to react, he exerted a little force with his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man let out a scream of agony as his arm began to distort and contort. The intense pain made his body tremble, and beads of sweat the size of beans quickly fell from his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man kicked towards Osborne but was preemptively kicked in the knee by him. Immediately, a crisp sound of bone breaking echoed as his knee shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and threw the young man to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around were all shocked as they saw Osborne actually taking action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young man, run away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone yelled out in concern, "They're members of the Hummingbird Gang, the largest underground gang in </span><span>Pinchide</span><span> City. They're involved in drug trafficking, smuggling, and human trafficking. They capture orphans everywhere and force them to earn money for the gang. If they fail to complete their tasks, they are beaten, abused and denied food. They're truly ruthless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Osborne raised his eyebrows and said, "Isn't there anyone who can take care of these things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who dares to intervene?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person speaking in the crowd was an elderly man. He appeared indignant and quickly said, "The Hummingbird Gang has thousands of members, and they all carry guns. Who dares to intervene in such matters as ordinary people? Anyone who provokes them is beaten to death and thrown into the sea to be fish food! Even the Enforcement Team doesn't dare to interfere with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Behind the Hummingbird Gang, there is a powerful backer! It is said to be the top wealthy Pluto family. Even the Pluto family is not their biggest backer. Behind the Pluto family is the ancient Luther family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without the backing of the Pluto family or even the Luther family, how dare they act so recklessly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's all I can tell you. Run away! Otherwise, you won't have a chance. You're still young, and there's no need to throw your life away here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing speaking, the elderly man quickly slipped into the crowd and escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was extremely indignant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The backer behind the Hummingbird Gang was the top wealthy Pluto family? Or even the Luther family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a flash of murderous intent in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man lying on the ground said, "Guy, you're done for! How dare you hit me? You're completely done for! Do you realize the strength of the Hummingbird Gang now? Are you scared?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize to me, then let your girlfriend sleep with me, and maybe you can die without so much pain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a ferocious expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne immediately stepped on his other foot, breaking his second leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man let out a shrill scream, and his broken bones protruded from his flesh, blood splattering everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watching </span><span>were</span><span> all terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he suddenly grasped the pistol at his waist and was about to shoot at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled the trigger with a ferocious look. Osborne had countless ways to prevent him from firing the gun, but he chose not to do so and allowed the young man to shoot at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just pulled Clarissa, took a few steps back, and avoided all the bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man quickly emptied the magazine but was stunned to find Osborne standing there unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sound of the gunshot rang out, the onlookers screamed in fear and fled in all directions. Some hid in nearby shops, peering out to catch a glimpse of the commotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several members of the Hummingbird Gang swiftly approached, with one of them pulling the hair of the young girl, causing her immense pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at their companion lying on the ground, their faces suddenly became extremely gloomy, and they all looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard, you're looking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying that, several people pulled out their pistols and aimed at Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted coldly and took out a pistol from the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not an energy pistol, but a Draco Model H mini-handgun that he had not used for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I will rid the people of this evil!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a gunfight broke out.</span></p></div>
