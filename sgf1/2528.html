        <h1>Chapter 2429 Five Hundred Thousand Ice Beetles</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the time, Ice Beetles remain dormant deep within the glacier. Meanwhile, their power is almost entirely concealed, and their body structure is nearly identical to the surrounding glacier, making it nearly impossible for Osborne's Satan's Eye to easily locate them in this endless expanse of ice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He searched for so long that he started feeling a bit dizzy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Ice Beetles are living creatures, so they must come out to move and hunt. Even at the lowest frequency, they wake up twice a year to hunt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought Time Retrace might help him spot the hunting Ice Beetles, allowing him to follow them and locate their dormant nests.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In theory, this is feasible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had already tried. With his current ability, he could trace back events from up to a year ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for events from over a year ago, he couldn't trace them back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that was already enough. Osborne only needed to spot any Ice Beetle in the traced scenes, and he could follow their movement path to locate their dormant nests.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately gave it a try.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Ice Beetles don't hunt far. They only search repeatedly within 6000 miles of their nests! I just need to divide this glacier area into countless 6000-mile zones, then use Time Retrace in each zone. If I spot any Ice Beetles, it means their nest is nearby!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not, it means there are no Ice Beetles nearby. This way, I won't have to use my Satan's Eye to search inch by inch!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately activated his time powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through Time Retrace, countless scenes from the past year in this area flashed before his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, those scenes disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne discovered that no Ice Beetles had appeared in this area over the past year.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This indicates there are no nests nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, let's head to the next area!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon receiving the command, Flash immediately flapped its three pairs of wings, crossing 6,000 miles at incredible speed before stopping in the next area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately used Time Retrace again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quickly, the scene flashed by, but he still didn't find any Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, they are not within this 6,000-mile area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instructed Flash to move on to the next area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like that, Osborne used Time Retrace again and again, searching for Ice Beetles! In fact, every time he used Time Retrace, it consumed a lot of his soul power. If it were someone else, using Time Retrace once or twice would probably require a long rest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, their soul power simply couldn't withstand such consumption.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne has the Chaotic Spiritual Root.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if his soul power is depleted, as long as the Chaotic Spiritual Root absorbs casually in the void, he can recover quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne can almost use Time Retrace at will.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What surprised him even more was that during the process of repeatedly using Time Retrace and consuming his soul power, his soul power was actually growing slowly, becoming stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Does this count as an alternative form of cultivation?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled. He didn't expect using Time Retrace could enhance his soul power. Instantly, he felt even more motivated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, on his twelfth use of Time Retrace, he saw a group of hunting Ice Beetles in the scene.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instantly became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There&rsquo;s an Ice Beetles' nest nearby! Flash, take a look around while I pinpoint their nest's location!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quickly, with the teamwork of Osborne and Flash, they found the Ice Beetles' nest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's hidden very deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with Osborne's Satan's Eye, it could easily be missed, but now he had it completely locked in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, he used Time Retrace to search such a large area in a very short time. If he had used his Satan's Eye to search bit by bit, it would have taken him at least ten times longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, Osborne's speed in finding the Ice Beetles increased tenfold!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And as long as he found them, everything else became simple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just handed it over to Flash!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne fed Flash a Beast Soul Flower. Flash immediately got to work enthusiastically. Its blue Dragon's Breath might not match the power of Brenda's Ice Scepter, but it was more enduring and flexible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Flash wiped out all the Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A total of thirty thousand!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne used the ocular energy of Satan's Eye to envelop the corpses of the Ice Beetles and stored them in Satan Space. Then, without wasting any time, he continued searching for the next group of Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still used Time Retrace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's hunting speed had reached a terrifying level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, a day passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Osborne had the Chaotic Spiritual Root and didn't need to worry about the consumption of his soul power, he decided to take a break for now and sort through and allocate today's gains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an ice valley, he, Leroy, and Clara sat around a fire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara's eyes revealed surprise and anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, have you sorted it out?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Yes, I've sorted it out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he took out two Dimensional Bags.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each Dimensional Bag contains the corpses of 100,000 Ice Beetles! These are your spoils of the day. You each get 20%!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara took the Dimensional Bags, and then they were stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each of us gets 20%, which means 100,000 each! Does that mean we hunted 500,000 Ice Beetles in just one day?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"100,000 Ice Beetles can be exchanged for 200 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints! Oh my god! That's 200 million... We worked hard for two days and only got over 80 million. But today alone, we got 200 million?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And besides, before we worked so hard to handle the corpses, but today we just sat on horseback strolling around, doing nothing..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara both felt incredulous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These spoils came so easily that they found it a bit unbelievable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We already agreed on the distribution plan, so don't change it! Besides, each of you gets 100,000, which means I get 300,000 alone! My share is bigger..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed, "More importantly, we wasted a lot of time today. I'm still not skilled enough with Time Retrace! Tomorrow, we'll gain even more."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even he felt a bit happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Ice Beetles can eventually be exchanged for Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, which can then be used to redeem treasures in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's vault.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Glorious Divine Kingdom's vault has so many treasures. This time, I must get some!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was quite excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, it was already the fifth day of the zone duel. Normally, there were still five days left before it would end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne wasn't sure if it would end early.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, with the appearance of the Magma Devourer, this year's zone duel was already in chaos! Perhaps, once the Glorious Divine Kingdom's reinforcements arrived and dealt with the Magma Devourer, the zone duel would end early.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way! We can't waste any more time..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stood up and patted Flash's head. "Mount up. We're going to keep hunting Ice Beetles!"</span></p></div>
