        <h1>Chapter 2447 Magma Devourer is dead</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long ago, Osborne consumed nearly a hundred drops of Elven Sacred Water and entered the Enlightenment State nearly a hundred times. By comprehending the world and himself, he finally created his own Divine Ascendance Technique, namely the Solar Sacred Arrow and Warfare Blade Technique.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was using the strongest move in the Warfare Blade Technique, Heaven-Cleaving Slash!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To unleash the full power of this move, he needed an unshakable determination, a fearless aura, and the confidence that this slash could cleave the entire cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne certainly couldn't achieve such a level yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he was already trying. In his eyes, at this moment, the Magma Devourer was just a massive rock that he could easily cleave apart!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Scythe was glowing and flickering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly vanished from his original spot. Using spatial power, he appeared thousands of yards away from the Magma Devourer in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't that he didn't want to get closer, but the energy fluctuations around it were too intense. With his current strength, he couldn't even tear open a dimensional rift for interdimensional travel within thousands of yards around it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this distance was perfect because the Heaven-Cleaving Slash needed some space to charge and build momentum for greater power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, for Osborne, a distance of several thousand yards was just a blink away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he gripped the Warfare Scythe tightly with both hands, pouring his remaining strength into it. In an instant, he crossed the distance of several thousand yards and appeared in front of the Magma Devourer, almost pressed against its massive body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, it had just blasted Flash away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that instant, it seemed to sense danger and suddenly turned to look at Osborne. Immediately, it saw the tiny, ant-like Osborne swinging an almost miniature scythe fiercely toward its chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Magma Devourer suddenly felt unease and fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, with its intelligence, it couldn't possibly associate these feelings with Osborne at its chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It even </span><span>thought</span><span> its unease came from Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, it made no move to dodge Osborne's strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heaven-Cleaving Slash!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Die!" Osborne roared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All his power erupted instantly. The Warfare Scythe slashed fiercely at the chest of the Magma Devourer with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud bang, a bright light suddenly flashed. Everyone present felt darkness descend, as if all light had vanished, leaving only a brilliant blade's glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blade's glow, along with all its energy, split the volcanic ash in the sky, shattered the volcanoes, and carved terrifying cracks across the entire world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, it carved a horrifying yet tiny wound on the chest of the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the Warfare Scythe was too sharp, the wound it inflicted on the massive Magma Devourer was almost invisible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, that tiny wound began to split open, growing larger and larger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood, like molten lava, gushed from the wound, at first flowing like a small stream, gradually turning into a river, then a mighty torrent...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gurgling sound kept echoing!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Magma Devourer's wound finally gave way, suddenly turning into a massive chasm-like crack, hundreds of yards deep, almost splitting its chest open.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The silicon-based neural nodes several dozen yards deep had already been destroyed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Osborne was startled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected that the Heaven-Cleaving Slash, combined with the sharp Warfare Scythe, could cause such a terrifying effect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A wound hundreds of yards deep?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This almost split the Magma Devourer's chest open?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is too exaggerated!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne was stunned, forgot to dodge, and was drenched in the scorching blood of the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when Flash gave it his all, using his claws and teeth to wound the Magma Devourer, the injuries were no more than 33 feet deep. For the Magma Devourer, they healed quickly and were far from fatal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Gerald, who had reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, leveraging the glacial region to suppress the Magma Devourer's power, only inflicted wounds about one or two hundred yards deep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But since its silicon-based neural nodes were unharmed, it remained fine, able to resist and escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the wound Osborne just inflicted on the Magma Devourer was like carving a massive canyon into its body, at least 500 yards deep!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, this wound is not fatal to it either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, its body is enormous, towering tens of thousands of yards high.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A 500-yard wound for the Magma Devourer is like leaving a 0.4-inch wound on an average adult. While it would hurt and bleed continuously, it wouldn't be fatal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne successfully shattered several of the Magma Devourer's most critical silicon-based neural nodes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, it stopped moving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its enormous eyes revealed confusion, then fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer struggled to turn its head, looking at its chest. Then, it saw the massive wound and the tiny Osborne still holding the Warfare Scythe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With its intelligence, it simply couldn't understand how Osborne, someone so tiny in its eyes with such a weak presence, could instantly inflict such a terrifying wound on its sturdy body, and how he could so precisely shatter its silicon-based neural nodes!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer couldn't find an answer and had no chance to think further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those silicon-based neural nodes were key to connecting the Energy Vortexes within its body. After they were destroyed, it could no longer control its body's power. The head-turning motion just now had already drained all its strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, its body began to collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sturdy shell could no longer cling to its body, falling off piece by piece.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, its massive body collapsed like a crumbling mountain, crashing down with a thunderous roar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rumbling thunderous noise kept echoing!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Countless streams of blood, like magma, flowed out from Magma Devourer's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had just been wreaking havoc, able to overpower Flash, but now its life and the Energy Vortex within its body were rapidly fading away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, it died!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finally came to his senses, staring in disbelief at the fallen Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It&rsquo;s dead?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Did I really succeed?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer, even Mr. Norton, who reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, and Flash couldn&rsquo;t defeat it, and I killed it with just one strike?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne looked dazed, staring at the Warfare Scythe in his hand, gazing at its sharp blade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I underestimated the sharpness of the Warfare Scythe!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, it's time to reap the rewards!"</span></p></div>
