        <h1>Chapter 2219 Interrogate</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Shelvin and Vince dealt with, the remaining Phantom Tide Demon Sect warriors were merely small fry, posing no real threat to Osborne and Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly dispatched the rest of the warriors, knocking them unconscious instead of killing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if these warriors died, the Phantom Tide Demon Sect would undoubtedly figure out something was amiss and send reinforcements to investigate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne wasn't particularly afraid, it could complicate matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still needed to uncover whether his parents had been sold into slavery over twenty years ago, and a full-blown confrontation with the Phantom Tide Demon Sect wasn't ideal just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the enemies lay defeated, Osborne thought for a moment before waving his hand, drawing all the metal boxes into Hope Haven. The unconscious Phantom Tide Demon Sect warriors followed suit, temporarily imprisoned within the safe confines of his sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the spacious cavern, only the unconscious forms of Shelvin and Vince remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa urged, glancing around anxiously, "Osborne, we need to hurry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Phantom Tide Demon Sect is in the middle of a slave transaction. If the buyers don't receive their shipment, they'll definitely reach out to the Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before long, they'll realize something's gone wrong here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne agreed, nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He summoned a wave of energy and infused it into Vince's body. Vince stirred awake, groaning in pain, his face contorted in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa didn't hold back at all. He was in a pretty bad way, badly beaten up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne barked, "Cut the blubbering! I've got a few questions for you, and you'd better spill the beans. Otherwise, I'll waste no time snuffing you out right here and rummaging through your memories!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Vince started shaking like a leaf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes darted back and forth between Osborne and Isa. When he saw two unfamiliar middle-aged folks glaring at him, his face turned as white as a sheet. "Who the hell are you? Why are you coming after the Phantom Tide Demon Sect? You'd better let me go, or my old man will come after you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how tough you think you are, you won't make it off Necoton Planet alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still a spark of defiance in his eyes, but all Osborne did was let out a cold laugh, a cruel grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly lashed out with a swift kick to Vince's face. "Looks like you still don't get the picture! After all that's happened, you still have the nerve to threaten me? If you're just itching to kick the bucket, I'll be more than glad to help..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a wave of deadly intent oozed from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince felt a cold shiver run down his spine. "Wait! Don't kill me! I'll talk! Just fire away with your questions, and I swear I'll tell you the whole truth! Please, just don't kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince quickly did a 180, the fear clear as day in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a sly smirk. His earlier threats had just been a ploy to rattle Vince. He wasn't about to off Vince just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're the one running the Phantom Tide Demon Sect's slave-trading racket?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince hesitated when he heard the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes went wide as he could feel Osborne getting antsy. All of a sudden, he blurted out, "Yeah! It's me! But we didn't have a say in it. Some bigwig from Racial Convergence Planet came to us and told us to handle the slave trade. We couldn't say no!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We got strong-armed into it! We didn't want any part of this slave-trading mess; it was all that big shot's doing! He scoops up ninety percent of the profits, and we're left with the crumbs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, clearly interested. "Who's this bigwig from Racial Convergence Planet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince shook his head frantically. "I don't know! I really don't! The only person in the entire Phantom Tide Demon Sect who knows who that big shot is... is my father! All I know is that he's incredibly powerful&mdash;an Empyrean Sacredness warrior! He's backed by a massive force that we, the Phantom Tide Demon Sect, can't even begin to contend with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have no choice but to obey. If you want to find out who this big shot is, you'll have to talk to my father! I can take you to him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold laugh. "Take us to him? You think I'd let your father come after us? Don't worry, if it comes to that, I'll pay him a visit myself. But that's not urgent right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did you start handling the slave trade for the Phantom Tide Demon Sect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty years ago!" Vince replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up at this revelation. If Vince had been in charge of the slave trade for thirty years, it meant he was already overseeing operations when Osborne's parents were sold as slaves by the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his parents had indeed ended up with the Phantom Tide Demon Sect, Vince might have been the one handling the transaction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath quickened. "How many batches of slaves have you received from Celestara Planet during those years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince paused, confusion crossing his face. "Slaves from Celestara Planet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, clearly trying to recall. Finally, he said, "There were two batches in total! Yes, I remember clearly! The Paramount Supreme Clan from Celestara Planet is quite timid! They agreed to the slave trade but were too scared to capture slaves recklessly for us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In thirty years, they only sent us two batches of slaves, both of which I personally oversaw! The first batch was twenty years ago&mdash;about a million of them, but the quality was low, many were below Celestial Deity Level! The second batch came ten years ago; it was a bit larger, around three million, but the quality was even worse, barely worth anything! Perhaps that's why they never sent us any more slaves after that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Vince spoke, Osborne's eyes gleamed with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me more about that first batch from Celestara Planet twenty years ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince hesitated, cautiously asking, "What exactly do you want to know? That batch had over a million slaves, all from the Human Community... I only glanced at them. I don't know much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment before pulling out two images.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were pictures of his father, Theodore, and his mother, Vivienne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you seen these two people?" he asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince stared at the images for a long time before shaking his head, a bitter expression on his face. "I don't remember! With over a million slaves, they all looked like beggars. Even if I had seen them... I wouldn't be able to recall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Isa whispered to him, "Osborne! You don't need to ask so much! Since we've established that the Paramount Supreme Clan did indeed sell a million Human Community slaves to the Phantom Tide Demon Sect twenty years ago, your parents must be among them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All you need to do is find out where that batch of slaves ended up! If you're still not satisfied, you can always kill him afterward and search his memories!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There might be clues about your parents in there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up at her suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned back to Vince, his tone sharp. "Tell me, where did that batch of slaves from Celestara Planet end up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better be honest with me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I find out you're lying, I guarantee you'll wish you hadn't been born!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint shot across Osborne's eyes, and Vince could practically taste the danger in the air.</span></p></div>
