        <h1>Chapter 1700 Battle With Chandler</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler, the Vice Commander of the Inferno Army and a warrior of the Fire Tiger Clan, possessed the power of flames that could reduce almost anything to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite the overwhelming fire power at his disposal, Angelo, also a Deity King warrior, was not so easily defeated. With a surge of determination, Angelo unleashed a mind-control barrier, forcing Chandler's flames to swirl around him instead of consuming him entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler furrowed his brow, confusion flitting across his features as he glanced at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a second. How is it that a lowly Human Community member like you, standing </span><span>at the Deity Overlord level, isn't turned to ash in my flames? You're not even heavily injured!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprising even himself, Chandler felt genuine astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames raged around Osborne, scorching him relentlessly. While his divine power defenses had collapsed, his Divine Body showed remarkable resilience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the flames could indeed injure Osborne, they did not pose a serious threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a spectacle astonished not only Chandler but also Arnold and Mariah, who were close by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for them, enduring such damage seemed a far-fetched feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy's up to something!" Chandler growled, his patience wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intensified the flames, forcing Osborne's wounds to worsen, though they still lacked the severity of the true injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought to himself with a smirk, "Chandler really is an impressive warrior, nearing the mid-stage of Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength far exceeds Angelo's. It's true that Angelo can't hurt me, but Chandler has easily breached my divine defenses and injured my Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity restoring my strength, I'd be fleeing from him rather than fighting.</span><span> </span><span>But now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the fiery inferno crackling around him, Osborne focused on the tense expression on Chandler's face, his confidence bolstered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can take him on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drawing upon the Lotus' power, Osborne began to heal rapidly</span><span> and</span><span> his injuries mend</span><span>ed</span><span> before Chandler's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unexpected recovery left Chandler stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! How is this even possible?" he exclaimed, disbelief etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With measured steps, Osborne emerged from the flames, his demeanor calm. "There's nothing impossible here! I warned you that if you didn't submit willingly, I'd have to crush you! Angelo, keep those two busy while I handle Chandler!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, eight Spatial Clones materialized around him</span><span> and formed</span><span> a crescent of power and intensity that encircled Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meanwhile, Angelo, hearing Osborne's command, charged at Arnold and Mariah with reckless abandon</span><span> and </span><span>launch</span><span>ed</span><span> himself into a frenzied attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angelo, you're asking for death!" Arnold and Mariah shouted in anger, refusing to hold back as they engaged Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their combined might, they matched Angelo strike for strike. Despite his skills, he found himself outnumbered, soon sporting a few injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that didn't deter him. Having been transformed into a member of the Blood Clan and strengthened by the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, Angelo absorbed its healing properties, giving him an edge</span><span>, </span><span>almost an unkillable nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wounds he sustained were trivial compared to the recovery he could achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, undaunted by their attacks, he kept the two warriors occupied, refusing to let them break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, the battle between Osborne and Chandler intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's prowess truly dwarfed that of Angelo, and Osborne found that his high-tier techniques, like the Eclipse of Eternity, were quickly brushed aside by Chandler's force. Even when he resorted to using the Abyssal Spear, he could only manage to inflict minor wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Osborne had his eight Spatial Clones beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their offensive capabilities, while not quite the same as his own, were formidable, especially when combined with a devastating Space Collapse that threatened Chandler considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flames roared around Chandler, a chaotic inferno that erupted with wild intensity, yet Chandler found himself unable to gain the upper hand against Osborne and his Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook violently beneath them, shattered by the ferocity of their battle, and Osborne reveled in the thrill of combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is exhilarating!" he exclaimed</span><span>. A</span><span> grin spread across his face</span><span> and</span><span> excitement cours</span><span>ed</span><span> through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the thrill was short-lived. Reality set in as Osborne quickly regained his composure. Despite Chandler's struggles, Osborne was still at a disadvantage. His own power was limited; he was only at the early stage of the Deity Overlord realm, barely scratching the surface of what it meant to be a Quasi-Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing someone like Chandler, who was nearing the mid-stage of Deity King, Osborne knew his current abilities wouldn't be enough to secure victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't afford to waste any more time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fight is bound to attract attention from the Divine Peak Nine base nearby. If I don't wrap this up soon, I'll have a horde of people on my back," Osborne thought</span><span>. U</span><span>rgency </span><span>was </span><span>ignit</span><span>ed</span><span> within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined focus, he summoned his inner strength</span><span> and felt </span><span>a surge of power swell around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His energy exploded outward as he ascended rapidly through the ranks, from the mid-stage of Deity Overlord to the late stage and finally reaching the pinnacle of Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To expedite his rise, Osborne tapped into the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, drawing a small fraction of strength from the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even just a taste of that power propelled him to the peak of the Deity Overlord realm, a transformation that filled him with renewed vigor.</span></p></div>
