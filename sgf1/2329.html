        <h1>Chapter 2273 Unrivaled King of the City Duel-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the arena fell into an eerie silence. After Osborne took the full brunt of Leroy's Inferno Drake Lance and knocked her unconscious, everyone was left in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it didn't take long for the crowd to erupt into a cacophony of chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy's gone down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm floored! She wielded the Sacred Artifact, the Inferno Drake Lance, and still came up short! And it seems Osborne swooped in to save her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy just couldn't rein in the might of that Sacred Artifact. In the end, it addled her brain and sent her off the deep end. If Osborne hadn't stepped in sharpish and knocked her out cold, she'd have been in for some serious blowback and long-term damage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's the victor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the champ!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the crowd from the Mystic Sirius Sect erupted into thunderous cheers. Osborne's win meant he was now the unrivaled king of the city duel, with a spotless record.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a century since a disciple from the Mystic Sirius Sect had even cracked the top three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, not only had they made it onto the podium, but they'd snagged the championship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lots of the senior disciples from the Mystic Sirius Sect couldn't help but shed tears of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the bigwigs from Azure Haven Academy finally jumped into action. They dashed onto the stage to check on Leroy's condition. A wave of relief washed over them as they heaved sighs of relief in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The blowback wasn't too bad. A bit of medicine and a couple of weeks' rest, and she'll be back on track! It won't crimp her potential or dampen her talent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a relief!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, they turned their mixed-emotion gazes towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A maelstrom of feelings swirled within them&mdash;anger, frustration, but also gratitude. They knew that Osborne's timely move had saved Leroy from serious harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he'd hesitated for even a split second longer, Leroy would have been toast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Azure Haven Academy, Leroy was a once-in-a-blue-moon talent. If her gifts got derailed, it would be a colossal loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they were thankful to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the thought of Osborne walking away with the championship&mdash;and the hefty price tag of over two million Sacred Crystals&mdash;made their hearts ache. They felt as if they had taken a massive hit in this city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even wished they could wipe that smug smile off Osborne's face with a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, two million Sacred Crystals could buy several Sacred Artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Angela appeared by Osborne's side, her concern evident as she looked him over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single sight was like a cold splash of water, dousing any underhanded schemes brewing in the minds of Azure Haven Academy's higher-ups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were no strangers to Angela's true standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a disciple on a training stint from the mighty Fairy Moon Sect, she was off-limits, a force not to be trifled with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you alright?" Angela asked, her brow furrowed in worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Osborne to take the full force of Leroy's Inferno Drake Lance. Seeing the Eclipse War Armor shatter and the moment the Sacred Artifact struck him, she nearly stopped breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a Sacred Artifact, for crying out loud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its power was off the charts, and even she wouldn't dream of going toe-to-toe with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, spitting out a bit of blood and that was it? Seemed like he was none the worse for wear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is he suffering from internal injuries?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela fretted, a knot of worry forming in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot her a serene smile. "Thanks for caring, Ms. Olsen, but I'm good! Looks like I've bagged the championship, right? I recall you said you'd give me a surprise if I won.</span></p></div>
