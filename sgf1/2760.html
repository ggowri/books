        <h1>Chapter 2622 Celestial Spire-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, only sixty people could still stand in front of the massive door of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three days ago, there were a total of 109 participants in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other forty-nine had died in the earlier Spirit-Entombing Fragrance attack, including three princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were once nine princes and princesses, but now only six remain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone looked dissatisfied, and even the faces of Seraphina and the other six princes and princesses were extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, they also didn&rsquo;t know Necropolis City was this dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, stop wasting time. We'd better hurry into the Celestial Spire. Emperor Frederick mentioned that it's safer inside the Celestial Spire than outside for us," someone said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many immediately agreed, as they were still enduring the Soul Attack. They feared that if they didn&rsquo;t enter the Celestial Spire soon, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to withstand it and would end up among the dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're right. Let's hurry inside!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Things are already like this, and saying anything else is useless. We have no way out now. If we don&rsquo;t get the Skyfall Casket key from the Celestial Spire, Emperor Frederick won&rsquo;t let us leave. All of us will die here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, only by quickly entering the Celestial Spire, passing its trials, and obtaining the Skyfall Casket key can we make it out alive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What this person said was agreed upon by everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina said, "I'm glad everyone has a clear understanding. You're absolutely right. If we don't pass the eighteenth trial of the Celestial Spire and obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, we won't leave Necropolis City alive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I&rsquo;m no exception either. We either get the key to the Skyfall Casket, or die in Necropolis City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she glanced at everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, we need to work well together from now on. Only by combining everyone's strength can we better pass the trials and get the key!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this situation, we must appoint a leader, someone who can unite us and lead us through the trials."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think that person should be me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because I know Celestial Spire best, and I'm the strongest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a proud expression appeared on Seraphina's face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as soon as she finished speaking, Leroy sneered, "What makes you think you can be the leader to guide us? Are you really the strongest? How can you say that? If I remember correctly, you were only fifth place in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are also three joint champions here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Leroy looked at Osborne and added, "If you have to choose a leader, I think Osborne is the most suitable because he is the strongest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished speaking, many people immediately began to agree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right. Osborne is the champion! Osborne defeated you head-on in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. What makes you claim you're the strongest?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right. Osborne is the champion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's face darkened upon hearing this. She shouted sternly, "Fool!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glanced around at everyone and said calmly, "On this Celestial Spire, there is a powerful Cultivation Shackle, and only those who haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness can enter it. Once we enter the Celestial Spire, the Cultivation Shackle will no longer affect us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, we can break through to a new cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once I break through to a new cultivation level, I can immediately reach mid Empyrean Sacredness. In that case, do you think Osborne's strength will surpass mine?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina looked disdainful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was shocked upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After entering the Celestial Spire, we can break through to a new cultivation level? Once you break through, you can reach mid Empyrean Sacredness? How is that possible? How can you do that?"</span></p></div>
