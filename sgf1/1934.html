        <h1>Chapter 1933 Infinite Sacred Body</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of excruciating pain coursed through Osborne's nerves, tormenting him relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt as if every single cell in his body was cracking apart, shattering, only to rapidly regenerate and grow stronger, each one brimming with terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This agonizing transformation lasted a full ten minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the storm finally subsided, Osborne realized his Divine Body had undergone a complete metamorphosis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no longer just a Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had evolved into something far greater&mdash;an Infinite Sacred Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt light as a feather, his skin and flesh incredibly resilient, infused with an unimaginable strength. A casual wave of his hand sent ripples through space, creating tiny cracks that left him utterly astonished. "My power..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's voice, now faint, echoed in his mind, "Your Infinite Sacred Body strength has reached Single Dragon Might! This is the best I could do for you at this moment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to Primordial, concern flooding his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed the once-vibrant tree had become incredibly weak. Many of its lush green leaves had vanished, and the remaining ones had dulled significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened to you?" he asked, alarmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial explained calmly, "To enable your Divine Body to evolve into an Infinite Sacred Body, I had to expend a considerable amount of energy. However, your Divine Body had great potential, and I ultimately succeeded! Don't worry about me. With your soul power sustaining me, I'll recover quickly and grow even stronger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of relief wash over him. "So, I really am an Infinite Sacred Body now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what does Single Dragon Might mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial continued, "The Infinite Sacred Body doesn't have levels. Its strength is what sets it apart! In this vast cosmos, most races lack the potential to refine their bodies into an Infinite Sacred Body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most races can't refine their bodies into an Infinite Sacred Body?" Osborne echoed, nodding in understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never heard of anyone in the Human Community possessing such a form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps there were a few, but they would be exceedingly rare, the elite few at the very top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even he, if not for his unique opportunities and the fusion with Primordial, would never have dared to dream of achieving an Infinite Sacred Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what was Primordial?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an offshoot of the World Tree!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who else had such an opportunity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you explain what Single Dragon Might actually means?" Osborne pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied, "Be patient. While most races can't achieve an Infinite Sacred Body, some high-ranking races are born incredibly powerful and can attain it simply upon reaching maturity. The most representative of these is the Sacred Dragon Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sacred Dragon Clan?" Osborne repeated, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! The Sacred Dragon Clan is one of the mightiest races in this cosmos! They are born with an Infinite Sacred Body, possessing immense power capable of effortlessly destroying a small planet with sheer strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Single Dragon Might means that your Infinite Sacred Body is now comparable to a newly born Sacred Dragon!" Primordial added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's jaw dropped, and he couldn't help but grimace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Comparable to a newborn Sacred Dragon? Are you kidding me? Right now, I can only measure up to a baby dragon that hasn't even opened its eyes yet? If it just blinks, its power would surpass mine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head in disbelief, feeling both amazed and slightly deflated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial spoke with an air of authority, "You think this isn't enough? Hmph! The Sacred Dragon is one of the mightiest races birthed in this cosmos! The gap between your Human Community and the Sacred Dragon Clan is immense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The starting point for a Sacred Dragon is nearly the endpoint for your Human Community...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, the Human Community has done quite well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There have been many super warriors </span><span>in the Human Community </span><span>who could stand toe-to-toe with an adult Sacred Dragon! But for most races, even at their peak, they might struggle to breach the defenses of a juvenile Sacred Dragon, like ants against a giant..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped at Primordial's words, the weight of the reality settling in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't underestimate Single Dragon Might! According to your Human Community's cultivation levels, if you unleash your Single Dragon Might, the destruction it causes would be comparable to an Ascension One Supernal Deity King using their Divine Ascendance Technique to its fullest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget. You also harbor a fragment of World Force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"World Force is the highest level of power in this realm! It amplifies your strength tremendously! So right now, your physical power alone surpasses that of a typical Ascension One Supernal Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what? You're saying that just my physical strength exceeds that of a regular Ascension One Supernal Deity King?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled to wrap his head around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his ascension to godhood, he had rarely relied on his physical strength in battles. Compared to divine power and elemental power, raw physical might always felt inadequate. No matter how much his Divine Body surpassed others, he knew he could never take on an opponent of equal rank with just his physical strength. They would simply overpower him with their divine or elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Primordial was claiming that his sheer physical strength could rival an Ascension One Supernal Deity King unleashing their full power with the Divine Ascendance Technique!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "</span><span>How</span><span> </span><span>powerful</span><span> is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, are you telling me that I could take out a whole group of peak Deity Kings with just a punch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could knock an Ascension One Supernal Deity King flat on their back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial continued, "This is still due to your low level! Only in the advanced Deity King Level will your Infinite Sacred Body grow even stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As you continue to ascend, you will unlock Denary Dragon Might, Hundredfold Dragon Might, Thousandfold Dragon Might, and even Myriadfold Dragon Might! You'll become even more powerful! In time, with just your raw strength, you could stand at the pinnacle of this cosmos!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even an adult Sacred Dragon would think twice before underestimating you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his breath quicken at Primordial's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he was incredibly grateful for the fusion with Primordial. Without it, how could he have ever achieved the Infinite Sacred Body? How could he have learned so much?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! This is all a bit beyond your reach for now! I need to focus on my training and power up quickly! Unless it's absolutely crucial, don't disturb me! Once I grow stronger, I'll continue to help you, and I'll assist that Lotus within you in evolving! But before that, you should aim for a complete fusion with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Primordial severed the connection, leaving Osborne to ponder his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Infinite Sacred Body! Not only does it make my power terrifying, but my defenses have also skyrocketed! I feel like my physical defense is now stronger than the Supreme Sovereign's Armor! Only a Supernal Deity King could possibly harm me! And as my cultivation level continues to rise, my Infinite Sacred Body will only become more formidable..."</span></p></div>
