        <h1>Chapter 1644 Must Be Stopped</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To secure those Celestial Crystals and curry favor with the Bowman family, Vice Commander Angelo Royston is assembling the most powerful team possible. He's ordered all warriors above the Deity Overlord level from the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan to join in, leaving only a handful behind to maintain the base's operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll have a team of over a hundred people&mdash;at least all Deity Overlords. Even if we encounter the Deathborn army, we'll have a fighting chance and plenty of room to retreat," Edison explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Athena felt a wave of relief wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If that's the case, then I have no objections! For the Soaring Lion Clan and the Huntington family, I'll give it my all! But you better keep me safe, Uncle Edison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison chuckled softly. "You can count on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then stood up, brushing off his clothes. "Go prepare yourself! In half a day, Osborne and Diana will head out. We'll follow them a bit later, making them our vanguard, our bait! That way, we'll stay safer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Athena nodded vigorously, her resolve building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne received a sudden message from Riley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My lord, I just got word that I'm being called up to join the exploration team Vice Commander Angelo Royston is putting together to mine Celestial Crystals at Divine Peak Nine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression turned to surprise as he quickly fired off questions to Riley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After gathering the information, he mumbled to himself, "The Paramount Supreme Clan&mdash;the Bowman family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Deity King Aldrich!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The heir, Alfred!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My involvement in Tobey's death has come to light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Bowman family is already here, but they don't suspect me; instead, they're looking at the Mystic Feather Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A frown knit his brows, concern gnawing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew all too well that the mysterious woman who had defeated Tobey was Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though she had managed to keep her identity concealed, he couldn't shake the feeling that the Bowman family might dig deep enough to uncover the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Hannah hadn't killed Tobey herself, the Bowman family wouldn't hesitate to target her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fallout could also extend to the Gellar family and the entire Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The weight of the situation settled heavily on Osborne's shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Lord Malevolence's command, the Mystic Feather Clan was the only faction willing to extend an olive branch to the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, because of Hannah, harbored a significant fondness for the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want anything to happen to the Mystic Feather Clan, nor did he want anything to happen to the Gellar family or Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have to do something!" he muttered, but with his current strength, he was nowhere near a match for the Paramount Supreme Clan's Bowman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Bowman family really set their sights on the Mystic Feather Clan, he knew he wouldn't be able to change anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, there were options available to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He recalled that the heir Alfred needed Celestial Crystals to push into the Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "I must stop him from breaking through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angelo is gathering all the Deity Overlord warriors from the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan to form a mining team to procure Celestial Crystals to gift to Alfred in hopes of gaining his favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I absolutely cannot allow them to get those Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A fierce determination shone in Osborne's eyes as he formulated a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Riley, stay with their team. Keep a close eye on everything. If anything unusual happens, report to me immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, my lord!" Riley responded without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his orders given, Osborne fell into deep thought, strategizing his next steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even though my power has surged, facing off against Angelo's mining team head-on would be a fool's errand! After all, Angelo is a Deity King warrior! And on top of him, there are over a hundred Deity Overlord warriors, several of whom are at their peak. I simply can't contend with any of them right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I want to stop them from acquiring Celestial Crystals, I can't engage in a direct confrontation. I'll have to leverage the power of the Deathborn army at Divine Peak Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps I can find a way to lead them all to their doom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne considered his strategy, a spark of excitement ignited within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He began rummaging through his Dimensional Bag, reinforcing his confidence as he unearthed various supplies and tools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold smile crept onto his face as he murmured, "Athena, you arranged this mission for me to explore Divine Peak Nine, thinking you could set me up for failure. Little did you know you'd be heading there, too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll be waiting for you at Divine Peak Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, I'll make sure the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan both feel the sting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his determination solidified, Osborne prepared to set out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, he arrived at the east gate of the base, where he was soon joined by Diana. To Osborne's surprise, he discovered that a total of twenty-eight others would accompany them to Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this world, there was never a shortage of those unafraid of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although most people whispered that Diana was cursed and venturing with her into the dangers of Divine Peak Nine was a reckless gamble, there were still plenty willing to tempt fate in exchange for the lucrative Merit Points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ultimately, twenty-eight willing souls took on the mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They would be joining Osborne and Diana to explore the Celestial Crystal mines of Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne surveyed the group, he noted their formidable strength. Each warrior was at least at the peak of Celestial Deity, with five of them having reached the Deity Overlord level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, one was even a mid-stage Deity Overlord.</span></p></div>
