        <h1>Chapter 149 Will You Take Me In</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "Why do you need me to take you in? You're grown up, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Zoe bit her lip tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I want to become as strong as you, so strong that no one would dare to bully me again! Don't worry. I won't be a burden to you. I have power too. I just don't know how to use them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have power too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was extremely surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, ordinary people were the majority, and metahumans were exceedingly rare, each one considered a favorite of the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, metahumans were found only within ancient families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was very rare to find a metahuman among common folk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't expected Zoe to have power. With such power, shouldn't she have been recruited by a major power by now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Could it be that her power was some kind of lesser, supportive power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking this over, Osborne asked, "What power do you have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe hesitated and then said, "I discovered early on that whenever I sing, everyone listens very attentively, and they never interrupt me. Could that be considered a power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished, her face was filled with uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle. "Maybe they listen attentively because your singing is just very pleasant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't really believe it was a power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not just that, Osborne! It's definitely not that simple! How about I sing for you? Just half a song, and you'll definitely feel there's something different."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was somewhat anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and then shook his head. "We need to leave this place! You just fired a gun, and the gunshot will soon attract gang members. We should leave first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for your power, we can explore it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Zoe became anxious. "Then, will you take me in? I really won't be a burden. I can learn anything, and I learn fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He naturally patted Zoe's head and said, "Let's go! From now on, you're with me, but following me could be dangerous. Are you scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not scared!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe looked up firmly and said, "As long as I can be with you, no matter how dangerous it is, I'm not afraid. Plus, I'll definitely protect you in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe spoke as if she were making a solemn vow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, even if Zoe hadn't said anything, Osborne had thought of keeping Zoe by his side because she looked too much like Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were about the same age and looked so alike, and most importantly, both were orphans!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suspected there might be a blood relation between Zoe and Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was someone he had found fifteen years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe had been an orphan as long as she could remember. He wondered if she could possibly be Anastasia's twin sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To figure this out, Osborne was determined to take Zoe with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right now, the priority was to deal with Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne heard the sound of approaching footsteps. It seemed many gang members were on their way. He quickly grabbed Zoe's hand and hurried away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could be surrounded, they ran out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Zoe and said, "Zoe, I have something very important to do now. It's very dangerous, and it's not safe to bring you along. Can you wait here for me, and I'll come back for you after I'm done?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Zoe looked tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tightly grasped Osborne's sleeve as if terrified he would leave her behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head and said, "I don't want to stay behind! I'm afraid you won't want me anymore! Whatever it is you need to do, let me accompany you. I said it. No matter how dangerous, I'm not afraid as long as I can be with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And, I can help you! I know this area very well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation was evident in Zoe's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking into her eyes, Osborne felt his resolve soften. He frowned in hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Taking Zoe to find Raymond?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne worried he might not be able to protect Zoe. Even a stray hit from Raymond could endanger her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was something Osborne could not accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I follow you from a distance? Please, Osborne, don't leave me behind! I've been abandoned by my parents since I was young. Please don't abandon me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Zoe's eyes and suddenly fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was moved and finally softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and said, "Alright! Then you follow me from a distance, but not too close! Also, put on this Defensive Soft Armor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took off his Class B Defensive Soft Armor and gave it to Zoe to wear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Class B Defensive Soft Armor, even if Raymond were to directly attack Zoe, it would take some time to harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, Zoe would be safer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne himself would be in much greater danger while dealing with Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, I need to go to Hyena Gang to find someone. Do you know Hyena Gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe got excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hyena Gang? Of course, I know them! Because I used to survive by washing clothes for Hyena Gang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'll show you the way!"</span></p></div>
