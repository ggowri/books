        <h1>Chapter 1996 The Strongest Ascension Four of Human Community</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascension Four Supernal Deity King Level stood at the pinnacle of warriors in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many leaders had not reached this exalted level among the eighteen Dukedom Level Powers of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Jethro, for example&mdash;he was merely at the Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the backing of the Sanctum of Light, it would be challenging for the Human Community to muster even ten Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings for battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same held for the Unity Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even among the fabled Nine Dark Sovereigns, only a few were the Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, the late Icy Nine had been one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single Ascension Four Supernal Deity King could alter the course of a mid-scale battlefield. Now, the Human Community and the Unity Clan each sent ten of these powerhouses to a grand confrontation&mdash;a clash destined to shake the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ninety-nine percent of the spectators had never seen so many Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings in one place, let alone in combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ferocity of this battle would defy imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, we have already lost six rounds! We cannot afford to lose the next one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speaker was Leopold Hudson, an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, head of the Hudson family and one of the eight Dukedom Level Family of the Human Community. The Hudson family's prominence, ranked among the top three, was due to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leopold was a prodigy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although only an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, his strength rivaled that of Ascension Five powerhouses like Tanner and Julian, who would not dare claim they could defeat him outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His most legendary feat was surviving a battle with Icy Six, one of the Nine Dark Sovereigns, and an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though grievously wounded, Leopold had lived, a testament to his unparalleled prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Tanner or Julian with Ascension Five would think twice before challenging Icy Six, let alone expecting to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This earned Leopold the title "The Strongest Ascension Four of Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leopold had volunteered to join the Ascension Four showdown for this border competition. However, God of Light had excluded his name from the roster, citing the need to preserve his potential for future breakthroughs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leopold had accepted the decision, albeit reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, after losing six of the seven rounds, with Human Alliance's morale plummeting, he no longer remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I have to fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have to win this final match for the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I want to eliminate a few more Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings from the Unity Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Leopold's eyes burned with intense battle intent. He could not wait to step on the battlefield and bring glory to the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light gazed at him, her brows slightly furrowed with loss in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, let Leopold fight! He is our strongest Ascension Four&mdash;our best chance to win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We cannot lose again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is right! God of Light, please let Leopold take the field! I believe in the Hudson family&mdash;he will surely bring victory to our Human Community in this duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, let him fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's pleas grew louder, fueled by frustration and a desperate need for victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leopold stood tall, his eyes shining with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light," he said solemnly, bowing deeply. "Allow me to fight. I will bring victory and restore our Human Community's honor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light sighed, her brows furrowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leopold, I know your strength. Even the Ascension Four Radiant Guardians of the Sanctum of Light would struggle to defeat you in single combat. But this is not a one-on-one duel&mdash;it is a ten-on-ten melee!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are a prodigy, destined to reach the Ascension Five, perhaps even the Ascension Six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If something happens to you, it will be a great loss for the Human Community. That is why I do not want you to take the risk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leopold's heart swelled with gratitude at her concern, but his resolve remained unshaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, we have reached the point of no return. The Human Community is on the brink! There is no time for me to bide and grow stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now is the moment for me to give everything to our people. Please, let me fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His unwavering determination left her with no choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine," she relented. "But remember, victory or defeat matters little compared to your survival. Promise me you will stay safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" Leopold's eyes blazed with fiery resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final round began. Ten Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings from each side stepped onto the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When God of Light saw the opposing lineup from Unity Clan, her expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is the Paramount Supreme Clan," someone whispered, their voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All ten of them... are all from the Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air grew heavy with despair. The Paramount Supreme's aura was overwhelming, their strength undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leopold's face turned grim. He had not expected the Paramount Supreme Clan to intervene, let alone send ten of their warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though hailed as the Human Community's strongest Ascension Four, Leopold knew the harsh truth: the gap between him and the Paramount Supreme Clan's prodigies was not due to talent but resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, retreat was not an option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!" he roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle began with a thunderous explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascension Four Supernal Deity King Level battlefield became a maelstrom of energy, each clash shaking the heavens. Ordinary spectators could only feel the earth-shattering power, unable to discern the combatants' movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twenty combatants unleashed their full might, their attacks threatening to rend the very fabric of reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the Human Community's side, there was Leopold, accompanied by the Ascension Four Radiant Guardians, who had been personally trained and mentored by the God of Light from the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their opponents, however, were ten prodigies from the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, blood sprayed across the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Leopold's!</span></p></div>
