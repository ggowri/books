        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It really wasn't easy." Osborne smiled wryly. Nearly two years of cultivation had completely immersed him; he spent every moment studying and comprehending, finally mastering the construction of the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, he could only construct a Level 1 Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Level 2 Cosmic Translocator is more complex and requires learning much more. With Osborne's current level, he still cannot construct it entirely on his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, with his previous experience and knowledge, Osborne believes he can fully master the skills to independently construct Level 2 or even Level 3 Cosmic Translocators in a shorter time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the Level 4 Cosmic Translocator, even if Osborne learns it, he cannot construct the translocator alone because he discovered that his spatial power essence is not strong enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The spatial power essence at the Primary Sacredness Level can at most construct a Level 3 Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, it takes a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thorned Veil hasn't sent any news yet, so I still have some time. I'll continue learning to construct Level 2 and Level 3 Cosmic Translocators. If I can master them, no matter which major power I go to, I'll gain immense respect. I won't have to worry about cultivation resources for the rest of my life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cosmic Translocator builders on the Racial Convergence Planet are an independent profession with extremely high status. Even those who can only construct part of a Cosmic Translocator are offered high prices by major powers. If someone can independently build a Cosmic Translocator, that is truly remarkable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, even the Fairy Moon Sect doesn't have anyone who can independently construct a Level 1 Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Adriana knew Osborne could independently construct a Cosmic Translocator so quickly, she would definitely invite him to join the Fairy Moon Sect for the fourth time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Adriana wouldn't be taking Osborne as a student but inviting him to become an official Elder of the Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For major powers, being able to construct Cosmic Translocators anytime and anywhere not only serves as a way to make money but also makes it more convenient to mine resource-bearing planets in distant Stellar Regions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, there are many benefits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no intention of joining any major power. He learned to construct the Cosmic Translocator solely to improve himself. He quietly studied and advanced rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, more than a year had passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By now, Osborne had been cultivating for three years, and on this day, he finally fully mastered the construction of a Level 2 Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as he has enough materials, he can single-handedly build a Level 2 Cosmic Translocator within an hour.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He can even construct most Level 3 Cosmic Translocators.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was already very satisfied with this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he simulated constructing a Level 2 Cosmic Translocator in his mind, taking a total of fifty-six minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "Fifty-six minutes, four minutes faster than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And to build a Level 1 Cosmic Translocator, I now only need ten minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, it's still a bit too slow. If I'm being hunted or in another dangerous situation, I simply won't have this much time to slowly build a Cosmic Translocator to escape. Next, I need to practice more and make the construction process both simpler and more efficient."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Building a Level 1 Cosmic Translocator must be completed within one minute. Building a Level 2 Cosmic Translocator should be done within ten minutes, or even faster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I can do it, easily building a Level 1 Cosmic Translocator, then I can abandon interdimensional travel in the future. The distance of interdimensional travel is still too short; truly powerful enemies can easily catch up to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But even a Level 1 Cosmic Translocator can teleport across incredibly vast distances, up to one light-year... that's nearly six trillion miles."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even the powerful Ms. Alba absolutely wouldn't be able to catch up with me. Not even a true Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior could catch up with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to seize the time to fully master the Level 3 Cosmic Translocator, but at this moment, he had to stop because he heard a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Angela looking for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be news about the Frenetic Storm Warband?" Osborne was a bit excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, he had trained for three years. With the hundredfold time acceleration, only eleven days had passed in the outside world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eleven days were enough for the people of Thorned Veil to gather information from Vice City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly ended his retreat and opened the door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, there's news!" Angela said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became even more excited. "Did Thorned Veil find Frenetic Storm Warband's location?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela shook her head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the disappointment in Osborne's eyes, she quickly said, "Though Thorned Veil didn't find Frenetic Storm Warband's location, they did find the deputy leader, Layne Dussel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Layne is one of Frenetic Storm Warband's three deputy leaders, an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior, and he's currently in Vice City's Blossom Cage!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they didn't find Frenetic Storm Warband's location, finding Layne, the deputy leader, was enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as they captured Layne, they would naturally know Frenetic Storm Warband's location and even learn about his parents' situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne became a bit anxious. "In that case, let's head to Vice City to find Layne now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne was ready to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Angela stopped Osborne and shook her head at him. "Osborne, don't rush. Catching Layne won't be easy. I mentioned before, Layne is in Blossom Cage, and Blossom Cage is no simple place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Blossom Cage is a brothel, but it has a powerful backing. Even those Space Pirates in Vice City and the wanted criminals from the Stellar Region rarely dare to cause trouble there. As long as Layne stays inside Blossom Cage, we can't make a move on him. We'll have to wait until he leaves."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned. "Blossom Cage? Powerful backing? Hardly anyone in Vice City dares to cause trouble at Blossom Cage?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let's go take a look first and wait for an opportunity. I'm here to save my parents, and now that I finally have a lead, no matter who tries to stop me, I'll fight them to the end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sensing Osborne's killing intent, Angela did not stop him further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the three left Emberveil Haven and headed to Vice City through Thorned Veil's Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced at Thorned Veil's Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just a level-one Cosmic Translocator, but it's enough to teleport to Vice City on the other side of Inferno Planet. Still, this Cosmic Translocator is too poor, clearly built through collective effort, unable to achieve its maximum teleportation effect."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I were to build it, the maximum teleportation distance would at least double. For the same distance, the consumption of Sacred Crystals would be reduced by at least half."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cosmic Translocator is activated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, they vanished from Thorned Veil and appeared on the other side of Inferno Planet in Vice City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as the three appeared, a powerful attack struck them without warning.</span></p></div>
