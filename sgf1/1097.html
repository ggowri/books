        <h1>Chapter 1096 Stalling</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett breathed a sigh of relief at Osborne's agreement and exchanged glances with the others. "Then let's do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nearly 100 Class S warriors of the League of Divine Descent now stared at the three hundred-plus Aberrant clones with lethal intent. None of them wanted to go down this road, but they had no choice. They would perish here if they didn't wipe out the clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, along with the 4,800 Blood Demon members, Wesson, Bryce, Greyson, and the many skilled fighters of the Augustine family, had them completely surrounded. There was no way they could hold out against such a force. Their only option was to kill every last Aberrant clone to secure their survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!" Everett shouted, no longer hesitating as he made the first move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inwardly, Everett swore that if he survived today, he would stop at nothing to kill Osborne. He couldn't allow Osborne to keep growing stronger, or the League of Divine Descent's plan to dominate the world would be at risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, just wait!" Everett fumed silently. "The more triumphant you are now, the deeper your regret will be later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett led nearly a hundred of the League of Divine Descent's Class S warriors into battle, and they clashed fiercely with the 300 clones. The force of the combat was so intense that the very canyon around them trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the Aberrant clones outnumbered the League's Class S warriors nearly four to one, their overall strength was inferior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there were not just ordinary Class S fighters among the League's ranks. Two were top-tier Class S warriors, and over a dozen were S+ veterans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, the Aberrant clones were all merely standard Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the very start of the battle, the League of Divine Descent inflicted devastating losses on the clones, but the clones didn't sit idly by. They retaliated with everything they had, and soon, casualties began to mount on both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the League continued to kill more clones, the tide of battle shifted, revealing the power of sheer numbers. Though the League held the upper hand, their casualties increased with every victory. Essentially, one of their Class S warriors fell for every ten clones they killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, are you really going to let them go?" Wesson approached Osborne, his expression grim as he watched the brutal fight between the League of Divine Descent and the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson added, "Godfather, we could easily wipe them all out with our current strength! There's no need to spare the League of Divine Descent. We've already passed the point of peace. Even if you let them go, they'll come back to take revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne listened, then smiled faintly. "I know," he replied. "Right now, yes, we could take them all out. But we're talking about over 400 Class S warriors. Do you know how heavy our losses would be if we did that? How many of our own would die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Blood Demon members I've spent so much effort cultivating, at least a third would die. Maybe even more than half!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, when people are cornered, they can unleash unimaginable strength. The losses will be catastrophic if we try to eliminate over 400 Class S warriors, even with the combined might of the Blood Demon members and me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson fell silent at Osborne's words. He knew Osborne was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Losing a third of the Blood Demon members in exchange for eliminating over 400 Class S warriors would be considered a massive victory that few could even dream of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a well-trained, well-coordinated force like the Blood Demon members, armed with superior weapons and led by Osborne's overwhelming power, could entertain the idea of such a feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Osborne or the Blood Demon members, they wouldn't stand a chance of winning this fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But was it worth losing over a third of their forces to kill these 400 Class S warriors?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least from Osborne's perspective, it wasn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson believed it was worth it but didn't dare voice it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Wesson frowned and said, "Godfather, are you really planning to let the League of Divine Descent go? We could wait until they're done tearing each other apart and then finish off the League warriors ourselves. By then, they'll be so weakened that taking them out will be a breeze!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the promises and oaths you just made, we don't have to honor those at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at Wesson, surprised by his ruthlessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the League of Divine Descent to wipe out the Aberrant clones and then turning on them afterward? Wesson's thinking was in line with Osborne's own thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, things were not as simple as they seemed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded calmly, "What you've thought of, the people from the League of Divine Descent have surely considered as well. The only reason they agreed to my terms is likely because they're stalling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's expression shifted. "Stalling? Godfather, are you saying they have reinforcements coming? They weren't negotiating in good faith, but just buying time for backup to arrive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and sneered, "Exactly. There's no other reason I can think of. Reinforcements are definitely on the way!"</span></p></div>
