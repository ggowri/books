        <h1>Chapter 489 Bite the Bait</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron's furious roar echoed in the conference hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the senior members of the Luther family dared not make a sound at this moment, and their expressions were extremely solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Jayden Luther broke the ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Yaron, according to our intelligence, Osborne just took Clarissa and Wallace onto a luxury yacht!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isaac has just sent a message requiring us to prepare a level three ancient magic weapon and 10 billion dollars in cash to redeem Wallace at sea!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Meanwhile, Osborne arrogantly announced that he would throw Wallace into the sea to feed the sharks if he didn't receive the ransom money and the ancient magic weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's the location of the place where we should deposit the ransom money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron was inflamed as soon as he heard Osborne's requirement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "A level three ancient magic weapon and 10 billion dollars? Osborne is insane. Does he really think that he is already the overlord of </span><span>Dampston</span><span>? How dare this brat blackmail the Luther family?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron clenched his fists, hoping he could tear Osborne apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jayden said, "Yaron, I don't think it's bad for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you talking about? Jayden, is your brain filled with shit? Or do you think once my son is killed by Osborne, your son could be the heir instead?" Yaron said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jayden was embarrassed by his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Yaron, calm down first! This is not a bad thing. You want to kill Osborne, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, if he hides in the Augustine Estate, it's hard for us to besiege him. But now, after kidnapping Wallace, he was so arrogant that he only brought a woman and played on a yacht!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He also left a location for us to give him the money! If we coordinate with the Walker family, the Marion family, and the Hawthorne family, it's much more likely to </span><span>slay this bastard, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Jayden finished speaking, Yaron was stunned with a gleam of hope in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he said, "Osborne got on my nerves just now! You're right, Jayden, this is an opportunity. That haughty brat left us a chance to kill him. I want him dead tonight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Yaron immediately took action. "Everyone, get ready! I will go to the Walker Estate right now and discuss the plan to deal with Osborne with Shawn. Once you receive my order, set off immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jayden nodded and quickly asked, "Yaron, do we have to prepare 10 billion dollars and the level three ancient magic weapon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron thought about it and sneered, "Yes! Get everything ready. These ransoms will paralyze Osborne's mental defense! As long as he dies, these things will come back, and they will come back double."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Yaron left quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, in a secret meeting room of the Walker Estate, people from the most powerful four families in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> gathered again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yaron, are you sure this isn't a tarp that Osborne set to allure us?" Shawn asked with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron said disdainfully, "How could it be? Everything is just a coincidence! Osborne is just possessed by greed and blackmailed us! He doesn't even know that the Luther family has already formed an alliance with you and is preparing to kill him. It's a good chance. We must act immediately and kill him at sea!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn frowned, still feeling something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shawn, you are not scared, are you? It was you who came up with the idea of besieging Osborne, but now you are wavering," Yaron said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added, "My son was kidnapped by that bastard. If you are unwilling to help, there's no need to ally with you. You can figure out a way to defeat him on your own! You worried that it's Osborne's trap, but why should we be so fretted even if it really is a trap? You have known his power, and we have the help of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. Even if he is scheming something, it will only bury himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn heaved a long sigh of relief when he heard this and seemed relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. In terms of our power, we don't have to worry about his plot! In this case, let's start the siege! Hurry up and tell all the powerful metahumans to head to that location! I will contact the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> immediately. This time, Osborne will be buried in the sea forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, the meeting was dismissed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, they each summoned the strongest metahumans in their family. All those who had reached Class A- were present, forming a deterring and powerful army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It contained five Class A masters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were more than forty Class A- metahumans, and almost the entire Wise Order was dispatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hid their identities, sneaked into the Luther family's yacht, and quickly rushed towards the location Osborne sent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Osborne was hugging Clarissa and fishing on the yacht.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast ocean surged rough waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yacht was floating up and down, and Clarissa leaned on Osborne's body in his arms, rubbing against his skin, which made both of them a little distracted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, nothing beyond our expectations will happen with tonight's operation, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was a little worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "I don't know! But in order to destroy them all as soon as possible, I can only take the risk! Protect yourself later. If the situation is not good for you, come to me immediately, and I will take you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he found his fishing rod moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled the fishing rod hard and immediately caught a tuna weighing at least 55 pounds. It kept jumping around on the boat but soon stopped struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he heard something from his headphones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed and said, "They have already started to act! Our fish bit the bait!"</span></p></div>
