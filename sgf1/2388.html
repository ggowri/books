        <h1>Chapter 2307 Agatha Is Gone?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal peak of the snow-capped mountain stretched out as a vast, level expanse, swathed in a thick mantle of snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne couldn't have cared less about the scenic beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift scan using his Satan's Eye, he caught sight of several Frost-kissed Hearts glistening in the mist above the summit. Just as he was about to rejoice in his luck, something made him come to a dead stop&mdash;an ice sculpture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stepped closer for a better look, Osborne was left gobsmacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized that ice sculpture in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Agatha? She's here! No wonder I couldn't track her down! She must have reached the summit ages ago! And... it seems she tried to soak up the energy of a Frost-kissed Heart and was frozen to death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Agatha, who was entombed in ice. Twelve small shields surrounded her, each pulsating with a potent energy that kept the mountain's deadly cold at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Sacred Artifacts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A whole set of them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twelve shields around Agatha were no run-of-the-mill items. They were a complete set of defensive Sacred Artifacts, offering insanely powerful protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chances were, it was this set of defensive gear that had enabled Agatha to penetrate the seventh layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm and make it all the way to the mountain's peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The defensive capabilities of this set were probably not too far off from the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, alas, Agatha had attempted to absorb the power of a Frost-kissed Heart, and the overpowering energy had coursed through her body, turning her into a block of ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her precious defensive artifacts had been utterly useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha was now frozen solid, from the core of her being outwards. Osborne couldn't detect the slightest flicker of life within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a long sigh. "What a tragic waste! She was already a world-class prodigy, having merged three powers at the Supernal Deity King Level. Her future was as bright as a supernova! And now, all for the sake of a Frost-kissed Heart, she's frozen to death right here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's voice rang in his head, thick with sarcasm. "Pot calling the kettle black!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've also merged three powers. Your future's just as promising, but you still couldn't resist the allure of the Frost-kissed Heart, could you? Putting your life on the line to climb up here. If I hadn't told you how to use those things, you'd be as frozen as she is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose sheepishly. "It's different! I've got an immortal body! Even if things went south here, I'm confident I could pull through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial let out a soft chuckle. "And what makes you think she didn't have some ace up her sleeve? Take a good look. She's not a goner yet! She's been frozen by the power of the Frost-kissed Heart for ages, and she's still hanging in there! She's a lot tougher than she seems!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's words took Osborne by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Agatha isn't completely dead? No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne edged closer to her and gingerly tried to pick up her energy signature, but there wasn't even a faint glimmer of life, making it crystal clear that she was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Primordial never shot from the hip. Osborne wavered for a moment, then cranked up his Satan's Eye to full power to scan Agatha's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn, she's got an amazing figure! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought with a sigh.</span><br><span>What a pity she is a corpse now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next second, Osborne went stock-still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside Agatha's body, he spotted a flame. It was still burning, but sputtering, as if it could go out any second!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within that flame, Osborne could sense a faint trace of Agatha's life force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is that?" Osborne was completely flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial explained, "That's her Phoenix Flame! She's got ancient Phoenix blood coursing through her veins. It's powerful blood carrying the pure Phoenix Flame! That flame is what's keeping a glimmer of her life going and stopping her from kicking the bucket completely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But she's at death's door! Her Phoenix Flame isn't fully developed yet, and she underestimated the might of the Frost-kissed Heart, which is why she's frozen solid! In a day at most, that Phoenix Flame will sputter out, and then she'll be a goner for real!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And once that happens, there'll be no saving her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Agatha in shock.</span><br><span>Phoenix Flame?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What're you thinking? You want to save her? I'd strongly advise against it! The wisest move is to just let her croak. Then you can scoop up all the Frost-kissed Hearts on this mountaintop! And those Sacred Artifacts of hers are no joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With that set of defensive Sacred Artifacts, your power will shoot through the roof! Even an average Empyrean Sacredness powerhouse won't be able to crack your defenses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And... there's an even more potent Sacred Artifact inside her body! Looks like a flute crafted from ancient Phoenix bones, packing a serious punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let her kick the bucket here, and they'll all be yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's words made Osborne stop and think.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just stand idly by and watch Agatha die? Then take her Phoenix Cry Bone Flute? Grab her set of defensive Sacred Artifacts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It does seem like I'll be raking it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barely knew Agatha and never exchanged a word with her. Her fate was, frankly, none of his business. Osborne had zero obligation to play the hero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, even if he did pull her bacon out of the fire, would she even be grateful? She might just assume he had a hidden agenda, maybe even turn into a future pain in his ass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew better than anyone&mdash;gratitude was a rare commodity in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letting Agatha kick the bucket and scooping up her Sacred Artifacts? That was the cold, hard, logical choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after mulling it over, Osborne shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He told Primordial, "Nah, forget it. If she was already six feet under when I found her, I'd have snagged those Sacred Artifacts without a second thought. But she's clinging on, and I just happened to stumble across her? That's gotta be fate, right? If I just stood by and watched her freeze, I wouldn't exactly lose sleep over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I sure as hell wouldn't be cracking a smile either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a grin towards the frozen Agatha, Osborne added, "Looks like you hit the jackpot! I'll come play knight in shining armor later, but first... I'm gonna hoover up all these Frost-kissed Hearts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne set about his task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The summit's frigid air was biting, but it had spawned a rich bounty of Frost-kissed Hearts. Finding them wouldn't have been a challenge even without his Satan's Eye. Still, Osborne used it to meticulously comb the peak, discovering far more of the precious items than he'd dared hope for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A staggering forty-nine Frost-kissed Hearts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bingo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne worked swiftly, employing the crimson roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to ensnare each of the forty-nine Hearts and stash them within his own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having secured his prize, Osborne finally turned his attention to Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's words echoed once more, "You sure you wanna save her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you think that's a little boneheaded? Those Sacred Artifacts are no joke! You miss this chance, and you'll be kicking yourself trying to find artifacts of that caliber again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's the one who decided to roll the dice and come up here. If she eats it, that's on her! All you gotta do is nothing, and she'll be pushing up daisies before you know it. It ain't your problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really gonna play the hero?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne simply shook his head with a smile. "My mind's made up, so save your breath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne put his plan into action.</span></p></div>
