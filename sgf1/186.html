        <h1>Chapter 186 Be Exposed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was flushed, but she did not move her eyes away. Instead, she looked at Osborne boldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, do you think I'm stupid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was only five years old at that time, and I only saw you that one time. But that's exactly what I thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa continued, "Unfortunately, I could no longer find you. Osborne, for fifteen years, I had no news of you. I tried many ways but couldn't find you. I thought my fate was already determined, and I had to marry Apollo when I was twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because if I do that, except me, my parents, my grandfather, and all the Radcliffe family members will be happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But just when I was ready to accept my fate calmly, Osborne, you appeared again! I was thrilled to see you again. It's not because you saved my life fifteen years ago but because I saw an opportunity to change my fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, do you really want to pursue me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's eyes seemed to be glowing, with intense anticipation and nervousness in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't hesitate before saying, "Yes, I do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because you like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face turned even redder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but still said truthfully, "Clarissa, I don't want to lie to you. Liking you is only part of the reason, but there are more reasons! You can think that it is fate that guides me to pursue you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, Godfather's successor test was the guidance of his fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he indeed liked Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was beautiful, smart, and excellent. No man would not like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The guidance of fate?" murmured Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, she continued, "Then, are you willing to marry me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was suddenly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that something was wrong with Clarissa today. Although pursuing Clarissa and even marrying her was his goal, he did not think that the relationship between him and Clarissa had reached this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "I haven't even started pursuing Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is Clarissa suddenly saying this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is Clarissa more anxious than me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's wrong with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked in confusion, "Clarissa, what's wrong with you today? Why are you suddenly saying this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip and said seriously, "Osborne, I just want an answer. Are you willing to be with me and fight against fate? Are you willing to marry me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Answer me, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's seriousness made Osborne a bit at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he nodded. "Clarissa, of course, I am willing to marry you! To be able to marry a girl like you is a good thing that many men dare not even think about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's not work if I am willing or not, right? You just said that the person who marries you must have sufficient background and power and be outstanding enough. Otherwise, he will not be able to bear your fate power and will die suddenly, and it can even cause the decline of the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I can?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Osborne say that he was willing to marry her, Clarissa blushed once again. She said shyly, "Osborne, I believe you can! You can deceive Aunt Donna, Barlyn, and even Apollo, but you can't deceive me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, the new boss of Skyefall Security is you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was suddenly shocked at Clarissa's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had never expected that Clarissa actually knew he was the new boss of Skyefall Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How did she know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I should have never been exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be because of Clarissa's power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked at Osborne's reaction and burst out laughing. Suddenly, she was so beautiful when smiling that Osborne's expression was frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa blushed and said quickly, "Osborne, your performance now makes me more certain! In fact, I was just guessing! But obviously, I guessed it right. You are indeed the mysterious new boss of Skyefall Security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you guess it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was more confused, thinking, "Could it be guessed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was somewhat proud. "Yes, I guessed it! Others didn't notice the eye contact between you and Valentin, but I did! Valentin disguised himself very well, but every time there was an important decision, he would look at you implicitly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why were you so sure that you could rent Skyefall Security's Class A defense system? Aunt Donna thought Skyefall Security wanted to befriend the Radcliffe family to fight against the suppression of the Chevalier family. But I knew it was not the main reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The main reason was that you are the boss of Skyefall Security. Of course, you can rent the Class A defense system to the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, Judith, the vice president of Skyefall Security, treated us badly. You said she was going to be fired soon, and she really was fired. It was definitely not a coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, why do Sharon and Violet both support you in being the bodyguard captain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I have long suspected that you are the new boss of Skyefall Security. Your identity and background are not as simple as everyone thinks. Skyefall Security did not hesitate to offend Apollo and even made a 10-billion-dollar gambling decision with Apollo because of me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of this, Clarissa felt a bit shy.</span></p></div>
