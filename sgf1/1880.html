        <h1>Chapter 1879 Something Felt Wrong</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor snorted and said, "Go and bring Kurt back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! Yes!" More than a dozen people responded in alarm, quickly leaving the ice crystal castle and making their way toward Astral Wolf Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately activated the Satan's Eye. It swept over the group, providing him with a clear view of their situation, even revealing the contents of their Dimensional Bags.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's delight, he spotted what he was looking for. In one of the Dimensional Bags, he counted ten pieces of Ultimate Luminous Armor and three Ultimate divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was the very item he had been coveting&mdash;the Hammer of Thor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement surged within him&mdash;once the deal was finalized, the Hammer of Thor would be his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, a sense of confusion gnawed at him. "What on earth is Trevor thinking? Is he really willing to give these over to me? Does he have no backup plan? No hidden agenda?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow. If he were in Trevor's position, would he really allow a perceived loser to threaten him and willingly part with such valuable items?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! Trevor must have something up his sleeve that I'm not seeing," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slow down! Approach carefully! If you make me nervous and I accidentally hurt him, I doubt any of you will make it out alive!" Osborne shouted at the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, he considered how Trevor might make him pay for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen individuals exchanged glances, muttering inwardly, "Are you scared? You had the guts to kidnap Trevor's son and extort him, yet you're afraid because we're moving a bit faster?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their thoughts, they complied with Osborne's instructions and slowed their pace, inching toward Astral Wolf Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Trevor observed this in silence. His expression remained calm and icy, revealing nothing of his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, "How does Trevor intend to deal with me? Has he figured out my identity? If he knows I'm Theodore, the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community, he must realize I possess spatial powers! He might even be aware that I can create Spatial Clones!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of alarm washed over Osborne. If Trevor had truly deduced his identity and understood his abilities, then Trevor would undoubtedly have methods to counteract his spatial powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's confidence in using Kurt as leverage stemmed from his spatial capabilities; otherwise, he wouldn't have dared to threaten the Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Trevor really wants to confront me, he'll surely find a way to neutralize my spatial power. But how?" he wondered as Satan's Eye continued to scan the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's expression shifted as he noticed something unusual. While there was nothing particularly striking about the group, they each bore a strange tattoo on their backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All men and women had these tattoos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed to emanate a peculiar energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became alert. Although he couldn't pinpoint what the tattoos were, he sensed they posed a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Trevor must have a plan to counter me. I can't wait for him to act; I need to strike first," he concluded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he sprang into action, creating another Spatial Clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the clone stationed at Astral Wolf Peak seized Kurt by the neck, hoisting him up before slamming him down violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt hit the ground hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene shocked not only the onlookers but also Trevor, who leaped from his ice crystal throne, fury flashing in his eyes as he glared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! What the hell are you doing?" Trevor bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered back, "What am I doing? Trevor, do you really think you can play games with me? Do you believe I wouldn't dare to kill your son?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you want to play tricks, let's take this to the bitter end! I'm going to kill your son right now and leave you with nothing but regret!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he hoisted Kurt up once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt, panic-stricken, shouted, "Dad, save me! Please, save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone's attention was drawn toward the Spatial Clone at Astral Wolf Peak, leaving them oblivious to another Spatial Clone that had just appeared in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this new clone stood a young man who had in his Dimensional Bag the 10 pieces of Ultimate Luminous Armor that Osborne coveted, along with the Hammer of Thor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring them here!" the Spatial Clone shouted.</span></p></div>
