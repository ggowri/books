        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the two were about to fight, Godfather interrupted them after waving his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "You guys shouldn't fight each other internally when there's a big enemy. Since you all want to choose </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> and </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, you can be together! Together with Campbell behind </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> and Yevette behind </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, the two of you will be responsible for guarding these four provinces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The industries in these four provinces will be divided equally for you two to guard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Godfather didn't give the two another chance to speak and settle things down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the remaining four people picked out the regions they would be guarding respectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them had to guard a coastal province and an inland province.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area Osborne and Owen were to guard was right in the center. To their left were Emma and Matthew, and to their right were Lance and Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that it's been decided, you guys should go back and get ready!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, this is not just </span><span>heir</span><span> selection but a war of survival for the Augustine family. You must unite all the forces you can and don't underestimate the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, it is up to you to decide whether the Augustine family will have a future or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Godfather's body flashed and disappeared in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders of the Augustine family all looked at each other at this moment, scattering and surrounding them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were sixty elders in the Augustine family, each of whom was above Class AA, </span><span>and at least ten of them had already reached Class AAA, making them incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would also participate in this heir selection, where they could choose to support a recognized heir and become their assistant in defending the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the six recognized heirs, the one who could get more support from the elders would gain a huge advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, each of the sixty-four elders of the Augustine family would choose the recognized heirs they wanted to support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the number of elders who chose to support Matthew was the largest, amounting to twenty. It could be seen from this that Matthew had the best connections in the Augustine family, and he had the most powerful tactics, making more elders favor him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of elders choosing to support Vincent, who was claimed to be the most powerful of the young generation in the Augustine family, was also large, amounting to eighteen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Emma was claimed to be the most talented of the young generation from the Augustine family, and she received the support of twelve elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only eight elders supported Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were four elders supporting Lance, who came from the branch bloodline in </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne who came last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all the elders dispersed, only two elders came to Osborne's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them was an acquaintance of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the third elder, Caleb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other was an old woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised. He hadn't expected that there would be two elders from the main bloodlines of the Augustine family who would indeed support him, including even the third elder, Caleb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had expected that no elder would back him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Osborne's surprised expression, Caleb patted his shoulder and smiled, "Kid, why are you so surprised? I told you a long time ago that I think you can make miracles. Isn't it normal that I chose to support you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that, Osborne instantly felt grateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought earlier that Caleb was deliberately trying to cause him trouble by flattering him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it seemed like Caleb was truly favoring him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurriedly expressed his gratitude. "Mr. Caleb Augustine, thanks for your support, and I won't let you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb nodded and didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the other old woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't recognize the old woman, and they had never met. Why hadn't she supported Vincent, the most powerful, Matthew, the most resourceful, and Emma, the most gifted, instead of him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old woman nodded at Osborne and said, "My name is Janet, and I'm an elder </span><span>ranked fifteenth in the Augustine family. Everyone else doesn't favor you, but I think you're great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regarding the previous fight, everyone else thought you were lucky, but I know it was definitely not that simple! So, I'm willing to bet on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, you have to go for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Janet stood beside Caleb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked touched and expressed his gratitude again. "Mrs. Janet Augustine, don't worry. I'll do my best!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there were only two elders supporting Osborne, and he was the least of the six heirs, he was satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne had expected none.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne represented the branch bloodline in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, who had just returned to the Augustine family, so their overall power was the weakest of the nine branch bloodlines in the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a situation, no one, except for a few lunatics, probably thought Osborne had a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the heir selection that followed was no longer a test of individual power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a war with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, individual power was insignificant, and no one could change the outcome of the battle with their own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the six recognized heirs, the more supporters behind them, the stronger they would be because the more masters they had, the more likely they were going to get a good result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His personal power was not the best among the six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The forces behind him were the weakest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was rare enough that there were two elders willing to be Osborne's supporters and favor him with a victory in the heir selection in such a situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Owen grunted coldly and said indifferently, "Osborne, I didn't expect you to get the support of two elders, so I truly underestimated you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you still don't have any chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since we're going to work together to defend the four provinces, I hope you won't drag me down when the time comes. You should hold out for a while longer without asking me for help!"</span></p></div>
