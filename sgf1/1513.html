        <h1>Chapter 1512 Hannah Asked for Help</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the estate was protected by a divine power barrier, making it difficult for even a Deity Overlord powerhouse to break through with brute force, Osborne still preferred to avoid unnecessary trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is fully restored, I'll regain my immortality! My strength will increase, and the Blood Demon members will be able to emerge from the Dimensional Microcosm. Then, I can bring them into Spark of Blaze, which will significantly boost our power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When that happens, we won't have to fear any of the major factions from the Hundred Races," he thought, determination fueling his resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne prepared to slip away using his spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, he noticed a figure appearing at the gate of the courtyard, followed by a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? She's dropping by?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, he opened the door to let the shadowy figure inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was, of course, his neighbor&mdash;the mysterious woman shrouded in a veil of black mist, so elusive that even his Satan's Eye couldn't penetrate her secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What brings you here?" Osborne asked, trying to keep his tone neutral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman replied calmly, "What's wrong? Can't I come over if there's nothing going on? You said I could drop by anytime, and now that I'm here, you don't seem very welcoming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, "I'm quite busy. If you don't have anything important, it might be best if you head back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She chuckled. "Planning to leave, are you? There are plenty of spies from the various factions lurking outside, keeping a close eye on you. If you step out, they won't hesitate to strike."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Thanks for the heads-up, but I'm not planning to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't kid yourself; I can see through lies!" she shot back, and with that, the black mist slowly dissipated, revealing an extraordinarily beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes sparkled with an intensity that seemed to pierce right into his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the slave market, she had already met Osborne face-to-face, so in front of him, she no longer needed to maintain any mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can see through lies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, he thought of Clarissa. One of her powers was the ability to detect falsehoods. It had been a long time since Clarissa was taken by Isa, and he wondered how they were faring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Please, don't let anything bad happen to Isa, Clarissa, Emma, or Austin. Once I'm stronger, I'll make my way to the West Zone to find you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's voice broke through his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you thinking about other women? Staring at my face while imagining someone else? How rude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wrinkled her nose in mock disapproval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook himself from his reverie and replied coolly, "Just get to the point. What do you want from me? Need my help with something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laughter rang out like chimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're quite sharp! Yes, I'm here because I need your assistance. But I was worried you'd turn me down right away, so I thought I'd introduce myself first. I'm Hannah Gellar from the Gellar family of the Mystic Feather Clan. I also have a bit of Human Community blood in me&mdash;my mother was from there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Hannah extended her hand toward Osborne, a playful expression on her face as if to say, "Aren't you surprised?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked, momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're Hannah?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a moment to take in her appearance again, genuinely surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought you were blind! The rumors said you couldn't see and that you had disabilities that made it hard for you to walk. And you have Human Community blood? No wonder you're interested in marrying me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's cheeks flushed with a hint of pink at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you rambling on about? When did I ever say I wanted to marry you? I'm just looking to marry into the Human Community! And you? You're just one of the candidates&mdash;by far the least suitable one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah tossed her head, pouting as she wrinkled her nose adorably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "So I'm your worst option? Glad to hear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's eyes widened in surprise, clearly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by that? You're afraid that I'll actually marry you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged nonchalantly. "Let's get back to why you came here. What do you need my help with? Given that the Mystic Feather Clan has been looking out for the Human Community in Wild Flame City, and considering you have that Human Community blood in you, not to mention the fact that you practically gave me this estate, I'll do my best to help&mdash;assuming it doesn't interfere with my own plans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah huffed, crossing her arms, "So now you finally realize I'm not here to cause you harm? You were acting like I was a thief in the night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but roll his eyes inwardly; honestly, with some of the things she'd done, anyone would be cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he genuinely felt more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything he'd gathered about the Mystic Feather Clan, the Gellar family, and Hannah suggested they'd always looked out for the Human Community and held positive feelings toward it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to ask for your help because our Gellar family's Essence Crystal mine has shut down recently due to a massive influx of Deathborn..." Hannah explained, her expression turning serious.</span></p></div>
