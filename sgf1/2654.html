        <h1>Chapter 2538 Shocked Agatha and Angela-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The effect of Top-grade Dragon Elixir is comparable to Elven Sacred Water. Osborne had used Elven Sacred Water before. But after using nearly a hundred drops, Elven Sacred Water no longer had any effect on him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Top-grade Dragon Elixir should be similar to Elven Sacred Water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the effect of Legendary Dragon Elixir is stronger. Adriana told Osborne that twenty drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir are enough, and any more would lose its effect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne only gave Angela and Agatha each one hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir and twenty drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Dragon Elixirs will definitely greatly enhance their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne is so strong now largely thanks to nearly a hundred drops of Elven Sacred Water. Otherwise, his space, darkness, thunder, and fire elemental essence would hardly have reached Empyrean Sacredness so early.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that case, he wouldn't have been able to comprehend his unique combat skills, Solar Sacred Arrow and Warfare Blade Technique.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, the effect of Dragon Elixir is powerful, and Legendary Dragon Elixir is even more precious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from Osborne, all others who entered the Phantomagic Realm, including those over twenty warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, collectively obtained only two hundred drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This shows just how precious the Legendary Dragon Elixir is.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela and Agatha were both shocked because Osborne had given them so much, and it was incredibly precious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They certainly knew that a hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir and twenty drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir were far more valuable than several Legendary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they bit their lower lips, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, Agatha, I have something else for you. I almost forgot." Osborne suddenly took out some more items.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were some seemingly ordinary branches with a faint fire attribute power. Angela glanced at them and didn&rsquo;t sense anything unusual. But when Agatha saw them, her eyes instantly widened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, her expression was incredibly excited. "What is this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "These are branches of the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore, which I obtained on Abyssal Planet during a zone duel. I think they might be useful to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne handed a Dimensional Bag to Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha had already activated the Dark Phoenix Bloodline and was likely the only Dark Phoenix in the cosmos. To any member of the Ember Phoenix Clan, these Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branches were extremely sacred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could help members of the Ember Phoenix Clan possess a purer, more powerful Phoenix Bloodline and enhance their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne obtained over ten thousand Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branches in the Magma Devourer's nest, and this Dimensional Bag contained two thousand of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was already enough for Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After absorbing these Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branches, Agatha's Dark Phoenix Bloodline would become purer and more powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha told herself in her heart, "I can't take anything more from Osborne. He's already given me too much. I don't know how to repay Osborne's kindness. Do I really have to repay him with my body?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, looking at the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branches, her breathing quickened, and she couldn't bring herself to say no.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her bloodline told her she needed these Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branches. Feeling the yearning in her bloodline, she trembled as she took the Dimensional Bag with both hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After opening the Dimensional Bag and seeing over two thousand Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branches inside, Agatha took a deep breath. Her body was trembling violently. Just one breath made her feel as if the power in her bloodline was boiling.</span></p></div>
