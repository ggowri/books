        <h1>Chapter 10 Confrontation</h1>
        <div><p>Soon, the video call was connected, revealing Justin&#x27;s handsome face.</p><p>Beside him stood a middle-aged man in his forties, with a bruised face and a terrified look.</p><p>Osborne frowned when he saw the middle-aged man.</p><p>This man was the owner of the store.</p><p>Justin looked calm. He smiled and said, &quot;Please repeat what you just told me. What on earth did that good-for-nothing Osborne do in your store?</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you dare lie, or you&#x27;ll end up dead.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ll tell. I&#x27;ll tell right away!&quot; The middle-aged shop owner was extremely scared.</p><p>He started to describe in detail how Osborne had used his tools and scrap items in the store to make the fake explosives with his own hands.</p><p>His account was so detailed that it didn&#x27;t seem fabricated at all.</p><p>After he finished, Justin looked at Ophelia with a smile.</p><p>&quot;Ophelia, you were so careless. You got tricked by a good-for-nothing with fake explosives!</p><p>&quot;If it weren&#x27;t for me, you would have cost the family 20 million dollars. You&#x27;ve made a huge mistake. I&#x27;ll report this to the Elder Council, and they&#x27;ll decide your punishment.&quot;</p><p>After Justin said that, he looked extremely smug.</p><p>He always thought he was the most outstanding descendant of the Caldwell family. He was handsome, graduated from a prestigious university, and was well-liked by the Elder Council.</p><p>Justin was once the most likely candidate to become the heir of the Caldwell family. But in the end, he lost the competition to Ophelia.</p><p>Today, as he learned that Ophelia&#x27;s ex-husband had extorted 20 million dollars in divorce compensation from the Caldwell family, he thought his chance to turn things around had come.</p><p>&quot;Ophelia, I&#x27;ve found out the truth. Why don&#x27;t you arrest that good-for-nothing right away?</p><p>&quot;Do you really want the family to lose 20 million dollars?</p><p>&quot;Are you even fit to be the heir?&quot; Justin scolded harshly.</p><p>Ophelia&#x27;s face darkened, looking extremely grim.</p><p>Justin wanted to report her to the Elder Council? And he dared to say she wasn&#x27;t fit to be the heir?</p><p>He was indeed full of evil intentions!</p><p>Ophelia said coldly, &quot;Justin, shut up! I know you&#x27;re trying to kill me through Osborne. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m stupid.&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, Justin was stunned.</p><p>Penelope quickly said, &quot;Justin, Osborne said you were deliberately deceiving us! He said it was your plot to use the explosives on him to kill us all.</p><p>&quot;Please tell everyone that&#x27;s not true, right?&quot;</p><p>Justin&#x27;s face turned gloomy. Once he grasped the situation, he couldn&#x27;t help but look at Osborne in shock.</p><p>&quot;Punk, you&#x27;re quite good at making excuses.&quot;</p><p>Osborne gave a faint smile. &quot;Whether I&#x27;m making excuses or not, you can find out by coming here yourself. Since the explosives on me are fake, why don&#x27;t you come and arrest me in person?&quot;</p><p>Justin frowned, his face getting even grimmer.</p><p>But seeing Ophelia staring at him intently, he sneered, &quot;You think I&#x27;m scared? Osborne, you know better than anyone that the explosives are fake. So stop putting on an act. Trying to extort money from the Caldwell family? You&#x27;re a dead man!&quot;</p><p>Osborne gave a smile. &quot;Really? Then come here and give it a shot. Let&#x27;s see if I won&#x27;t drag you to hell with me!&quot;</p><p>Looking at Osborne&#x27;s smile, Justin suddenly felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>This made him a bit unsure of himself.</p><p>He turned to the general-store owner, his face twisted with rage, and started beating the owner mercilessly.</p><p>&quot;Tell me, are the explosives real or fake?&quot;</p><p>The boss couldn&#x27;t bear the beating and cried out, &quot;Fake! They&#x27;re really fake!</p><p>The shop owner couldn&#x27;t bear the beating and cried out, &quot;Fake! They&#x27;re really fake! There&#x27;s no gunpowder in there, just sand. I even brought the sand to him myself. Please stop...&quot;</p><p>Osborne said with a faint smile, &quot;Stop hitting him. Justin, don&#x27;t blame me for looking down on you. You&#x27;re a coward! Even if you beat him to death and confirm what he said is true, you still won&#x27;t have the guts to face me!</p><p>&quot;If you dare to come here, I&#x27;ll blow you up!&quot;</p><p>Justin stopped, fuming with anger.</p><p>&quot;Damn it, what did you say? You, a good-for-nothing, dare to call me a coward?</p><p>&quot;And you say I&#x27;m afraid to face you?&quot;</p><p>Osborne ignored him and turned to Ophelia. &quot;Ophelia, do you remember the time three months ago when I suddenly overturned the dining table?&quot;</p><p>Ophelia was taken aback and nodded.</p><p>Three months ago, she and her stepmother Evelyn were about to have a meal when Osborne went crazy and flipped the table. She and Evelyn were furious and gave Osborne a good scolding.</p><p>Of course, she remembered it.</p><p>&quot;Osborne, why are you bringing this up all of a sudden? You&#x27;ve done so many stupid things over the years. This one isn&#x27;t anything special.&quot;</p><p>Osborne said indifferently, &quot;Oh, you stupid woman. You should thank me! If I hadn&#x27;t overturned your table, you&#x27;d have been poisoned to death by Justin!</p><p>&quot;Justin bribed your maid to put poison in your food. Because if you died, there&#x27;d be no one to compete with him for the heir position. But I saw through his plan.</p><p>&quot;Right, Justin?&quot;</p><p>Ophelia frowned tightly, not believing a word.</p><p>But Justin&#x27;s eyes widened in shock. So it was Osborne who had foiled his poisoning plan three months ago!</p><p>Justin hated Osborne to the core but didn&#x27;t dare to show it. He roared, &quot;Osborne, you good-for-nothing. How dare you frame me? Without any proof, do you think Ophelia is a fool? She&#x27;s my cousin. Why would I want to poison her?</p><p>&quot;Ophelia, he&#x27;s just trying to drive a wedge between us. You&#x27;re not going to fall for his tricks, are you?&quot;</p><p>Ophelia&#x27;s face was gloomy, and she said nothing.</p><p>Osborne smiled calmly and continued, &quot;Whether I&#x27;m trying to drive a wedge or not, Ophelia, you can send someone to investigate. You can start with that maid.&quot;</p><p>After he said that, Justin&#x27;s face paled.</p><p>Osborne added another blow. &quot;And one month ago, Justin sent his personal bodyguards to kill you. But again, I found out about it in advance.</p><p>&quot;I fought them in the dark, and you even scolded me for making noise and disturbing your rest.&quot;</p><p>Ophelia&#x27;s face hardened again.</p><p>She looked at Osborne in disbelief. &quot;What proof do you have for what you&#x27;re saying? And why didn&#x27;t you explain it back then?&quot;</p><p>Osborne shrugged. &quot;Do you believe me if I say I didn&#x27;t want you to worry?&quot;</p><p>Ophelia was stunned and bit her lip tightly.</p><p>&quot;As for the proof, that night I injured their arms. If you check, you&#x27;ll find out if any of Justin&#x27;s personal bodyguards had arm injuries a month ago. Then you&#x27;ll know the truth.&quot;</p><p>After Osborne finished speaking, Justin&#x27;s face turned red with anger.</p><p>He roared, &quot;Since it was a fight in the dark, how can you be sure they were my bodyguards? They couldn&#x27;t see you clearly, so how could you recognize them? You&#x27;re just slandering me!&quot;</p><p>Osborne looked at Justin contemptuously and didn&#x27;t bother to explain.</p><p>He just teased Ophelia, &quot;Ophelia, what&#x27;s your choice now? If you&#x27;re so sure the explosives are fake, come and end me!&quot;</p></div>
