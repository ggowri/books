        <h1>Chapter 2540 Escape</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, chaos was erupting on a resource-bearing planet at the edge of the cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Millions of people with Slave Brands on their faces were desperately fleeing for their lives. Behind them, thousands of warriors were relentlessly chasing, driving, and even slaughtering them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the fleeing crowd, someone shouted, "Let's run! Their mid- and high-level warriors are almost all dead. This is our best chance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another person echoed, "Let's hurry and escape. As long as we get out of here, we can shed our slave identity, no longer mining resources for them, starving, freezing, and getting beaten all the time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Others also shouted, "Let's run!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These millions were slaves bought by the Frenetic Storm Warband. They were controlled by the Frenetic Storm Warband, forced to mine resources for them. They did the hardest and most exhausting work, often facing danger. If they moved even a bit slower, they would be beaten and tortured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They originally didn&rsquo;t dare to resist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But not long ago, they received shocking news. The Soul Tokens of the mid- and high-level members of the Frenetic Storm Warband who left over a month ago had all shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This means they all died!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After those mid- and high-level members died, only some ordinary members of the Frenetic Storm Warband remained on this resource-bearing planet, including one warrior at advanced Empyrean Sacredness and several warriors at mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the news arrived, some slaves who weren&rsquo;t completely numb seemed to see a chance to change their fate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They chose to resist!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, a group of stronger slaves united, ambushed the remaining Frenetic Storm Warband overseers, unlocked their own shackles, and chose to flee for their lives.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, they also unlocked the shackles of all the other slaves, encouraging them to seize the chance to escape, creating chaos to make it harder for them to be recaptured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, chaos erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frenetic Storm Warband had thousands of members, most at the Supernal Deity King cultivation level, with only fifty reaching Empyrean Sacredness. However, most of them perished in the Phantomagic Realm. As a result, the remaining members were completely unable to control the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were powerless to capture the stronger slaves and could only try to retain as many slaves as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as they kept more slaves, they could continue mining the resource-bearing planet's resources. That way, they could gain wealth and eventually grow strong again someday.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Catch them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keep them all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't let them escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All of you stop. If anyone dares to run, we'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Beat them hard!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The members of the Frenetic Storm Warband shouted angrily. The slaves they captured were immediately beaten, some even to the point of being unable to move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the slaves are not strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to years of hard labor and torment, their bodies are extremely weak, making escape impossible. They were caught, beaten, and even killed outright.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The piercing screams echoed across the entire resource-bearing planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, all the warships of the Frenetic Storm Warband took off, sealing off the entire resource-bearing planet, preventing anyone from leaving. A few slaves had managed to escape, but most were still fleeing and hiding on the resource-bearing planet, hoping not to be found.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, a group of people was hiding in a canyon on the resource-bearing planet. There were over fifty of them, and most were very young.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leading them was a middle-aged man and woman. Through the trees in the canyon, they saw the sky blocked by the warships of the Frenetic Storm Warband, their faces filled with despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man, looking remorseful and heavy-hearted, said, "We missed our chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The sky is already sealed off. We can't escape now. We can only hide and hope not to be found. Once they give up searching for us, their defenses will surely loosen. Then, we'll have a chance to leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry. I couldn't lead everyone out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged woman beside him comforted, "Theodore, you've done very well. If it weren't for you, we would have been captured just now. At least we still have a chance now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others all comforted him. A man said, "Yes, Theodore, you've done very well. If it weren't for you taking care of those Frenetic Storm Warband pursuers, we would have been captured just now, or maybe even killed outright."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another person chimed in, "Theodore, we all believe in you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter what you say, we'll follow you. We believe you can lead us out. I've had enough of a life in slavery. This is our best chance. We must escape no matter what."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, I'd rather die here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of them weren't very strong, only at the Deity King Level or even Deity Overlord Level. Facing the pursuit of Frenetic Storm Warband warriors at the Supernal Deity King Level or even Empyrean Sacredness, they could only rely on Theodore and Vivienne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was because only the two of them were at the Supernal Deity King Level, and only they could confront the pursuers from the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at everyone's expectant eyes, Theodore felt a bit helpless, as the two of them were only at Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could confront the ordinary members of the Frenetic Storm Warband. But when facing true warriors, they were no match at all. How could they confidently lead everyone to escape?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, everyone believed in him, so he couldn't give up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theodore said, "Don't worry, everyone. We definitely have a chance. Right now, there are very few warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level on this resource-bearing planet. As long as we hide well, it will be hard for them to find us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Theodore's expression suddenly changed. "No! Someone's coming. Let's all suppress our presence."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Theodore dropped down and fully suppressed his presence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, many present failed to suppress their presence properly. The searchers' senses were extremely sharp, and they immediately noticed something unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, over a dozen members of the Frenetic Storm Warband appeared in the canyon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them laughed loudly and said, "A bunch of damn slaves are hiding here. These bastards dared to run away, making us search for them for so long. Now that we've found them, let's make sure they suffer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another chimed in, "Let's give them a good beating. Even if they die, they deserve it. We need to show them the consequences of rebellion and escape."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, over a dozen members of the Frenetic Storm Warband glared viciously at the fifty-plus slaves, their eyes filled with rage and killing intent, then quickly charged at them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theodore and Vivienne exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with helplessness and despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's fight. Even if we die, we refuse to remain slaves. If we can't escape this time, we might never have another chance. Kill them!" Theodore said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the two of them charged at the dozen Frenetic Storm Warband members. While attacking, they shouted, "Run! We'll hold them off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, the battle began instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theodore and Vivienne were both at Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King. However, among the dozen Frenetic Storm Warband members, several were warriors at Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King and Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King. Soon, they defeated Theodore and Vivienne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remaining fifty-plus people were also under their control.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone collapsed in the canyon, their eyes filled with despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So it was you two trying to lead them to escape? You both deserve to die." The leader of the Frenetic Storm Warband stared at Theodore and Vivienne, eyes full of killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the whip lashed harshly on their bodies. Instantly, terrifying wounds appeared on them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone shouted, "Beat them to death!"</span></p></div>
