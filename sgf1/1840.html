        <h1>Chapter 1839 The Arrogant Kurt</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales associate wore an apologetic expression, not looking down on Osborne but rather adhering to the store's rules regarding the verification of funds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Blue Planet, such practices weren't unusual, so Osborne understood completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The requirement of 100 thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals or one thousand Celestial Crystals was precisely the price for a Sanctum Level Light Airship. As for the Miracle Elixir, it likely didn't come cheap either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, Osborne wasn't particularly interested in either the Sanctum Level Light Airship or the Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already owned plenty of Supreme Malevolence Airships, and while the Sanctum Level ones were a bit stronger, they weren't significantly different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no need for him to buy another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His curiosity was merely piqued. As for the Miracle Elixir, he wouldn't waste his Essence Crystals on it. Even if Luminous Commerce Center had some, their stock would be limited, and he needed to gather more on his own from the divine peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, once he learned about the verification process, he decided to move on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were more pressing matters at hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget the verification, then. Can you take me to see the maps? I'm looking for a detailed map of Celestara, the more comprehensive, the better," Osborne said, shifting his focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate nodded in understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't think less of him for not having the funds for a Sanctum Level Light Airship; after all, only those Dukedom Level Powers could afford such luxury. Even First-rate Powers would have to scrape together every last crystal to make a purchase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was perfectly normal that Osborne couldn't present such a sum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a sales associate at the Luminous Commerce Center, she had encountered nearly all the bigwigs in Apocalypse City. Yet, she found herself completely unfamiliar with someone named Osborne. So, she surmised that Osborne probably wasn't a big shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to lead Osborne toward the map section, a mocking voice sliced through the air from behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! What are you trying to pull?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought I'd run into someone important! You want to gawk at Sanctum Level Light Airships and Miracle Elixirs? But as soon as they mention verification, you show your true colors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost and stop blocking my path!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a young man shoved past Osborne, a smug grin plastered on his face as he shot Osborne a disdainful glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Luminous Commerce Center was spacious enough, and there was no crowd, so this guy had plenty of room to pass without shoving him aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a deliberate provocation, and Osborne narrowed his eyes, sizing up the arrogant youth and the group trailing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man radiated arrogance, his demeanor suggesting he came from a privileged background. The few young men and women with him wore expressions of eager admiration, clearly fawning over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all at the Deity King level, with the front-runner already in the mid-stage of that realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "A group of young Deity Kings? They are definitely considered super talents! And the one in the lead, being in the mid-stage, is no small fry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the entire Paramount Supreme Clan, not many young ones reach mid-stage Deity King. Who is this guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man noticed Osborne still staring and shot him another glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you looking at? Don't you know your place, country bumpkin? Hurry up and get out of my way! If you keep bothering me while I'm shopping, I'll make sure you disappear from Apocalypse City forever. You believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, the followers behind him chimed in, adding their taunts and jeers, fueling the already tense atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear that? Mr. Kurt Baxter told you to get lost, so why are you still standing there?" one of the young followers sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Kurt Baxter is from the Baxter family! His father is one of the Supernal Deity Kings of the family!" another chimed in, eyes gleaming with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really want to test your luck, don't you?" a third added as they all rallied around Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Kurt Baxter, don't waste your time on this bumpkin! Only the Baxter family has the financial clout to buy a Sanctum Level Light Airship in Apocalypse City! Even the Hudson family can't match that anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy clearly doesn't know anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hurry and check out the Miracle Elixirs! I heard Luminous Commerce Center has stocked ten of them this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can only look, but Mr. Kurt Baxter can definitely snag a few or even all of them! With those, he'll be the top warrior among the young generation in Apocalypse City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all echoed, fawning over Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's chest swelled with pride. "Ha! I came here specifically for the Miracle Elixirs! With those ten, I'll have a real shot at breaking into the late Deity King stage! Even if I don't make it, my power will skyrocket!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one in the younger generation of Apocalypse City will stand a chance against me! I'll crush those Hudson family losers without breaking a sweat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The entire younger generation of the Human Community in West Zone won't have many who can match me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm definitely locking down those ten Miracle Elixirs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, Kurt strutted away, his arrogance palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't bother to look back at someone like Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Kurt was out of sight, Osborne rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So his name is Kurt Baxter? The super genius of the Baxter family? I wonder who his father is. Could it be... the Supernal Deity King who has the Hammer of Thor? They do bear a striking resemblance!"</span></p></div>
