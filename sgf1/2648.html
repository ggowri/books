        <h1>Chapter 2533 Slaughter-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of thousands of Empyrean Sacredness warriors might sound like a vast number, but before Dalia's hundreds of terrifying tentacles, they stood no chance. They were slaughtered in waves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They screamed and begged desperately, but it was all in vain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could only attack the Phantomagic Realm with all their might. The Phantomagic Realm became even more shattered, but they could never completely destroy it. Their eyes gradually filled with despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne stood inside Drum's Dimensional Microcosm. Watching Dalia's frenzied slaughter outside, his expression was grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, is it really safe here?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum stood on Osborne's left shoulder, nodded firmly, and said confidently, "Dad, don't worry, this monster can't find us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne completely relaxed after hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew that without Drum, he would surely be like those outside, helplessly waiting for death, watching those tentacles pierce his body and drain every drop of blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm still too weak! My cultivation level is too low! If I were an advanced Empyrean Sacredness now... even if I still couldn't defeat Dalia at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level, I could definitely put up a fight!" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, at least I could break this damn Phantomagic Realm!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne bit his lip tightly. At this moment, he longed to become stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Osborne had already reached the limit of Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King. As long as he wished, he could break through his cultivation level at any time and become an Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he still remembered Adriana's reminder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All participants in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel would be led by the Glorious Divine Kingdom to a mysterious place called Necropolis City. And only those below Empyrean Sacredness could enter its core area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before going to Necropolis City, I must suppress the breakthrough of my cultivation level! I must destroy his past life's father, the Glorious Divine Emperor's plan in Necropolis City. I can't let the Glorious Divine Emperor gain power in Necropolis City and break through to become a true Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, I can forget about avenging myself in this lifetime!" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne suppressed the idea of immediately breaking through to become an Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew that even if he broke through to Empyrean Sacredness, he would only reach primary Empyrean Sacredness. Even if his strength improved, he definitely wouldn't be a match for Dalia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching the massacre outside, Osborne felt a wave of helplessness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew he couldn't change anything, so he simply stopped watching. He began checking the condition of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier, while seizing the last nine Bewitching Lanterns, the Warfare Ancient Tree was struck by Dalia's tentacles and suffered significant injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, its aura only weakened without any fundamental damage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, there were a total of ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns hanging on the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Bewitching Lanterns seemed to be undergoing some kind of change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, you're in luck!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "These ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns have absorbed almost all the power of the Phantomagic Realm. The Phantomagic Realm will never appear again! And these ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns have thus gained the power to evolve into an Imperial Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, they will merge and transform on the Warfare Ancient Tree! It won't take long before they fully merge and evolve into a true Imperial Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel a bit excited after hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally heard some good news. Those ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns, each one was a Legendary Sacred Artifact. But that was before absorbing the power of the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After absorbing the power of the Phantomagic Realm, they can all evolve into Supreme Sacred Artifacts. If they eventually merge together, they will become a true Imperial Artifact!</span></p></div>
