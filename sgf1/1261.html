        <h1>Chapter 1260 Rachel Deschanel</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We welcome the awakening of our forebears!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tens of thousands of Deschanel family members echoed with fervor and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their chants resonated through the hallowed halls as the sixty-three Sanctuary Caskets began to quake, some more intensely than others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, thirty-five of these caskets erupted with force, their lids sliding off abruptly. From each emerged a figure, each exuding an overwhelming aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very ground trembled beneath the sanctuary as a swirling tornado of power raged, subsiding only after a long, tense moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hail, esteemed elders!" Joseph proclaimed, bowing deeply to the thirty-five awakened souls, relief evident in his visage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders acknowledged Joseph with a nod, their status clearly on par with his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their prowess was undeniable: the least formidable of these newly roused deities stood at the rank of Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the towering figures at the rear, five radiated an intensity that stronger Joseph's&mdash;eyes as sharp as blades, daunting even to the bravest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This quintet of warriors bore the title of Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five Transcendent Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty Superior Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan was electrified, their ancestral strength a beacon of invincibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Joseph Deschanel, your efforts have been commendable. Now, hand the reins to me," declared a warrior from the newly awakened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a woman seemingly in her mid-thirties, her presence commanding silence and respect, including from Joseph himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Rachel Deschanel, your awakening dictates our course. The Deschanel Clan henceforth adheres to your every instruction," Joseph hastily responded, bowing once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then surveyed the tens of thousands, her gaze cold, devoid of warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These kin of ours... their strength is lacking, almost dispensable. Yet, being descendants of Terrence, they merit better than to be mere fodder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clan members shifted uneasily, but Rachel paid them no heed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her scrutiny to Joseph. "Explain. With our Sanctuary Caskets, our recovery is twice as swift. What led to such grievous losses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph recounted the events, punctuated by Rachel's mounting fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pantheon League? </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization? How dare they provoke the Deschanel Clan for dominion over this new world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their days are numbered! Produce their coordinates; I shall eradicate them </span><span>forthwith!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's hesitation was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's amiss? Or do you question my authority?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel's glare pierced Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hesitation evaporated. "No, Ms. Rachel Deschanel. We merely... can't take down the Pantheon League and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization directly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel's brow furrowed. "Why so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph said, "Their whereabouts remain elusive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ever since our last battle with the Pantheon League, they've vanished without a trace! No one knows where they're hiding! We've sent people to search, but it's like they've vanished in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, they're even more elusive. We've been investigating them for ages, and we're no closer to finding their location now than we were then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel's brow furrowed again. "Can't find them, huh? Tch, a bunch of incompetents!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then send more people! Our recovery speed is far superior to theirs. The advantage is ours, but we're wasting it because we can't pinpoint their locations?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to find them, and fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't forget about the Court of the Sun and the Prophet Alliance&mdash;find them too, and wipe them off the map while we're at it! Once they're gone, this new world is ours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A resolute gleam flashed in Rachel's eyes as she spoke, her determination unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph hurriedly responded, "Understood! We'll throw everything we've got into the search. But... I have to say, this won't be easy. If we can't find them, what then? Do we just sit around and wait?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel snorted coldly, "Sit around? Don't be ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our goal is to rule this world, and if they want to hide, then so be it. We'll use this time to our advantage. We'll enslave every superpower on this planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who bow to the Deschanel Clan will live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who refuse will die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's start with </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. We'll cleanse the entire region of any superpower that dares defy us!"</span></p></div>
