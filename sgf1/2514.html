        <h1>Chapter 2415 Rescue</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Leroy and Clara's faces were deathly pale, their eyes filled with despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, they had previously encountered numerous attacks from Abyssal Snakes and Bloody Ivy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at that time, hundreds of contestants were gathered together. Everyone joined forces and eventually broke through, forcing their way out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, the two of them were left at the very back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not to mention the aura of the Magma Devourer getting closer, just the Abyssal Snakes and Bloody Ivy alone were beyond what they could handle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy!" Clara gritted her teeth and said, "Put me down right now and run for your life. In this situation, there's no way both of us can survive. If you leave me, I'll distract them for you. That way, you might make it out alive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Leroy bit his lip tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His heart was filled with struggle, thinking, "Clara is right. With Clara unable to move, there's no way I can break through. We'll definitely be killed by those Abyssal Snakes and Bloody Ivy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I leave Clara behind, I might still have a chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But I don't want to do that. Just now, if it weren't for Clara, I would have been the one bitten by the Abyssal Snake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara is my savior. How can I leave Clara behind, let her distract the enemies, and escape alone? I can't do it. I can't convince myself to do that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Leroy gripped the Inferno Drake Lance tightly, unleashing his Sacred Power wildly to protect himself and Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gritted her teeth and said, "Stop talking. I won't leave you behind to escape alone. If we live, we live together. If we die, we die here together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Clara felt both extremely anxious and deeply moved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, many people had been bitten by the Abyssal Snake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, no matter how desperately they begged for help or promised various benefits, hoping someone would take them along to escape and not abandon them, no one saved them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was in danger. Who would be willing to spend extra effort bringing along someone who couldn't move?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, knowing Leroy was unwilling to leave her behind and escape alone, Clara was truly moved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No time to think further, Clara saw the Abyssal Snake and Bloody Ivy in the distance burrow into the desert and disappear. Instantly, she knew they were coming and shouted, "Be careful. They're coming!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They like to suddenly emerge from the sand and launch sneak attacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Be careful!" Clara couldn't use Sacred Power now and could do nothing but pray for Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said nothing, remaining extremely alert.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Leroy sensed something unusual behind him and thrust the Inferno Drake Lance. Instantly, he pierced through the head of an Abyssal Snake just emerging.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Abyssal Snake twisted, hissing angrily. Eventually, its body stiffened and it died.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, more Abyssal Snakes rushed out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy was surrounded by Abyssal Snakes on all sides. They opened their ferocious jaws, revealing razor-sharp, eerily glowing blue fangs, and lunged fiercely at Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, more Bloody Ivy emerged. They twisted relentlessly, quickly entangling Leroy's Inferno Drake Lance. Their immense strength caused Leroy to stagger. She could only watch as the Abyssal Snakes lunged at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm going to die!" At this moment, Leroy was utterly desperate. How could she possibly handle so many Abyssal Snakes and Bloody Ivy alone?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt death approaching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, an arrow suddenly appeared in front of Leroy and then exploded. In an instant, all the Abyssal Snakes lunging at her were torn apart by the force of the explosion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the force of the explosion didn't harm Leroy or Clara at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such powerful control over strength left Leroy stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes showed shock and delight as she quickly looked in the direction the arrow appeared. "Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rode on Flash's back, swiftly pursuing the Magma Devourer. Shortly after, he discovered several contestants' corpses and immediately became very serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could tell that these contestants weren't killed by the Magma Devourer but by other native creatures on the Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the corpses bore snake bite marks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It's the Abyssal Snake and Bloody Ivy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye and saw numerous traces left by Abyssal Snake and Bloody Ivy in the desert, along with signs of contestants fleeing in panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This desert area has the most contestants. Leroy and Clara are also searching for Bloody Ivy in the desert. It seems they've already gathered and are fleeing together. But Abyssal Snake and Bloody Ivy are hunting them. I can only hope Clara and Leroy are safe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued forward and soon saw the Magma Devourer along with Gerald and other judges fighting it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They really aren't a match for the Magma Devourer," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Magma Devourer's defense was terrifying. Even hundreds of judges working together couldn't stop it, and judges kept getting killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "This group can't kill the Magma Devourer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I can't kill it now either. The Magma Devourer is still at its peak. Even if I find its weakness, I can't take it down. I'll leave it for now. I need to save Leroy and Clara first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very worried about them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After encountering so many contestants' corpses along the way, Osborne knew Leroy and Clara were in terrible danger. Fortunately, he hadn't found their bodies yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, let's go around," Osborne ordered Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Flash was staring at the distant Magma Devourer. Osborne could feel the fighting spirit on Flash's face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed to want to fight the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This discovery shocked Osborne. He thought, "The Magma Devourer is so strong. But Flash isn't afraid and even wants to fight it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash had just broken through to Empyrean Sacredness, only at the primary Empyrean Sacredness level. Meanwhile, the Magma Devourer was already at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, nearly reaching the Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Flash, don't rush. We'll fight the Magma Devourer later. For now, we need to rescue people first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Osborne's command, Flash finally looked away and withdrew its fighting spirit. It quickly unleashed its full speed, bypassed the Magma Devourer, and continued chasing ahead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The farther Osborne went, the more bodies he found, and the more worried he became.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are many Bloody Ivy and Abyssal Snake in this desert. They seem to be acting on the Magma Devourer's orders to block and hunt down the contestants," Osborne thought, quickly making a judgment in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, his expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used Satan's Eye to spot Leroy and Clara from afar, but their situation was extremely dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't have time to think much. He quickly took out the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow and drew the string.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, an arrow imbued with Sacred Power shot out.</span></p></div>
