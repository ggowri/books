        <h1>Chapter 2518 Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, their speed in killing Illusionary Heavenly Demons and obtaining Legendary Dragon Elixir increased at least threefold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just three days, Osborne obtained another hundred drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, the quantity of Legendary Dragon Elixir reached two hundred drops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne noticed a group of smaller meteorite bodies ahead, numbering only about a hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the aura of these meteorite bodies was Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Illusionary Heavenly Demons of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was shocked to find that there were actually Illusionary Heavenly Demons of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection in the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly thought, "If the Illusionary Heavenly Demons of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection are killed, would the Dragon Elixir they condense be even stronger than the Legendary Dragon Elixir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael said the highest quality of Dragon Elixir is Legendary, and he has never seen anything beyond Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps it's because no one has ever obtained a higher-level Dragon Elixir! After all, to get a Dragon Elixir, one must kill a thousand Illusionary Heavenly Demons! And among those who enter the Phantomagic Realm, very few are capable of killing a thousand Illusionary Heavenly Demons of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Phantomagic Realm only exists for one month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To kill a thousand Illusionary Heavenly Demons of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection within a month..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that it was very difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most important thing is that Illusionary Heavenly Demons always appear in groups. Although there aren't many Illusionary Heavenly Demons of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, there are still about a hundred of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior wouldn't dare provoke them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It would take at least several Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors working together to dare make a move against them. But Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors are already rare, and forces with several of them likely wouldn't even be interested in the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne hesitated, wondering whether to provoke these Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his and Flash's strength, if they were facing a single Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demon, they could completely take it down. Osborne's Heaven Arrow could definitely severely injure or even kill it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when a hundred Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons gather together, that's trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne and Flash fall into their siege, they could both die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Should I give it a try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons contain a denser Demon Dragon's Breath! Once they form a Dragon Elixir, its effect will surely surpass a Legendary Dragon Elixir!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was somewhat tempted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I'll give it my all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, Osborne is now trapped in an independent illusionary space and has no way to search for the Frenetic Storm Warband. Instead of wasting time, he might as well give it a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the worst-case scenario, with his spatial power, he can completely escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even if he wants to act, he can't be impulsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and Flash must change their strategy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Flash can no longer stand at the front to absorb attacks. After all, he can't withstand the attacks of a hundred Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'll be killed instantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne and Flash can only attack from a distance. Once some Illusionary Heavenly Demons are killed, they retreat and then slowly deal with the rest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking it through, Osborne immediately drew his bowstring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Heaven Arrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting ready, Osborne had Flash charge forward to activate those Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons. Before they could attack, Osborne released the bowstring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying Heaven Arrow shot out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the leading Illusionary Heavenly Demon was killed by the Heaven Arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Success!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was pleasantly surprised. His strongest move, Heaven Arrow, could indeed kill Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Illusionary Heavenly Demons have no Defensive Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their defense is much weaker than Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors. It's normal that they can't withstand the Heaven Arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, after being used once, the Heaven Arrow enters a half-hour cooldown time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne wants to use it again, he must wait for this time to end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without the Heaven Arrow, if he wants to continue killing these Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons, it will be difficult!</span></p></div>
