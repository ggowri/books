        <h1>Chapter 2717 Frederick's Trump Card</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista was on the verge of losing it. Watching Weston launch a frenzied attack on her, with a desperate expression to kill her, she felt both sadness and anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All of this was because of Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista believed it must be him using some strange means to control Weston; otherwise, her proudest son would never attack her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she hated Osborne to the core.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she could do nothing about him, as she was already struggling to fend off Weston's attacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she, like Weston, was a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, she was slightly weaker than him. Moreover, his attacks were full force, while she didn&rsquo;t want to hurt him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So naturally, Callista was at an absolute disadvantage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this continued, she would inevitably be defeated by Weston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne watched all this, unable to help but sneer, feeling immensely satisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista was being attacked by her own son, and she must be feeling very upset. This was also why Osborne didn&rsquo;t use the Apocalypse Bow to deal with her directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just wanted to make her suffer!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, the reason he didn&rsquo;t use the Apocalypse Bow was also that he felt something was off. The situation had completely turned around. Whether in terms of the number of warriors or their strength, their side had already surpassed Frederick&rsquo;s.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Frederick didn&rsquo;t panic at all and continued fighting Adriana calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Osborne fall into deep thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Could Emperor Frederick still have a trump card? What could it be?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn&rsquo;t guess the answer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So he didn&rsquo;t use the Apocalypse Bow right away, deciding to keep it as a trump card to avoid any surprises.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even without the Apocalypse Bow, Osborne's strength was still terrifying. Apart from Frederick and Callista, the two Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, no other enemies were taken seriously by Osborne at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took out the Bloodwrought Bow, repeatedly drawing it and firing Sacred Power Arrows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow, Arrow Storm!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t use the Heaven Arrow, still keeping it as a trump card. After all, the Heaven Arrow also has a cooldown time. It would take him at least three minutes to use it again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the Earth Arrow was already enough for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even someone like Quinn, a Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, couldn&rsquo;t withstand Osborne&rsquo;s Earth Arrow&rsquo;s Arrow Storm. Naturally, most of the enemies present couldn&rsquo;t either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the Arrow Storm, a Royal Family Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior was hit, his defense instantly torn apart by the Sacred Power Arrow. His body was pierced, causing severe injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the Dragon Binding Rope directly bound his severely injured body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Drum took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>None of the enemies present could see or touch her, yet she could extract the Soulbane Parasite from the Soul Current Ocean of that Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior and quickly take control of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, Osborne controlled another enemy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this situation, his numbers increased while Frederick's decreased. The scales of victory quickly tipped in Osborne's favor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne still didn't relax.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bad feeling in his heart grew even stronger because, even in such a dire situation, Frederick remained calm and unperturbed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "He definitely has a trump card!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could he still have reinforcements?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked grim, pushing his Satan's Eye to the limit. He scanned the surroundings but found nothing unusual. Within millions of miles, there were no Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "That's strange. Why can Emperor Frederick stay so calm?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Never mind. I'll finish this battle quickly! No matter what trump card he has, once I deal with all his reinforcements, he'll reveal himself!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He attacked again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's cultivation level was the lowest among everyone present. After all, he was the only Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior, while all the others were Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in terms of strength, he was definitely the strongest apart from Frederick, Adriana, Callista, and Weston, the four Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he used the Apocalypse Bow, even Callista and Weston would be instantly defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Osborne didn&rsquo;t use the Apocalypse Bow and only wielded the Bloodwrought Bow, he could still defeat any Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors with the Earth Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such circumstances, he achieved tremendous results.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors he defeated had reached four.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among these four, two were controlled by Drum using the Soulbane Parasite, further strengthening their side's power while weakening Frederick's side even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, the number of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors still capable of fighting on both sides had dropped to less than forty. Among them, Osborne's side had twenty-four, while Frederick's side was left with only fourteen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The outcome of the battle was completely clear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana looked at Frederick, fighting him while sneering, "Emperor Frederick, you have already lost!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have no chance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick snorted coldly, "I never thought I would be pushed to this extent by you! I thought I could control everything, thought that on the Racial Convergence Planet, no one could threaten me anymore. Yet, you&rsquo;ve nearly driven me to the brink!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, I said that the ultimate victor would still be me! Originally, I didn&rsquo;t want to reveal my true trump card, but since it&rsquo;s come to this, I won&rsquo;t hide it anymore..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, let me show you my true trump card!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick suddenly waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a massive space rift appeared beside him, emanating a terrifying power that instantly put Adriana on alert.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The true trump card?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, be careful!" Adriana shouted loudly, staring gravely at the space rift.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also looked over at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick, you finally can't resist using your trump card? Then let me see what it is!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was curious too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick shouted, "Come out, all of you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, figures began to emerge from the massive space rift. Their power was immense, each reaching the level of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, the aura of two individuals even made Osborne feel they were not much weaker than Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, more than sixty people emerged from the space rift. They were all Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors. This instantly left Adriana stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne couldn't help but be stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Sixty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors? How is this possible?! How could Emperor Frederick still have such a hidden trump card?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression became extremely grave. Among the sixty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, two were Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, and there were more than ten Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they joined the battle, the outcome would change instantly. Osborne and his companions wouldn't stand a chance against them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, that's sixty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, the number of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors still able to fight on Frederick's side reached seventy-four.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Osborne's side only had twenty-four!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gap was too huge!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick burst into laughter, "How about it? Does my trump card surprise you? Now, you're doomed!"</span></p></div>
