        <h1>Chapter 725 The End of the War</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma noticed the shift in Osborne's expression and quickly asked, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne replied, "The war is over! Everyone from the Aberrants pulled out of Rosmandi last night&mdash;every single one of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's eyes widened in surprise. "Is it really over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked a bit lost. "This whole war feels strange. The Aberrants came in strong, and yet they only managed to occupy the six coastal provinces in the south of Rosmandi. They barely took any rare metal mines and didn't even attack the provincial headquarters. And now, it's just... done?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to her, Osborne understood the true nature of the Aberrants' retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had achieved their goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd acquired enough of the Divine Bone Crystals, and once they returned to their lair, they could spend some time cloning more powerful Evolved Humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they might even produce Class S Evolved Humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When that happened, the Aberrants would surely launch another assault on the Augustine family, and the next war would be a matter of life and death for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took another deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I just hope Godfather's plans go smoothly. Whether it's retrieving the Divine Bone Crystals or the ancient deity's remains, we need to thwart the King of the Aberrants' plans!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if all else fails, Godfather must come back safely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, trying to push the thoughts away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, he was only Class AA. Osborne had no place in a battle of that magnitude, and worrying too much wouldn't help anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's definitely over. Maybe this time the Aberrants just wanted to test the waters," Osborne said, keeping the details about the Divine Bone Crystals to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma nodded. "I think you're right! But hey, it's over, so let's check the leaderboard. I want to see where we stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I drop out of the top two, I'll have to give up the divine artifact, the swallow shield!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of worry crossed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly glanced at the leaderboard and then broke into a smile. "Don't worry, you're still in second place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rankings hadn't changed much from the day before. Osborne remained in first place, with a significant lead over the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma, having taken down two Class AAA Evolved Humans yesterday, had gained two thousand points, putting her ahead of Matthew by a solid one hundred fifty points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen trailed Matthew by just three hundred points, sitting in fourth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the rules for selecting heirs, the top three, Osborne, Emma, and Matthew, would become the heirs of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was the first heir, and as long as nothing unexpected happened, he would surely become the future head of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If something did happen to him, then Emma would take his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew! I managed to hold onto second place!" Emma exclaimed, clearly relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had long since given up hope of claiming first, and to be honest, she wasn't even that interested in becoming the head of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason Emma was fighting for the second was to keep the swallow shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled at Osborne, "Thank goodness Vincent was too aggressive and got injured, dropping out of the selection. Otherwise, I might not have made it to second!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Osborne, now that you're the first heir of the Augustine family, are you excited?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was genuinely thrilled, but not just because he had become the top heir of the Augustine family. His excitement stemmed from finally completing the sixth trial to become the Godfather's heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he had the authority to send Anastasia to the Godfather's medical research lab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's mysterious illness couldn't wait any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope the Godfather's lab can cure Anastasia's condition," Osborne thought, filled with both hope and anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, both Osborne and Emma's Draco Star Wristlets buzzed with a new directive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma glanced at her wristlet, her expression shifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's an order from the Godfather! He wants us to assemble at the headquarters in Dampston immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "An order from the Godfather? But didn't he sneak off to the Aberrants? Why would he issue a directive now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not dwelling on it too long, Osborne nodded. "Alright, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma nodded back and reached out to take Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body tensed slightly at the unexpected touch, but he didn't protest. He grasped her hand in return and tore open a dimensional rift, stepping through it with Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few hours later, they arrived back in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draco Group headquarters, once under Osborne's control, was now bustling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, Owen, and Lance had already arrived with their teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was about to enter, his Draco Star Wristlet buzzed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations on completing the sixth trial! Rewards are now being distributed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p></div>
