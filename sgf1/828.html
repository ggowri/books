        <h1>Chapter 828 The Confrontation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What did you just say?" Clarissa shouted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice was as cold as the arctic wind, and she clenched her fists tightly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's smile was barely there. "What's this? Are you excited now? I said, my brother has taken a liking to you! I'm here to escort you to Marcelin. He's prepared a grand wedding in your honor.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me enlighten you. Women vying to marry my brother could form a line from Rosmandi to Marcelin! Even princesses and daughters of superpowers dream of becoming his bride.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's quite the honor for you to be chosen by my brother."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Ebony delivered her statement, her face glowed with unmistakable pride.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa turned as frigid as frost and let out a disdainful snort.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your name is Ebony, right? You must be delusional. Go find someone else who's interested in marrying your brother! Who he fancies is his business, not mine!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want nothing to do with your Thornberry family, and I have zero interest in marrying your brother!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, please leave!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony was taken aback and raised her voice in disbelief, "You're refusing? Do you understand the gravity of your decision?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's reply was as cold as the winter frost, "I'll say it again. Leave, now!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's face hardened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From her being erupted a formidable and terrifying aura that instantly pressed down upon Clarissa with palpable intensity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa gaped in shock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Class AAA?" she whispered.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stepping in front of Donna and the others, she shielded them from Ebony's oppressive might.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony haughtily declared, "You're so fortunate that my brother has feelings for you! How dare you refuse? You're courting death!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As the heir of the Thornberry family, my brother has never been rejected! Not in Marcelin, and certainly not in Rosmandi!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I invited you politely, and you refused. Then don't blame me for taking you by force!" Ebony declared.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hand signaled her subordinates.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take her! She's the Fatebearer, crucial for my brother's advancement to Class S. We must have her, no matter the cost. If she resists, subdue her!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At her command, the men in black swiftly encircled Clarissa. Their auras flared, revealing their prowess. A wave of shock began to seep into Clarissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These men clad in black were no ordinary enforcers but masters; each one boasted strength above Class A, with two among them having ascended to the formidable ranks of Class AA.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These men, AA-class masters, were acting as mere bodyguards for Ebony? The Thornberry family's influence was staggering.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa was shocked. Yet, fear did not quell her resolve to refuse Ebony. Her heart belonged to Osborne alone, so she would never yield to another's affection.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aunt Donna, father, please go back!" Clarissa called out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her gaze locked onto Ebony with a cold determination. "You want me to go to Marcelin with you, right? Then try and make me! Let's see if you can drag my body there!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After her declaration, Clarissa unleashed her own aura.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony looked stern as she shouted, "How stubborn! You'd rather die than come with me to marry my brother? Very well! You've angered me!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But with your mere AA-class strength, you're not even fit to die before me! I forgot to mention that I rank 398th on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Though my ranking isn't high, it's more than enough to defeat you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those words, she flicked her wrist dismissively as she commanded, "Go on! Seize her!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, over a dozen men in black launched their attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were all masters, each ranking above Class A, with two among them even achieving the formidable Class AA. Together, they surged towards Clarissa, painting a fearsome spectacle that would chill anyone to the bone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Clarissa remained unshaken.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Behind her, the Divine and Demonic Wings unfurled, encasing her in a protective cocoon. The onslaught of the men in black was met with the unyielding barrier of the wings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Divine and Demonic Wings flapped with a strength that sent over a dozen men in black flying, even the two AA-class masters unable to withstand the force. They were hurled away, blood painting the air.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In mere moments, the men in black lay defeated.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's surprise was evident. "Impressive. You're only at Class AA, yet you wield such power. You are indeed worthy of my brother.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But your strength, though commendable, is still not enough against me!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony sprang into action with a decisive swiftness.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Solar Realm!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Buzz!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air around the Radcliffe Estate was suddenly charged with a terrifying force. Ten suns appeared in the sky. Their scorching breath was focused solely on Clarissa, causing her Divine and Demonic Wings to crackle ominously under the strain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's face paled.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Realm!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's smile was chilling. "Within my realm, I am omnipotent. You'd do well to submit."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a wave of her hand, the ten suns blazed even terrifyingly brighter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Divine and Demonic Wings shattered under the relentless assault, and the force slammed into Clarissa's body with the fury of a tempest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa coughed up a mouthful of blood.</p></div>
