        <h1>Chapter 1590 Preparing to Depart</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took the Malevolence Shield from Hannah, and before he knew it, she suddenly threw her arms around him. He froze, caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hesitated for a moment but ultimately didn't push her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pushing her away would just hurt her too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew exactly how Hannah felt about him&mdash;she had made it more than clear. But there was no way he could accept her feelings. Not when he already had Isa, Clarissa, Emma, and Austin. Even without them...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could never picture himself marrying into the Gellar family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For someone from the Mystic Feather Clan like Hannah, even just bringing in a member of the Human Community was a big enough deal. Hoping they'd let her marry him outright? No way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, for now, all he could be was her friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, Osborne gently patted her back, giving her a reassuring smile. "Alright, that's enough. You don't need to worry so much about me. What, are you doubting my abilities now? I might not be at your level yet, but if we fought, I bet I'd surprise you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah finally let go of him, her eyes a bit misty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gave him a scolding look. "I know how strong you are! But Divine Peak Nine isn't like anything you've faced before. Even Deity Kings have died up there&mdash;four of them! And Deity Overlords? There have been hundreds who didn't make it. Celestial Deities are basically just cannon fodder..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, worry crept back onto her face, and she looked like she was about to try to convince him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a headache coming on and quickly switched topics. "Alright, alright, let's not talk about that. By the way, it looks like you're close to breaking through to Deity Overlord, aren't you? So young and already hitting that level&mdash;that's really something to be proud of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words successfully shifted Hannah's focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A proud smile spread across her face. "Of course! I am the Mystic Feather Clan's super genius, after all. You better keep up&mdash;you don't want me leaving you behind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They chatted for a while longer before Hannah finally left, though not without making Osborne promise to contact her every two days. If he didn't, she warned, she'd sneak off to Divine Peak Nine herself just to find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no choice but to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Osborne returned to the Wild Flame Army camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy, the leader of ten thousand, saw Osborne and bowed respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked, "Guy, how's the fight between the Borden family and the Saxton family going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy responded calmly, "The conflict's only getting more intense. The Borden family's taken some heavy losses, and everyone's furious. They're swearing they'll strike back even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like this isn't ending anytime soon unless one side gives in or some much stronger power intervenes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, a satisfied smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once I'm at Divine Peak Nine, I'm leaving this to you and Murray. Don't let them make peace easily. If you see any sign of that, stir things up&mdash;make sure this drags out as long as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, my lord."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over the next two days, Osborne didn't leave the Wild Flame Army camp. He stayed put, focusing on his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could feel his space power essence was on the verge of breaking through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Going from level six peak to level seven with a power essence was a massive leap. Those who managed it were considered exceptional talents, and most only did so after advancing to Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, though, was still in the early Celestial Deity stage, yet his space power essence was already approaching level seven. If people heard that, they probably wouldn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lately, Osborne had felt multiple times that his space power essence was about to break through. But every time he focused on it, something seemed to be missing&mdash;he could never quite push it over the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was starting to frustrate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Divine Peak Nine's dangers are probably beyond what anyone can imagine. Otherwise, so many people wouldn't fear it. Even Deity Kings have fallen there. With my current strength, I'm sure I'll face plenty of danger too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I can break through to level seven with my space power essence, my ability to protect myself will be much stronger. The risk will be reduced, and I'll have a better chance of collecting death scent liquid at Divine Peak Nine&mdash;or even finding other treasures!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Things like Ultimate Essence Crystals, Celestial Crystals, or maybe even some kind of "technology." It's a shame, though&mdash;I've tried so many times, but I just can't break through to level seven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned, feeling the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Departure for Divine Peak Nine was approaching fast, and his space power essence still refused to cooperate. He was growing anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Should I use a core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity? I've got four left, and I'm pretty sure that using one would let me break through immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But... it feels like such a waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I can already sense the bottleneck. Even without using core energy, I know I'll break through eventually&mdash;it's just a matter of time. Using one now would be overkill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne decided against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll wait and see. If I hit an unavoidable danger, I can use the core energy then to push through."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, the day to leave for Divine Peak Nine finally arrived.</span></p></div>
