        <h1>Chapter 2524 Interrogation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Hamilton immediately felt a chill all over and looked at Osborne with some anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne really wasn't here to help him, but Hamilton felt very puzzled at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Osborne was here to cause trouble for him, but he didn't know Osborne at all and couldn't figure out why Osborne killed Trenton, Dominic, and Ronald first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you?" Hamilton couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly and said, "You'll soon know who I am. But for now, you'd better surrender immediately. Otherwise, I don't mind letting you feel what pain truly means."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne's eyes were filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's heart was filled only with hatred for Hamilton. After all, his parents were sold to the Frenetic Storm Warband. Over these twenty-plus years, even if they were still alive, they would surely have been enslaved and constantly beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for needing more information from Hamilton, Osborne would have wanted to kill him right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Surrender?" A hint of madness flashed in Hamilton's eyes as he gritted his teeth and said, "You want me to surrender? You're dreaming. I may not know who you are, but if you want to go against me, I'll make you pay the price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill him!" Hamilton suddenly ordered, then, along with the remaining five warriors at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, charged at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered and said, "You're courting death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If these people were all at their peak, Osborne might have been more cautious. In fact, even if he teamed up with Flash, they might not be a match for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, due to burning their blood essence, these people were now in a weakened state, with their strength at most only 30% of their peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was not afraid of them at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne and Flash began to act. "Flash, don't kill anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne took the initiative to charge at Hamilton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, Osborne didn't use the Bloodwrought Bow. He didn't want to kill Hamilton, but just wanted to defeat him and then control him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne chose close combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his hand appeared a pitch-black scythe, taller than his body and incredibly menacing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's the Warfare Scythe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instantly appeared in front of Hamilton and directly slashed through Hamilton's defense with the Warfare Scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, with the sharp Warfare Scythe, Hamilton's protective shield seemed nonexistent, easily sliced open by Osborne. Then, a gruesome wound was left on Hamilton's body, with blood continuously flowing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!" Hamilton let out a painful scream. Immediately, he summoned a terrifying power and fiercely attacked Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasn't afraid at all. His other hand gripped a shield shaped like a swallowtail. That&rsquo;s the Warfare Shield!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, all of Hamilton's attacks landed on the Warfare Mist released by the Warfare Shield. His attack only forced Osborne to take a step back, without causing him any harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne struck again with the Warfare Scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Hamilton let out another piercing scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Sacred Power had an extremely terrifying corrosive effect. This corrosion on Hamilton made his pain even more unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his face was already contorted, and his body was trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Waves of weakness left Hamilton feeling powerless. Although Hamilton clearly sensed that Osborne's strength was inferior to his, he simply couldn't defeat Osborne and was instead repeatedly injured by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne avoided Hamilton's vital spots, as if venting his anger, continuously slicing at Hamilton's body. Hamilton was nearly driven mad but grew weaker and weaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't beat Osborne at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Osborne didn't use the bow that killed Trenton, Dominic, and Ronald, choosing to engage Hamilton in close combat, Hamilton still couldn't defeat Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, his five subordinates had already been swiftly defeated by Flash. They were all lying on the ground, unconscious, looking utterly miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Flash was excitedly watching Hamilton, as if ready to join the fight at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hamilton felt utter despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop it! I give up." Finally, the injured Hamilton chose to surrender, glaring angrily at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne did not stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered, "You're only choosing to surrender now? It's too late. I think you should be lying down. That way, when I ask you questions, you might be a bit more honest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued attacking, venting his anger relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!" Hamilton's injuries kept worsening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't possibly defeat Osborne, quickly losing the strength to resist, then collapsing to the ground with a piercing scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you?" Hamilton, eyes bloodshot, stared at Osborne with a mix of anger and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finally stopped attacking and said calmly, "If you had surrendered earlier, you could've suffered less. You don't need to know who I am. You're not qualified to ask me questions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, I ask, you answer. If your answers satisfy me, I might let you die without pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, Hamilton was terrified, realizing Osborne intended to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Osborne could indeed kill Hamilton. Everything he wanted to know could likely be found in Hamilton's memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, to be on the safe side, Osborne decided to ask questions before deciding whether to kill Hamilton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He coldly said, "Are you the leader of the Frenetic Storm Warband?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hamilton gritted his teeth, seemingly unwilling to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "You don't want to answer, huh? Fine. I like tough guys like you. But I'm curious how long you can hold out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne swung the Warfare Scythe and directly cut off Hamilton's left hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!" Hamilton let out a piercing scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His wound gushed blood uncontrollably, while the corrosive power from Osborne's Sacred Power ate away at his flesh. The intense pain made his body tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hamilton said painfully, "I'll answer now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Hamilton became obedient. As soon as Osborne asked a question, Hamilton answered without the slightest delay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne's expression grew darker and darker. "How do you treat the slaves you bought?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, we beat them," Hamilton said through gritted teeth. "Most newly bought slaves are disobedient and unaware of their situation. Only constant beating and torment can make them face reality and become obedient."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Every newly bought slave has to endure more than half a month of torment before being sent to our resource-bearing planet to mine resources. If they dare to slack off or work a bit slower, the whip awaits them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne's body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed to see the image of his parents covered in wounds after being tortured when sold to the Frenetic Storm Warband. This filled him with immense anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt he had finished asking his questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only regret Osborne had was that even Hamilton was unsure whether Osborne's parents were still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne's parents were just slaves, while Hamilton was a high-ranking member of the Frenetic Storm Warband. How could he possibly care about slaves? Even when Osborne showed him a portrait, Hamilton couldn't recognize Osborne's parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since I have no more questions to ask, you can die now," Osborne said coldly, then killed Hamilton and the others without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, he began searching his memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the memories of these people, Osborne still didn't see his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It seems I can only wait until the Phantomagic Realm ends and go to the resource-bearing planet being developed by the Frenetic Storm Warband to find out if my parents are still alive."</span></p></div>
