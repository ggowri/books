        <h1>Chapter 2018 Eight Against a Hundred-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! It's time for the Ascension One Supernal Deity King match. Our turn to step onto the stage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne called out to Anastasia, Zoe, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did everyone shift their attention away from the pitiful state of Julian and refocus on the upcoming match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fifth match, was it really going to be Osborne and his group taking the field?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who else would be joining them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to the God of Light. The Human Community had already won four consecutive matches, and their morale was at its peak. If they could secure another victory, even just one more, the tide of the battle would completely turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, today, they wouldn't have to retreat. Instead, it would be the Dark Deity Legion forced to pull back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fifth match was crucial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Blood Demon members had completely crushed and slaughtered the Paramount Supreme Clan's geniuses in the previous match, when it came to the Ascension One Supernal Deity King level, no one felt confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, who else will be joining you in this match?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the God of Light couldn't help but ask, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't stop walking as he replied with a smile, "No one else. Just the eight of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the eight of them flew out of the Sanctum of Light, heading straight for the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the people inside the Sanctum of Light were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This match, only the eight of them are representing the Human Community? No one else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is madness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they're planning to strategically forfeit or surrender, they should at least fill out the numbers! Otherwise, the Paramount Supreme Clan will think we can't even muster a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ridiculous! Absolutely ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community has just won four matches in a row. If we win one more, we'll have the upper hand today. How can we just give up now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if the Human Community doesn't have much confidence in the Ascension One match, they should at least try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they really can't win, then they can surrender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, just like they did the past two days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's expressions were grim. They all believed that Osborne and his group were planning to surrender immediately, effectively giving up on the match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Jethro's voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said they're planning to surrender? If they've decided to fight with just eight people, there must be a reason! Maybe they think eight is enough. Maybe they believe having more people would just hold them back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd fell silent for a moment after Jethro's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, an even louder uproar erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madness! How can they be so arrogant? The enemy has a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings! They only have eight! How can they possibly win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they're geniuses, can they really take on ten opponents each?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are these people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did such arrogant fools come from?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd grew even angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, a cold, proud voice echoed from the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are here to challenge the so-called geniuses of the Paramount Supreme Clan once again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trash of the Paramount Supreme Clan, if you have the guts, step onto the stage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Complete and utter silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's ears rang with Osborne's words, their faces filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, they're the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! Osborne... he's their leader, Theodore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder they're so arrogant, looking down on the Paramount Supreme Clan's geniuses. It's them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've already broken through to Ascension One Supernal Deity King?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of talent is this?!"</span></p></div>
