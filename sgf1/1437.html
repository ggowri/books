        <h1>Chapter 1436 First Step</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the blood surged into Jeffrey and the others, an agonizing pain coursed through their bodies, yet they remained paralyzed, forced to let out chilling screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Lachlan, what are you doing to us?" one of them cried out in desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, you're not Lachlan! Who the hell are you?" another shouted, panic rising in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just let us die in peace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all yelled at Osborne, their voices filled with fury and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled coldly. "What I'm going to do will soon become clear to you. As for who I am, you'll find that out in due time. I strongly suggest you stop resisting; it'll only make things worse for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giving up might ease your suffering a bit. Consider it a friendly tip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he patiently awaited their response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, the group refused to relent. Despite being unable to move, they summoned their divine power, desperately trying to fight off the transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the more they struggled, the more intense the pain became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shouted curses and roared at Osborne, but as time passed, their voices began to fade. The screams of agony gradually quieted, and one by one, they succumbed to the overwhelming force of transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their agony, they reverted to their original forms, but soon, their expressions shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The defiance and anger in their eyes were replaced by deep-seated respect and submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transformation into Blood Clan members was a resounding success!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's current strength, forcibly converting them, although time-consuming, yielded the anticipated results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single one of them had been transformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jeffrey, the top-tier Transcendent Deity warrior, couldn't halt the changes taking place within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They remained themselves in body, soul, and memory, but on a deeper genetic level, they now carried a new mark: Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And not just any Blood Clan&mdash;they were now fiercely loyal to Osborne, the progenitor of their new lineage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne released the spatial bindings that had held them captive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aether Hawks Clan's Jeffrey Alick, I greet you, my Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aether Hawks Clan's Elroy Alick, I greet you, my Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rainbow Viper Clan's Derrick Margery, I greet you, my Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wild Bull Clan's Berton Wolfe, I greet you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly a hundred individuals bowed before Osborne, their eyes burning with fervor and obedience. The profound nature of Osborne's transformation ensured there would be no issues moving forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rise," Osborne said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey was his direct superior, and the others were his closest "comrades." These were the individuals most likely to see through his disguise, yet now they were all transformed into Blood Clan members, utterly loyal to his command. This significantly bolstered the security of Osborne's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, even if anyone doubted who he was, these individuals would vouch for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the Wild Flame Army, he would truly be Lachlan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, protecting his identity was just one reason for transforming them into Blood Clan members. The primary motivation was that these individuals would become his allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first step in Osborne's plan to infiltrate the Wild Flame Army and even the Ninth Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's ultimate goal was to weaken Lord Malevolence's power while simultaneously enhancing his own strength, ultimately seizing control of the entire Celestara East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He envisioned this region becoming a frontline in the resistance against Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Achieving this would be no small feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his powers fully restored, facing a Celestial Deity warrior would be a formidable challenge, but Osborne was confident he could hold his own&mdash;and win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the ranks of the Wild Flame Army, there were still many who overshadowed Osborne in terms of power. The chiliarches and leaders of ten thousand all boasted the strength of Celestial Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the generals, vice commanders, and legion commanders? They possessed at least Deity Overlord levels of strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These formidable figures were far beyond what Osborne could currently contend with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this situation applied only to the Wild Flame Army alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wild Flame Army was merely a part of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, and across the Celestara East Zone, there were nine other legions just like it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the South Zone, North Zone, and even the Central Zone, numerous other Dark Deity Legions thrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, transforming Jeffrey and nearly a hundred others into Blood Clan members was just the first shaky step Osborne had taken to establish his footing within the Wild Flame Army. His grand scheme had only just begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, his ambition igniting his spirit, "Patience is key."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A single spark can ignite a prairie fire. If I stay the course and continue to grow stronger, one day, my plans will come to fruition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The East Zone will change because of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celestara's entire landscape will be reshaped by my hand! The conflict between the native human of Celestara and Lord Malevolence's myriad tribes will be turned on its head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart surged with dreams of glory, but Osborne knew achieving this vision would require careful planning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't afford to let a promising start swell his ego.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he calmed himself, he meticulously directed the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity into the bodies of Jeffrey and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these roots intertwined with their essence, they had unwittingly gained a form of immortality&mdash;a silver lining hidden within their plight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simultaneously, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity afforded Osborne a new way to communicate silently with his newly transformed Blood Clan.</span></p></div>
