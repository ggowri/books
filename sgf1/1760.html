        <h1>Chapter 1759 Shadow Terror Fiend Showed Up</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on here?!" Osborne roared in frustration, but his Divine Body had shattered, leaving him voiceless as he awaited the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to restore him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, it didn't let him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne found himself alive again. However, the Deity King Tribulation looming above him remained relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he resurrected, a terrifying bolt of lightning struck him once more, shattering his newly restored Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a mix of disbelief and annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Why is my Deity King Tribulation so much stronger than everyone else's? For them, it's just a formality, but for me, it's like a death sentence! If it weren't for the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I'd be long gone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But wait... could it be that having the Lotus is what makes my Deity King Tribulation so fierce? Is it trying to destroy not just me but the Lotus itself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wrap his head around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least he had been through this once before. In the depths of space, he had faced the chaotic cosmic currents that shattered his Divine Body time and again, forcing him to rely on the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to resurrect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time he was broken down and rebuilt, his Divine Body emerged stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the situation felt eerily familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne remained unflustered, his safety assured as long as the Lotus remained in good condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no way this Deity King Tribulation has unlimited energy! It has to run out at some point, and when it does, I'll finally break through and become a Deity King!" Osborne thought, steeling himself for the challenge ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he endured the relentless onslaught of the Deity King Tribulation, he could feel his strength surging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every aspect of his power was on the rise, but the most significant boost came from his lightning elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been stuck at the peak of Level Six, but now it was rapidly climbing to Level Seven and still rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sensation was intoxicating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deity King Tribulation, frustrated by its inability to completely obliterate him, seemed to grow even more furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with energy as bolts of lightning rained down, making the scene resemble an apocalyptic nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time lost all meaning as the storm raged on, but suddenly, the Deity King Tribulation came to a halt. At that moment, Osborne didn't relax; instead, a chill ran down his spine as a deeper threat emerged in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity within him trembled violently, as if gripped by fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening?" Osborne froze, his expression turning grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could fully comprehend the situation, the dark clouds overhead began to contract violently, transforming into a swirling black sphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It pulsated ominously, gradually morphing into a shadowy figure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shadow Terror Fiend!" Osborne gasped in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark silhouette was all too familiar, resembling the Shadow Terror Fiend he had encountered at Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What terrified him most was the black sword it wielded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, a wave of icy dread washed over Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abomination! You don't belong in my world! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying voice echoed in Osborne's mind. In the next instant, the Shadow Terror Fiend swung its sword, and an invisible wave of energy shot toward Osborne, striking his body with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt his thoughts freeze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when the Soul Current Ocean had shattered around him, he had managed to maintain clarity, but now, as the Shadow Terror Fiend's blade connected, his mind came to a standstill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed his body breaking down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a disintegration like no other, a profound unraveling he had never experienced before. At that moment, even the energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity seemed powerless to restore him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chill of death enveloped Osborne, tightening its grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Shadow Terror Fiend loomed above him, it suddenly erupted into darkness, vanishing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the creature, Osborne's demise seemed inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And indeed, it was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was disintegrating; everything about him was falling apart. Even the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity couldn't halt this decay, nor could it prevent Osborne from slipping into death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, deep within the heart of Hope Haven, the massive humanoid stone statue began to glow, as if it had sensed something amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next heartbeat, the statue trembled violently before exploding into a brilliant light, shooting out of Hope Haven and appearing right beside Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the statue shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At its core lay an incredibly radiant pearl, emanating a dazzling brilliance that surged into Osborne's disintegrating body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the breakdown stopped, and his form began to restore itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his body mended, it became resplendent, radiating a light that filled the space around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time felt like it stretched on indefinitely, but eventually, Osborne's frozen thoughts began to flow again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He blinked open his eyes, gasping for breath, shock flooding his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm... not dead?" Osborne murmured, his voice barely above a whisper as he quickly assessed his condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit him like a freight train, leaving him utterly stunned.</span></p></div>
