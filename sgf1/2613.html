        <h1>Chapter 2500 Repair and Learning</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The people on Cobalt Island were actually just a group of Space Pirates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, they had already forced the six factions present to hand over numerous resources and wealth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The resources were all used to repair the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But each faction had to hand over ten million Sacred Crystals, which had nothing to do with repairing the translocator&mdash;it was pure robbery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, everyone on Cobalt Island has been killed, their Dimensional Bags found by Osborne, and everything has become Osborne's spoils of war.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne has no intention of returning those Sacred Crystals to the surrounding factions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those people don't dare to ask him for it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, they would be killed just like the people on Cobalt Island. When they saw Osborne unleash a volley of arrows, instantly killing two advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors and dozens of mid and primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors, they were all terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if they saw with their own eyes Osborne collecting Cobalt Island's Dimensional Bags, they didn't dare to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, they only sent Azael over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Azael had previously talked with Osborne and Agatha and was familiar with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Augustine." Azael was a bit nervous at this moment. Previously, he had regarded Osborne as just an ordinary Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King and didn't pay much attention to him, focusing more on Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, seeing Osborne, Azael felt his legs trembling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's strength was terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne's pet beast could easily handle advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael had already concluded that Osborne must be a super warrior who used special means to hide his strength and cultivation level, or he was already an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, how could he easily annihilate advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, everyone on Cobalt Island has been killed. What are your plans next?" Azael asked cautiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced at him and said calmly, "Of course, to repair the Cosmic Translocator and then head to Inferno Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half a year ago, the Frenetic Storm Warband appeared on Inferno Planet, so Osborne's destination was also Inferno Planet to gather clues about the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Repair the Cosmic Translocator?" Azael was stunned, then said excitedly, "Mr. Augustine, you can repair the Cosmic Translocator?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "If we couldn't repair the Cosmic Translocator, why would we target the people of Cobalt Island? I'm also eager to get to Inferno Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne took out some resources from the harvested Dimensional Bag and handed them to Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela nodded. "I'll fix the Cosmic Translocator within a day."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Angela got busy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne ignored Azael, being more interested in repairing the Cosmic Translocator. He followed Angela to watch her repair it firsthand and learn from the process.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela had already organized what she learned into Memory Fragments and transmitted them to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne absorbed the knowledge from the Memory Fragments while observing Angela's actual operations, quickly deepening his understanding of the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not that hard</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After activating Satan's Eye, every detail of the Cosmic Translocator became crystal clear to him, like a 3D blueprint.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, he had no understanding of the principles, but now, after just a brief study, he had gained insights and felt that building a Cosmic Translocator wouldn't be difficult for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, this was due to his strong comprehension abilities and spatial power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For others, even with someone teaching, they might not be able to learn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha had no interest in dealing with Azael or repairing the Cosmic Translocator, so she simply meditated nearby with her eyes closed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael, seeing no one paying attention to him, could only awkwardly retreat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael's elder, an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior, quickly asked, "How did it go? What did they say?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Will Mr. Augustine really repair the Cosmic Translocator? After it's fixed, will they allow us to use it? Are there any extra conditions?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the others also gathered around, looking worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael shook his head. "Mr. Augustine can indeed repair the Cosmic Translocator. They didn't make any demands, and once it's fixed, we can use it together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's good!" Everyone breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They watched Osborne and the other two from a distance, their eyes filled with fear and shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We don't know what method Osborne used to hide his cultivation level. He is likely an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior. We must not offend him. If he needs anything, we must fulfill it. Otherwise, the fate of those on Cobalt Island will be ours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The people of Cobalt Island were just unlucky to encounter Osborne, who hid his cultivation level... If they had known Osborne was an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior, how would they have dared to extort or rob them?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah. Luckily, we didn't make a move against Osborne earlier."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People whispered to each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne completely ignored them. At this moment, he was fully immersed in learning. At first, he couldn't quite understand Angela's movements or why she was doing them, but after just half a day, Osborne had already figured it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He already understood the reason behind each of Angela's movements.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After some more time, Osborne could already predict Angela's next move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even felt that he could complete the repair of this Cosmic Translocator himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn't speak and continued learning quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gradually, Osborne's understanding of the Cosmic Translocator grew deeper, and because of his spatial power, he even surpassed Angela in his knowledge of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could even spot errors in Angela's repair actions or come up with more convenient, faster, and material-saving repair methods.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela had mentioned that it took her three full years to master the techniques for repairing the Cosmic Translocator, thanks to the guidance of the Fairy Moon Sect teacher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, if she had relied solely on self-study, it might not have been successful even in ten years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, Osborne, with just the Memory Fragments Angela gave him, took less than a day to surpass Angela's skills and understand the Cosmic Translocator better than she did.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that with his current level, repairing the Cosmic Translocator wouldn't even take a day&mdash;half a day would be enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, he could save at least one-third of the materials.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In the future, if I come across a slightly damaged Cosmic Translocator, I can repair it myself. However, I can only repair it; I still don't know how to build a Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Ms. Alba ha</span><span>d</span><span> already transmitted the information on building the Cosmic Translocator to </span><span>him</span><span>. It just </span><span>took</span><span> some time to transfer across the Stellar Region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">When I get this information, I should be able to learn how to build a Cosmic Translocator. In the future, no matter where I go, I won't have to worry about getting lost&mdash;I can rely on myself to build a Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Angela finally stopped her actions and infused a stream of Sacred Power into the Cosmic Translocator, instantly activating it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Alright, the Cosmic Translocator is fixed. Now, we can leave. This Cosmic Translocator can directly transport us to Inferno Planet."</span></p></div>
