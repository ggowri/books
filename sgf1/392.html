        <h1>Chapter 392 Strange Isa</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Isa immediately turned around and glared fiercely at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder you said so many nice things to me. It turns out you want to ask me for help again. You won't come to see me until my assistance is needed, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isa finished speaking, Osborne couldn't help but be stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that her tone sounded complaining and dissatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she complain that he didn't visit her more often and that he only came when her help was necessary?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was it so strange?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne touched his nose, not daring to think further, and quickly said, "Isa, I'm sorry. Various matters have lately occupied me. After this period, I will definitely come to see you more often. But this time, I really need your help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa snorted, "Tell me, what do you want me to help you with? You are already a Class A martial master. There are not many people in Dampston who can defeat you. You have finally made progress and become a real man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, did you discover that I made a breakthrough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa remained composed. "Should I feign ignorance? You've managed to restrain your power quite effectively. You've just advanced, but your control over your strength is impressive. It appears you've finally grasped the true purpose of the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, despite your effort to hold back your strength, you can't hide it from me. Even without a glance at you, I can sense that you have made a breakthrough only by feeling the breeze you bring after you pass by."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isa finished speaking, Osborne was even more dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not because of how powerful she was but because she knew so much about the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did she notice that Osborne could control his strength right after his breakthrough because of the Breath of Celestial?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did she know its true purpose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, have you also practiced the Breath of Celestial?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Isa shook her head without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! The Breath of Celestial is not for everyone. I tried but failed. And I can tell you that you are the only one who has successfully practiced it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I the only one who has successfully practiced it? Did the Godfather fail?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa exclaimed, "Of course, he failed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa continued, "In short, remember that the Breath of Celestial is very important. You must practice it frequently in the future. When you ascend to the fifth or even sixth level, its true power will finally be revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't slack off. I have confidence in you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beaming, Isa patted Osborne's shoulder, as if believing that he had a bright future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rubbed his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still found it somewhat strange. Isa appeared well-versed in the knowledge of the Breath of Celestial. Moreover, when it came to the Godfather, her tone betrayed much casualness and indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she even sounded...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dissatisfied?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown, curious about Isa's identity and her relationship with the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, what are you pondering? You haven't told me yet what you want me to do for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa interrupted Osborne's thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly suppressed the doubts and explained everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Isa gazed at him with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done. You're finally starting to act like a leader and see things from a broader perspective! Your concerns and suspicions are likely to come true. The King of the Aberrants is highly ambitious. He won't relent on revenge, nor will he relinquish control over the underground world of Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, barring accidents, the Aberrants will definitely attack the Augustine family's cruise ships. Their main goal is to tarnish the reputation of the Draco Group but not to disrupt the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as the Aberrants succeed, the myth of the invincibility of the Draco Group will be shattered, and many forces in Rosmandi will no longer be so afraid of the Draco Group and the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are likely to support the Aberrants then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isa finished speaking, Osborne's expression became serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Serena was impulsive this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa added, "Yet, you may be the cause. Serena might have garnered tacit approval from the Godfather, aiming to foster your rapid growth through such a risky maneuver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, the Maritime Auction poses significant risks. Your decision to seek my help demonstrates that you're not merely acting out of blind arrogance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through Isa's words, he realized many problems that he had not considered before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "Sure enough, strength represents level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher your level, the more you perceive. Without sufficient strength, you'll never glimpse the true world. It's as if something blinds your eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like ordinary people, they lead busy lives, perhaps aspiring primarily to earn more money, secure easier jobs, and enjoy weekends traveling with their families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lack awareness that there are martial artists and metahumans akin to gods in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strength determines height and vision!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and said, "Isa, this time, it's extremely risky, so I need your help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled, "Sorry, I can't help you this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p></div>
