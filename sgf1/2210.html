        <h1>Chapter 2193 Accept-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, stunned and disoriented, his mind a maelstrom of chaotic thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could what Isa said be true?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But... I have no recollection of it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Am I truly the reincarnation of the God of Night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Isa is correct, then everything begins to fall into place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take, for example, the fact that Isa publicly announced she was the God of Night's woman. It doesn't imply she betrayed </span><span>Osborne</span><span>. Instead, it means... </span><span>He is</span><span> the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Isa is </span><span>his</span><span> woman, it's only natural that she's also the God of Night's woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If </span><span>he is</span><span> not the reincarnation of the God of Night, then why is this powerful Isa so smitten with </span><span>him</span><span>? She found </span><span>him</span><span> when</span><span> he</span><span> was vulnerable, chose to pr</span><span>otect and instruct </span><span>him</span><span>, constantly reminding </span><span>him</span><span> that time was running out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if </span><span>he is</span><span> not the reincarnation of the God of Night, how did </span><span>he</span><span> come to meet Ophelia, Clarissa, Emma, and Austin, and form such deep-seated bonds with them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They are the reincarnations of the God of Time, the Goddess of Fate, the God of Death, and the Goddess of Life. If </span><span>he was</span><span> just an ordinary mortal, how could </span><span>their</span><span> paths possibly have crossed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if </span><span>he is</span><span> the reincarnation of the God of Night, everything clicks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all once orphans taken under the God of Night's wing, </span><span>who were </span><span>nurtured and raised</span><span> by him and</span><span> develop</span><span>ed</span><span> affection for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If </span><span>he was</span><span> not the reincarnation of the God of Night, </span><span>what could account for his</span><span> rapid progress in cultivation? How did </span><span>he</span><span> attain such extraordinary talent?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All signs point to the same inevitable conclusion&mdash;</span><span>He is</span><span> the reincarnation of the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He</span><span> was destined to become the most powerful warrior on Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of disbelief mingled with acceptance washed over Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revelation was like a thunderbolt, almost too much to process. Just a short while ago, he had been cursing the God of Night for not showing up to protect Isa when she fought Lord Malevolence. He had even sworn to get rid of the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, I'm the God of Night? Am I supposed to take myself out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but let out a laugh at the sheer absurdity of the situation. But Osborne was made of tough stuff. He quickly pushed those thoughts to the back of his mind. Strangely enough, the idea of being the reincarnation of the God of Night wasn't as terrifying as he'd first thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What really mattered now was putting an end to the long-standing conflict with Lord Malevolence and bringing an end to the war that had haunted Celestara Planet for thousands of years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Lord Malevolence, his voice calm and resolute. "Lord Malevolence, can we finally have a fair showdown? Are you still going to claim that I'm unworthy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's face darkened, but he kept his mouth shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't back down. "Let's swap hostages! You let Isa go, and I'll release Maddox. Then, we'll have a fair fight to settle this war once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Lord Malevolence shot a glance at Maddox, who was in Osborne's tight grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of hesitation flashed across his face. He clearly wasn't keen on making the exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's power dwarfed Maddox's by a wide margin. Before the God of Night entered the cycle of reincarnation, he had channeled all his might into Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Isa, as she was now, was the real "God of Night".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence had once struggled mightily to overcome Isa. Had it not been for his recent leap to Ascension Ten, victory would have been out of his reach.</span></p></div>
