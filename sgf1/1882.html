        <h1>Chapter 1881 Kill Them All?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor said, "Of course, you can also bet that I won't find you. But if worse comes to worst, I'll just kill everyone here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke with a mocking glint in his eyes, floating defiantly in mid-air, his majestic and arrogant demeanor back in full force as his cold gaze swept over the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment those trapped within the light shield heard his words, panic erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had only come to watch the fun, and now they found themselves ensnared by Trevor's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The threat of him killing them all if he couldn't locate Osborne sent several people fleeing in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they rushed towards the edge, they were immediately thrown back by the crimson light shield. It was solid and unyielding, and no amount of effort could budge it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere shifted from curiosity to sheer terror as more and more people began to pound against the barrier in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew grave. "The Universe-Sealing Formation? What a formidable defense! Even the strongest Divine Kings can't break through it! Now I'm trapped. This is a serious problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed that Nadia and Alicia were also trapped within the crimson light shield, unable to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frown crossed his face as he rapidly brainstormed for a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he noticed the crimson barrier was shrinking quickly. If this continued, the space inside would become unbearably tight, forcing everyone to huddle together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he could still use the Eclipsing Mantra to mask his presence and blend into the surroundings, he wouldn't be able to hide for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anxiety crept into Osborne's demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop struggling. It's useless!" Trevor called out again. He had searched the area multiple times without success in finding Osborne, and his frustration was mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snapped, "Theodore, you're really good at hiding! But you can't escape. I know you're still here. Come out! The Universe-Sealing Formation will be compressed to its limit soon. No matter where you hide, you'll be ground to dust! And everyone else will die because of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent another wave of fear through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Baxter, I'm Cole Bates from the Falcon Alliance! I'm just here to watch&mdash;please don't kill me! Let me go!" someone shouted desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Falcon Alliance was a First-rate Power, well-known for its ties to the Baxter family, who treated it like a mere lapdog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cole thought revealing his identity would earn him mercy, but he was mistaken. Trevor merely glanced at him with icy indifference, his eyes filled with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor couldn't afford to let Osborne escape; he had stolen 10 Ultimate Luminous Armors and three Ultimate divine artifacts&mdash;things too valuable to allow any chance for escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, if Cole was allowed to leave, it could create a gap in the Universe-Sealing Formation, giving Osborne the opportunity to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Trevor resolved not to lower the barrier until he found Osborne, ignoring the pleas of anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne continued to hide, Trevor saw no choice but to kill everyone trapped within. They could only blame their bad luck for choosing to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's expression darkened. Despite many onlookers being influential figures from various factions&mdash;including two members of the Hudson family&mdash;he felt no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Supernal Deity King, he was unconcerned as long as none of the other Supernal Deity Kings were present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also dismissed any worry about potential repercussions from the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were one of the 10 major families in the Human Community and Dukedom Level Power, the Hudson family's influence had waned, whereas the Baxter family had grown stronger. If the Hudson family dared to retaliate, Trevor would use the opportunity to teach them a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's expression became colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "Theodore, you coward! Still hiding? Don't say I didn't warn you! Universe-Sealing Formation, accelerate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the crimson light shield began to shrink at an alarming rate. Everything within twisted and deformed as panic ensued among those trapped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Baxter, please stop! We're on the same side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Baxter, have mercy! I'm not Theodore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Baxter..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chorus of frantic pleas filled the air as everyone desperately begged for their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alicia and Nadia, their expressions stern, shouted at Trevor, "Trevor, stop! We're from the Hudson family! How dare you try to kill us? Stop this madness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor merely sneered, ignoring their threats and pleas for mercy. His murderous intent only deepened as his eyes continued to scan the area for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was on the brink of being discovered.</span></p></div>
