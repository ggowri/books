        <h1>Chapter 1524 Level Six Lightning Elemental Essence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Osborne had used a strand of core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to enhance his lightning elemental essence, pushing it to the peak of Level Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just a hair's breadth away from breaking into Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as he relentlessly unleashed Thunder Power to obliterate the Deathborn, his lightning elemental essence finally surged past that threshold, reaching Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this newfound power, Osborne's Thunder Power instantly gained a significant boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing Deathborn became even easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To take down a Transcendent Deity-level Deathborn, he now required only a fraction of the effort he had used before, and his control over the lightning was more precise and effortless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his speed in dispatching the Deathborn increased dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Osborne had relied on his experience and the advantage Thunder Power had against the Deathborn, allowing him to match Hannah's pace despite her superior strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never worried about exhausting his divine power, allowing him to keep fighting indefinitely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne was outpacing Hannah by a considerable margin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden change left Hannah in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you just break through? Are you at mid-Celestial Deity now? How is that possible? Weren't you just at Celestial Deity yesterday? Even if you're a super genius using Ultimate Essence Crystals or Celestial Crystals, it shouldn't be this fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her astonishment was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled casually, "I haven't actually broken through. It's just my lightning elemental essence that's reached Level Six."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's eyes widened in disbelief, her mouth agape as she stood frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level Six elemental essence?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your elemental essence was only at the peak of Level Five before? And now you're just at Level Six? Is Level Six really that powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't Level Six elemental essence supposed to be strong? What level is yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah replied, "My life elemental essence is at the early Level Six! And my dark elemental essence has reached the mid stage of Level Six!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, he had just cleared the Deathborn in front of him, and the others were still a distance away; otherwise, losing focus in battle could have been disastrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Hannah's elemental essence level to be so high! But somehow, it didn't feel that impressive to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that my training method is different? That's why my Level Six elemental essence feels stronger?" he pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne said aloud, "Maybe it's because my elemental essence is mutated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've seen mutated Level Six Thunder Power before, but none have been as powerful as yours! They didn't even come close to half your strength," Hannah said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged, choosing not to elaborate further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "It's a shame that breaking through to Level Six with my lightning elemental essence didn't unlock any new power techniques, just like with spatial and dark elemental essences. Perhaps I'll gain new techniques when I reach Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Level Seven elemental essence is exclusive to Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still have four core energies from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I use them all to boost my space elemental essence, there's a good chance I could push it past Level Seven. Should I give it a shot?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I break through, my power will skyrocket! My ability to protect myself would be on another level, and I wouldn't have to worry even if I ran into a Deity King warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt tempted by the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then again, maybe I should save the core energies from the Lotus for emergencies. I think I can level up my space elemental essence to Level Seven on my own with a bit more time. Besides, right now, I'm 'Lachlan,' so I don't really need the space elemental essence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that decision made, Osborne pushed those thoughts aside and returned to the fight, fully focused on the battle at hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Hannah had fully replenished her divine power, but instead of diving back into the fray, she remained focused on Osborne, watching him like a hawk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had become her practical teacher in combat, and Hannah felt as if she were absorbing lessons with every move he made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they pushed deeper into the main mine, the two of them carved a path through wave after wave of Deathborns, their numbers dwindling in the face of their relentless assault. The slain Deathborns piled up, and Osborne lost count of how many they had dispatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each kill, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity absorbed a ton of high-grade death scent, and finally, its roots regained their vitality, standing tall and lush once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This development delighted Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lotus was only a step away from full recovery, with just its leaves and flowers yet to regain their full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, he figured that within three days, the Lotus would be completely revitalized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "It's a pity these Deathborns are all a bit weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only there were Celestial Deity-ranked Deathborns, killing one of them would allow the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to absorb a more refined high-grade death scent, accelerating its recovery speed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered this, Satan's Eye swept deeper into the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Osborne's expression turned serious. "Watch out! A massive group of Celestial Deity-level Deathborn is approaching!"</span></p></div>
