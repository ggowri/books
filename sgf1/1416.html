        <h1>Chapter 1415 Osborne's Ambition</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply, a mixture of disbelief and indignation swirling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence is human!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as one of his kind, he brings death and destruction to Celestara, saturating the land with the scent of death and spawning creatures like the Deathborn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He has nearly wiped out ninety percent of the human deities in Celestara. He allows his diverse army to enslave, torment, and kill humans as if they were nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems to me that Lord Malevolence doesn't regard the native humans of Celestara as his equals at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne let out a cold snort of derision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan, despite his position as a squad leader in the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, had only scratched the surface of Lord Malevolence's true nature. For Osborne, while this information revealed the existence of the World of Racial Convergence in the depths of the cosmos, it didn't hold much immediate value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more intriguing to Osborne were Lachlan's other memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Swift family? In Celestara's East Zone, human life is precarious, but some families, like the Swift family, managed to thrive due to their early allegiance to Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Swift family is one of the top human clans in the East Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of the Swift family is a formidable Deity Overlord warrior, respected even by other races. Lachlan's rise to squad leader was because of them, though he himself wasn't held in high regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Living alone in Wild Flame City, one of the three major cities in the East Zone, Lachlan occupies a modest position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside its walls, a staggering force of 500 thousand troops from the Ninth Dark Deity Legion is stationed, known as the Wild Flame Army. Lachlan is just another unassuming squad leader within that large framework."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly absorbed these insights, piecing together the dynamics at play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned his attention to the memories of the four fallen Superior Deity warriors, each hailing from a distinct race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he sifted through their memories, a clearer picture of the current state of Celestara began to form, as well as a deeper understanding of the various factions under Lord Malevolence's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's how it is. The races under Lord Malevolence aren't a united front after all. There's competition among them, just like in human society! Each race functions like a massive family, jockeying for achievements and resources..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne processed this newfound knowledge, his plans began to solidify.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "I need to stay in the East Zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The West Zone was the stronghold of the human resistance and still under human control, where he would undoubtedly be safer and enjoy a better environment for cultivation to boost his strength, even having the chance to reunite with Isa and Clarissa under the protective shadows of top-tier Deity Kings like God of Light and God of Night and fight against Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he couldn't go to the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Grand Elder of the Prophet Alliance had warned him that venturing to the West Zone within the year would bring about a cataclysm. His prophecies had always proven true; there was no need to tempt fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the West Zone wasn't lacking another human cultivator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne rushed there and joined the human resistance, his current strength, equivalent at best to a Transcendent Deity, wouldn't significantly bolster their forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resistance needed top-tier Deity Overlords, even Deity Kings, not someone who could be effortlessly wiped out by a mere Celestial Deity warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, his presence in the West Zone would do little to advance the human cause of Celestara. But staying in the East Zone promised potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could plant a seed there, a seed that might one day grow into a giant tree providing shelter for human cultivators. Perhaps one day, Osborne could undermine the East Zone's Dark Deity Legion from within, creating new human footholds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne made up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would stay and develop in the East Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would disguise himself as Lachlan, infiltrate the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, and rise through its ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't be easy, and he didn't have much confidence, but he believed it was worth the risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Eclipsing Mantra and Lachlan's memories, I can perfectly mimic Lachlan. Not even Lachlan's closest allies could see through my disguise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I will transform members of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion into Blood Clan gradually, making them loyal only to me, my secret underlings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And one day, I will ascend as the highest general of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion! I will seize complete control, not just of the legion, but of the entire East Zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With this determination, Osborne began to transform.</span></p></div>
