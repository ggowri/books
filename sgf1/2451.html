        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After studying it for a while, he returned the Warfare Shield to the Warfare Ancient Tree, letting it continue nurturing it and striving to upgrade it to a top-grade Sacred Artifact as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Osborne made some requests to the Warfare Ancient Tree. He hoped to modify the Warfare Shield to better suit him, even establishing a Bloodline Connection with it like the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was very simple for the Warfare Ancient Tree, requiring only some of Osborne's blood and Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne placed the Bloodwrought Bow on the Warfare Ancient Tree as well, letting it continue nurturing and enhancing the bow's power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Regarding the Bloodwrought Bow, Osborne had only one request for the Warfare Ancient Tree: to enhance its attack power as much as possible. What he wanted was for the Bloodwrought Bow to possess ultimate offensive strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne took out the battle blade from the Warfare Ancient Tree, another Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle blade was a mid-grade Sacred Artifact with great power. However, Osborne felt it didn't suit him, and he wasn't very fond of weapons like battle blades.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking for a moment, Osborne handed the battle blade to Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha was stunned, staring blankly at Osborne, completely puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "I want to give this battle blade to you. After all, we came here together. Now that I've gained so much, how could I not give you something? Besides, you can't easily use the power of the Dark Phoenix in the future, nor can you use the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute or the Phoenix Skeletal Shield anymore, to avoid being recognized. So, you happen to need a Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This battle blade is also a mid-grade Sacred Artifact. It may not suit you perfectly, but it shouldn't be much worse than your Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Phoenix Skeletal Shield. With this battle blade, your strength won't drop much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne forcibly handed the battle blade to Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Holding the battle blade, Agatha looked completely dazed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never expected Osborne to share a Sacred Artifact with her. This was a mid-grade Sacred Artifact, and it was grown on the Warfare Ancient Tree, making it stronger than ordinary mid-grade Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Phoenix Skeletal Shield were just ordinary mid-grade Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The value of a mid-grade Sacred Artifact was astonishingly high for anyone, and even blood brothers might not be willing to give it away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne gave it to her without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha bit her lip, lowered her head to look at the battle blade, and felt the power within it. She couldn't help but sigh, thinking, "I owe Osborne even more now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she did not refuse. In the future, she would have to live under a different identity and could no longer use the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Phoenix Skeletal Shield. She truly needed a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Agatha softly said, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "If you have time in the future, you can give me this battle blade, and I'll place it on the Warfare Ancient Tree to let it continue nurturing and enhancing it for you. Also, give me some of your Sacred Power and blood. The Warfare Ancient Tree can adjust the blade to make it more compatible with you, unleashing greater power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, it might even suit you better than your Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Phoenix Skeletal Shield."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha gritted her teeth, then nodded. "Osborne, thank you. You've done so much for me. I originally wanted to help you and repay some of the kindness. But I realize I owe you even more now. I..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, interrupting Agatha, "Don't say things like that anymore. I'm helping you not because I want something in return. Besides, this is an investment. You're the Dark Phoenix, and you'll surely become a big figure in the Ember Phoenix Clan, a top warrior in the cosmos. Since I'm helping you now, you'll have to protect me in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha bit her lower lip and nodded firmly. "If that day comes, I will. Whatever it is, just tell me. As long as I can do it, I'll do my best to help you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "That's good. Let's go. Let's keep exploring here together and see if there are any other treasures."</span></p></div>
