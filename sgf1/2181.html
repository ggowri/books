        <h1>Chapter 2168 Our Turn to Make a Move</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time spat, teeth clenched in frustration, "You're just a bunch of cowards, ganging up on me like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky erupted in laughter. "You've got that right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At Mystic Sirius Sect, we believe in the power of numbers! If we can gang up on you, why would we ever fight one-on-one? It's just smart strategy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words drew chuckles from Tyrese and the others, their amusement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time's expression darkened further. "Mystic Sirius Sect, huh? I'll remember that. Just wait until I get to Racial Convergence Planet; I'll make you pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky and Tyrese burst into laughter again, as if she'd just told the funniest joke in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's so funny?" she snapped, irritation boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky scoffed and said, "We're laughing because you're so out of touch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can take revenge on Mystic Sirius Sect? Ha! You have no idea how powerful we are! Even on Racial Convergence Planet, we're a major force! With Empyrean Sacredness warriors backing us, you think you stand a chance? You're practically asking for trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you dare show up at Mystic Sirius Sect, you'll be walking right into a lion's den! But you won't get that chance, because today, we're taking you captive and handing you over to the higher-ups at Mystic Sirius Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your talents will be stripped from you, and everything you have will be taken away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, enough chit-chat. Let's get you captured!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then addressed his companions, "Let's do this together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ricky launched another attack, and this time, Tyrese and the other five Ascension Seven Supernal Deity Kings joined in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they weren't as powerful as Ricky, they were no pushovers either. Individually, the God of Time might have held her ground, but together, their combined strength was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time's expression hardened as she desperately swung the Whip of Time, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up against six foes of equal cultivation level and one even more powerful, she stood no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, she found herself in a perilous situation, on the verge of defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Anger flared in her eyes as she realized she couldn't keep this up much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, she shouted, "Isa, are you just going to stand there? The Human Community is under the protection of the God of Night, and you claim to be his woman! With the Human Community in such peril, why haven't you stepped in yet? Are you really going to let down the God of Night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice echoed like thunder, reaching everyone around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky and his companions exchanged uneasy glances. "She has reinforcements?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their alertness heightened as they scanned the area, but they felt no immediate threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky scoffed, dismissing her words. "Little girl, don't even bother struggling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one's coming to save you! Not even the God of Night himself could rescue you now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a promise!" he declared, confidence radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, far from the border battlefield, on a towering black temple, four strikingly beautiful figures stood, gazing into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa asked, turning to the three stunning women behind her, "Are you ready?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence has revealed his cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, it's our turn to make a move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the three women exchanged determined glances, their eyes blazing with battle spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three women&mdash;Clarissa, Emma, and Austin&mdash;stood resolute. To be precise, Clarissa was the reincarnation of the Goddess of Fate, Emma was the reincarnation of the God of Death, and Austin was the reincarnation of the Goddess of Life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had returned from the cycle of reincarnation, and with Isa's help, they had regained their memories and powers, reaching the peak of their former selves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa declared firmly, "We fight now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, he's not back yet, and we need to buy him more time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma and Austin nodded in agreement, their determination clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded back, smiling, "Alright, let's go! I've heard God of Time's call for help; she's on the brink of collapse! If we don't show up soon, she's going to be in serious trouble. Regardless of how things have changed, she was like a sister to you, and it's time to help her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gentle wave of her hand, Isa commanded the massive Sanctum of Night, which had been dormant for countless years, to awaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal structure surged into the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Sanctum of Night vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the God of Time found herself in an increasingly perilous situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounded by Ricky, Tyrese, and the other five, she struggled to defend herself. Even as she swung the Whip of Time, her efforts were becoming desperate. Strikes landed on her, and blood trickled from her mouth, painting a grim picture of her state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth, fighting with every ounce of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below, the Human Alliance watched in dread, their expressions heavy with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, we have to help her! I can't stand her, but right now, she's the last hope for the Human Community. If she goes down, we're all finished!" Zoe bit her lip, anxiety etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia shook her head, equally troubled. "We can't help! Even the weakest among them is an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King. If we step in, we'll be wiped out in seconds! We're powerless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words silenced the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just them; every warrior in the Human Community felt the same helplessness. In such a monumental battle, without an Ascension Seven cultivation level, stepping in would be tantamount to suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they could do was pray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the God of Time was sent flying, spitting out another mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Whip of Time in her hand flickered dimly, struggling to maintain its form, on the verge of vanishing completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through her as she realized the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Whip of Time disappeared, she would be defeated and captured in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of being captured sent chills down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky's laughter rang out. "Give it up, little girl! You're out of options!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community on Celestara Planet is doomed! Ever since Zayne came to us for help, your failure was sealed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just surrender now, and you might avoid some pain! Otherwise, I won't hold back on you...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glinted with malice as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time clenched her jaw. "Stop talking nonsense! You think I'd ever surrender to the likes of you? You'll all pay when the God of Night arrives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky scoffed and said, "What a joke! The God of Night? Just a genius from a small place, not worth a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he dares show his face, I'll personally put him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a cold voice suddenly interrupted, "Is that so?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I hear you right? You want to kill the God of Night?"</span></p></div>
