        <h1>Chapter 2246 Underdog-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vadim! Jamar! I'll be waiting for you in the top twenty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Starting tomorrow, I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> take you both down and seize the top spot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Bethan </span><span>threw</span><span> down the gauntlet, the crowd went wild with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The challenge has been issued! Bethan clearly isn't satisfied with just being third. She's gunning for Jamar in second and Vadim in first! Tomorrow's top-twenty matches are going to be off the charts! We're in for a real treat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! The group stage was just a practice run. The real battle starts now! Bethan, Jamar, and Vadim are in a league of their own compared to the other Mystic Sirius Sect disciples. Even when you measure them against all the young talents in Tempest Fortress City, they're among the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me below the Empyrean Sacredness! Last year, Vadim took fourth place, Jamar came in eighth, and Bethan landed in tenth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this year, their rankings could shuffle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how things turn out, the top three spots in Mystic Sirius Sect will surely go to those three! They're the only ones with the skills to represent us in the city duel and bring back some glory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm cheering for Bethan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm on Jamar's side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm behind Vadim!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm betting on the dark horse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dark horse? Come on! Up against those three, any so-called dark horse will end up a total failure&mdash;no match at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was abuzz with excitement. Every now and then, someone would bring up Osborne, speculating that he might have dispatched his opponents even more rapidly in the group stage and could be an underdog capable of challenging heavyweights like Bethan, Jamar, and Vadim in the top-twenty showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as fast, others chimed in to shoot down that notion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were convinced that Osborne's quick wins were simply because his opponents were weak and careless, not to mention the boost from his powerful </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he faced the real heavy hitters in the top twenty, he was bound to crumble and would be lucky just to scrape into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All in all, only a handful of people held out any hope for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even most of the Elders and Peak Lords of the Mystic Sirius Sect figured that the top ten was the furthest he could go, and that would take a lucky break. The idea of him emerging as a dark horse to challenge Bethan, Jamar, and Vadim was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was completely oblivious to all this chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd returned to his quarters, sealed himself off once again, and activated the time-acceleration feature to hunker down and focus on his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first day of the tournament was just the group-stage preliminaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tomorrow, the top-twenty showdown would kick off and run for three days. He'd have to take on each of the other nineteen contestants, with six or seven battles a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't the slightest bit worried about the top-twenty matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were fixed on a much grander prize&mdash;the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't even make a name for himself in the Mystic Sirius Sect's internal selection, what business did he have competing in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His real rivals weren't in the Mystic Sirius Sect, nor in Tempest Fortress City or Zephyr State. They were spread far and wide across the entire Eastern Zone 3!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Come what may, he had to come out on top in the Eastern Zone 3 regional duel to secure his spot in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. Only then could he enter the Royal Sepulcher to pay his respects to his mother from his past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne made the most of every single moment to beef up his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he knew it, a day had flown by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group stage had wrapped up, and the air around the arena crackled with energy. Even more onlookers had flocked in to chew over the previous day's bouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some folks had even set up impromptu betting rings nearby, where anyone could place their bets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vadim to take the win, odds 1.2 to 1!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jamar to win, odds 1.5 to 1!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bethan to win, odds 1.6 to 1!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Draymond Rush to win, odds 15 to 1!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Valenta</span><span> Kinski to win, odds 25 to 1!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne to win, odds..."</span></p></div>
