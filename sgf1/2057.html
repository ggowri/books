        <h1>Chapter 2049 Arrival at Elf City</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the Spatial Translocator activated, the six-pointed star formation engraved on the dark stone erupted in a blinding light, manifesting a massive star pattern at Osborne's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful surge of spatial energy radiated from the design, enveloping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This spatial energy... it's incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So rich and powerful!" Osborne exclaimed, his eyes wide with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a multitude of stars appeared in his mind, hundreds of them twinkling in the distance. One star shone brightest and lay farthest away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are all these star points?" he asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's voice echoed in his mind, providing clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each star point represents a possible destination for teleportation! The brightest one is Elf City! The other stars mark locations the Eighth World Tree offshoot traveled to using the Spatial Translocator. Only the marked places are eligible for future teleportation. Remember our position here; we'll need to come back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding dawned on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These star points must be places the Eighth World Tree offshoot visited! If it marked them, they must be significant, right? Surely there are some treasures?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial quickly burst his bubble. "Dreaming big, are we? If there really were treasures, they wouldn't be within your reach!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Based on the memories from the Eighth World Tree offshoot, the locations it marked were near dangerous areas! If the offshoot found them hazardous, trust me, it's best you steer clear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, dangerous places could mean valuable finds, but you're still too weak. Better to play it safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, serious determination etched on his face. "Don't worry, I value my life more than you think! I won't jump into the unknown without a solid plan. Now let's head straight for Elf City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, he mentally selected the coordinates for Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six-pointed star formation flared even brighter, and a terrifying wave of spatial energy enveloped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the star pattern vanished, and so did Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt himself undergoing interdimensional travel, a sensation that was far faster than anything he had achieved on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere seconds, Osborne was spanning vast, unimaginable distances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This interdimensional travel lasted about ten minutes before he felt the speed slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ahead of him, a dimensional portal materialized, inscribed with a series of twisted characters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne squinted, unsure of what the symbols meant. Yet, as he gazed upon them, comprehension washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elf City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was floored by the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had never imagined Elf City could construct a dimensional portal within an interdimensional passage. Such spatial manipulation was beyond his capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he approached, the dimensional portal slowly swung open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing behind it were two Elf men, their bodies largely exposed except for strategically placed green leaves concealing their private areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked like security guards but bore an air of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, they shot Osborne a disdainful glance. A voice echoed in his mind, cold and matter-of-fact, "Entry fee for a Human Community Ascension One Supernal Deity King is 10 thousand Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's jaw dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frantically, he communicated with Primordial, disbelief creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, entry fee? Ten thousand Celestial Crystals? Do you have any idea how much that is? Even Second-rate Powers in Celestara would struggle to scrape together that amount!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial felt a twinge of embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should've reminded you earlier! But come on, it's just 10 thousand Celestial Crystals! That's nothing for you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The problem is, you didn't remind me, and I left all my Celestial Crystals back in Hope Haven! I thought they were useless to me now! I don't have a single one on me! What am I supposed to do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He actually had billions of Celestial Crystals stashed away, so the entry fee was a mere drop in the bucket for him. But the key issue was that he hadn't brought any with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way he could just zip back and grab some crystals before returning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial felt a pang of guilt for not reminding Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, what do you have in your Dimensional Bag?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got a few Miracle Elixirs&mdash;less than two hundred, actually. The rest is just my Bloodwrought Armor and Bloodwrought Bow. Everything else is back at Hope Haven," Osborne replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial thought for a moment. "Miracle Elixirs should work..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them quickly brainstormed their options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the two Elf guards behind the dimensional portal exchanged glances, their expressions dripping with disdain as they noticed Osborne's troubled demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them scoffed, saying, "Ten thousand Celestial Crystals, and you don't have any?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did you crawl out from, poor guy? Is this your first time in Elf City? You didn't even prepare for the entry fee?" the other added, a mocking tone in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously, if you're broke, you might as well turn around and go back where you came from! Don't waste our time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sneered, shooting Osborne a scornful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury bubbled within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How dare they call me a poor guy? I can easily return with billions of Celestial Crystals and toss them at these two like confetti!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he bit his tongue, choosing not to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his first time in Elf City, and he didn't want to stir up trouble in a place like this. Who knew what consequences could follow?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided to keep a low profile and assess the situation before making any rash moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, he didn't want to risk a confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Elf guards, while looking like mere gatekeepers, were actually formidable opponents at Ascension Four Supernal Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without using his absolute forbidden zone, he wasn't confident he could take them on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that the rulers of Elf City stationed two Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings at the entrance spoke volumes about their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne dared to cause a scene, he could easily find himself facing a horde of Ascension Five, Six, or even Seven or Eight Supernal Deity Kings, ready to turn him into a pile of shredded meat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne swallowed his anger and ignored the taunts from the Elf guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he couldn't speak their language, he could still communicate through soul resonance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gentlemen, It's really my first time here. I genuinely didn't know I needed Celestial Crystals for entry. Is there anything else I could offer instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards exchanged glances, their expressions still unimpressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You come here unprepared and expect to gain entry? You're just asking for death! If you don't have Celestial Crystals, you could use Sacred Crystals instead! Just one Sacred Crystal will grant you VIP status in Elf City, and you won't have to pay an entry fee again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But given that you don't even have Celestial Crystals, I doubt you have any Sacred Crystals either! Alternatively, we accept Miracle Elixirs as well&mdash;ten of those will get you in for a year. After that, you'll need to keep providing ten more every year to stay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief upon hearing this.</span></p></div>
