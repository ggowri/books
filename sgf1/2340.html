        <h1>Chapter 2279 Power Rankings-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just five days to go until the state duel, the Zephyr State authorities rolled out their official power rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The list featured a thousand participants who were set to take part in the state duel, ranked based on the strength they'd shown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, since they hadn't actually faced off against each other yet, the rankings were a bit subjective. However, the state duel power rankings could still give some idea about the strength of the competitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the list came out, it landed in the hands of every major power, fueling even more heated discussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Number One in the State Duel Power Ranking&mdash;Agatha Woolley!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Agatha hails from the First-rate Power, Resurgent Throne Palace. She's one of their top disciples, holding a high position even within the palace. She has the blood of the ancient phoenix running through her veins. The phoenix is a legendary divine beast, also known as the immortal bird and the king of all birds, capable of rising from its own ashes. She entered the Frosty River City duel as an independent contestant and ended up steamrolling all her opponents to clinch the Frosty River City championship!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Word on the street is that Agatha has already fused three powers. Her Sacred Power is off the charts, and she's mastered the Sacred Artifact, the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute, to perfection. When she plays the melody, it'll put anyone who listens into a trance. She's a force to be reckoned with all on her own. Even though the state duel is a wild territory battle and she doesn't have a strong team by her side, she's bound to shine and take the state duel championship&mdash;all she needs is a bit of luck!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Coming in at Number Two on the State Duel Power Ranking is Horace Steinbeck!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Horace also hails from the First-rate Power, Chilling Nether Palace. He entered the Cloudia City duel as an independent contestant and won without a shadow of a doubt. He's also mastered a Sacred Artifact, the Frost-invoking Canvas, to the fullest. When he waves it, it can freeze thousands of miles in an instant, making him virtually unbeatable. He's a one-man wrecking crew!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Rumor has it that he, too, has fused three powers, making his strength on par with Agatha's. It'll take a direct showdown to see who's the stronger of the two.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Either way, there's no question that Horace will make a name for himself in the state duel. He and Agatha are destined to become powerhouses across the Glorious Divine Kingdom...]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Number Three on the State Duel Power Ranking is Broderick Swinburne!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Broderick hails from the First-rate Power, Fiery Volcanic Isle...]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Number Four on the State Duel Power Ranking is Benson Smollett!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Number Five...]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the large training ground of the Mystic Sirius Sect, an Elder hung the state duel power rankings up high so that the disciples could take a look and have a chat about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, hurry up and check! See where Osborne ranks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given Osborne's strength, he must be in the top fifty! Maybe he even has a chance to be in the top thirty! After all, Osborne easily beat Leroy, Clara, and the others in the Tempest Fortress City duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, where on earth is he..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect quickly scanned the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't among the top ten. The disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect thought it was to be expected. After all, almost all the top-ten contenders hailed from the three First-rate Powers&mdash;the Chilling Nether Palace, the Resurgent Throne Palace, and the Fiery Volcanic Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading about the powers of those people on the list, the members of the Mystic Sirius Sect were left slack-jawed and deeply shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their strength was simply off the charts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them had not only blended three distinct forces together but also had complete mastery of Sacred Artifacts. They wield these artifacts with such finesse that it's like they were born to use them.</span></p></div>
