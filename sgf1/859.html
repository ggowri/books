        <h1>Chapter 859 Defeat With One Move</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent glared at Clarissa, his anger simmering just beneath the surface.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the challenge, she quickly composed herself; after all, she was here to test her mettle and improve her combat skills.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Vincent wanted a fight, she'd gladly accept.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine by me!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to fight, let's do it!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's eyes sparkled with a predatory gleam as a smug grin spread across his face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Perfect! Clarissa, I'll easily take you down, and then I'll move on to finish off Osborne! I'll show everyone that I'm the best heir of the Augustine family!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he finished his taunt, a fight concluded in one of the arenas.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without a moment's hesitation, he dashed up to the platform, calling out, "Clarissa, come and face me!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa maintained her calm demeanor as she walked toward the arena with steady steps.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clarissa!" Yulissa called, worry etched across her face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was concerned about Clarissa's abilities; after all, they didn't know how she'd fare against someone like Vincent, a Class AAA fighter. Osborne had asked them to look after her, and the thought of her getting bullied by Vincent left Yulissa uneasy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's fine. I can handle this," Clarissa assured her, flashing a reassuring smile before stepping into the arena.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she entered, the crowd erupted with excitement, captivated by her striking beauty. All eyes were on her, and the other two battles were quickly forgotten.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who is she?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What a stunning girl!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't believe I've never heard of her before. Is she taken? A beauty like that at such a young age and already at Class AA strength?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think her opponent is Vincent from the Augustine family. He's Class AAA."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This just got interesting!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whispers and murmurs rippled through the crowd; concern etched on Yulissa and Kendra's faces.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's Class AAA status put him at a clear advantage, and they worried Clarissa might get hurt.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Clarissa stood resolute.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought to herself, "Sure, I lost to Ebony, but that was because I was inexperienced in real combat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If I had made the first move against her Realm, the outcome could have been different.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony ranked 398 on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent may also be Class AAA, but he lacks any notable achievements; he isn't even on the rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He's hardly a threat."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent, reveling in the attention, didn't rush into the fight. Instead, he sneered, saying, "Clarissa, your taste is really questionable. You actually chose to be with someone like Osborne?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gasps erupted from the audience at his words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait, she's Osborne's girlfriend?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This Honor Quest Ceremony is supposed to center around him. I heard his strength is pretty average. This could easily turn into a public humiliation for him. I came here just for the spectacle!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who knew his girlfriend would be such a knockout?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If only I could snag her for myself!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha! Osborne doesn't deserve someone like her! Once she sees how much better the real talent is, she'll definitely ditch him."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've already foreseen that."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Laughter and bold comments flew around, leaving Yulissa and Kendra seething with anger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa, too, felt the heat of fury boiling within her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shot a fierce glare at Vincent, knowing he had deliberately brought up her relationship with Osborne just to provoke the crowd.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent, basking in his own arrogance, chuckled. "Oh, Clarissa, did you hear that? You're so stunning and so talented at such a young age. Osborne simply doesn't measure up to you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa let out a scornful huff, her patience wearing thin. "You're becoming more revolting by the second! What does it matter to you whether Osborne is good enough for me? He's incredible, and he's deserving of anyone!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that declaration, a pair of immense Divine and Demonic Wings erupted from her back, majestic and fearsome.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One wing shimmered with a pure, radiant white while the other was shrouded in eerie black.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They spread wide, reaching a staggering 66 feet, transforming Clarissa's already stunning figure into something divine, captivating the crowd's attention and leaving them spellbound.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every gaze turned toward her, eyes wide and filled with admiration.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow, she's breathtaking!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent was momentarily stunned, his jaw slack as he took in the sight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he was about to retort, Clarissa said, "Enough talk! Let's fight!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, you want to fight? Bring it on! I'm not scared of you! I'm going to wipe the floor with you, and make sure Osborne feels every bit of your defeat!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without another word, he lunged forward, ready to attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa, fueled by anger and determination, did not hold back. Her lovely face was a mask of fury as those colossal wings soared and swept toward Vincent with relentless force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, his attack shattered, and Clarissa's wings sent him flying, blood spraying as he soared through the air before crashing hard onto the arena floor below.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the dust settled, Clarissa looked down at him with disdain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that all you got? You dare to challenge me? You don't even come close to being as good as a single hair on Osborne's head! Pathetic!"</p></div>
