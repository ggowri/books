        <h1>Chapter 2478 Lionel's Methods-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel thought for a moment and felt Osborne's proposal was reasonable, then nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two kept a distance between them. He threw the Void Sword in one direction, while Osborne tossed the Kingdom Duel Badge in the other. With their respective speeds, they could only choose to pick up one item.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he chose the Kingdom Duel Badge, he would have to give up the Void Sword, allowing Osborne to easily obtain the Void Sword. Conversely, if he decided to go after the Void Sword, Osborne would have the chance to retrieve the Kingdom Duel Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this situation, each of them could obtain one item, completing the deal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're quite cautious!" Lionel sneered inwardly. "But you're still too young! You have no idea how many tricks a warrior who has cultivated for tens of thousands of years at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection level possesses! The Kingdom Duel Badge is mine. And you won't take the Void Sword either. Once you throw out the Kingdom Duel Badge, your death will follow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite plotting this in his heart, Lionel's face revealed no flaws.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Let's begin. Before those people catch up, let's finish the deal quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement. "Alright! I'll start the countdown. I will throw the Kingdom Duel Badge to your left. And you, please throw the Void Sword to your right. If I notice you throwing in the wrong direction or playing any tricks, I will immediately use spatial power to retrieve the Kingdom Duel Badge and rush into the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, no matter what you say, I won't believe you anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel looked serious and said earnestly, "Don't worry, I just want the Kingdom Duel Badge. With it, I can buy several supreme Sacred Artifacts. I won't play any tricks!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne responded, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Two!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment the countdown ended, Osborne threw the Kingdom Duel Badge toward Lionel's left side. At the same time, he saw Lionel toss the Void Sword in another direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this step, Lionel didn</span><span>'</span><span>t play any tricks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly dashed toward the Void Sword, while Lionel, without hesitation, burst into his fastest speed, heading straight for the Kingdom Duel Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both moved incredibly fast, but overall, Osborne was quicker since he possessed spatial power. With one interdimensional travel, he reached the Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Osborne grabbed the Void Sword, he immediately felt a violent and sharp force erupting from it. His palm was instantly covered with fine wounds, blood streaming down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face was full of shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What immense power! With my current cultivation level and strength, I can't control this Void Sword at all. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, this </span><span>wa</span><span>s a supreme Sacred Artifact, and not the severely damaged type like the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, but a perfectly intact Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if </span><span>he</span><span> br</span><span>oke</span><span> through to Empyrean Sacredness, </span><span>he </span><span>might not fully control it, let alone unleash its full power, and </span><span>he</span><span> could even suffer a backlash!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne decided to put away the Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, he suddenly sensed a powerful force of resistance emanating from the Void Sword. This force was so intense that he couldn't store it in the Dimensional Space or Satan Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression changed instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Lionel really tampered with the Void Sword. Although he erased his mark on the sword, he left behind other mysterious forces. This not only prevents me from controlling the Void Sword but also from storing it in the Dimensional Space. Truly a clever tactic!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the power erupting from the Void Sword had left Osborne's palm covered in wounds. Helpless, he could only temporarily throw the sword away.</span></p></div>
