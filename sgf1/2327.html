        <h1>Chapter 2271 The Power of a Sacred Artifact-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the arrow shadows vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd from Azure Haven Academy burst into cheers anew, but they missed the slight frown that crossed Leroy's face. Her hand on the Inferno Drake Lance started to quiver ever so slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a scoff. "After firing off two such bone-crushing attacks in quick succession, your Sacred Power must be on its last legs. You're no Empyrean Sacredness warrior; you're just an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King! I bet your Sacred Power won't hold out much longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle at Leroy's jibe. "Is that so</span><span>?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What went unnoticed by everyone was the invisible roots sprouting from Osborne. They bored deep into the void around them, sucking up energy like a vacuum to refill his rapidly dwindling Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy wasn't completely off the mark; he wasn't a full-fledged Empyrean Sacredness warrior. He was just an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King. Even though he could tap into Sacred Power, his reserves weren't exactly bottomless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks were taking a huge toll on his energy stores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, Osborne would quickly run out of Sacred Power and his strength would take a nosedive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had an ace up his sleeve&mdash;the Chaotic Spiritual Root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This incredible ability was like the might of the World Tree, enabling him to suck energy out of the void whenever he wanted. So, he never had to fret about running out of steam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go for round two!" Osborne announced, pulling back the string of his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he placed a single arrow on it that looked like a strange dark ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Dimensional Maw!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once his most devastating attack, it had taken Osborne ages and a whole lot of mental sweat to incorporate it into his archery skills. If it weren't for his extraordinary talent, he'd never have pulled it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with this technique imbued in the arrow, its power was off the charts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weird arrow zipped forward and appeared right in front of Leroy in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, it unleashed a terrifying gravitational pull that made Leroy stumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her confidence wavered as a sense of impending doom washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Inferno Drake Lance! Break it!" she roared, her expression turning grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting her teeth, she poured her Sacred Power into the spear and thrust it forward with all her might, aiming to smash that menacing arrow to bits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash of the two forces sent shockwaves rippling through the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The void around them shattered like delicate glass. The sheer might of the impact was catastrophic, causing everything in its path to collapse and crumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Leroy felt the Inferno Drake Lance being yanked towards the arrow, as if it had been caught in a powerful whirlpool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard she struggled, she couldn't move the spear. The overwhelming force was closing in on her, threatening to swallow her whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Leroy gasped, panic flashing across her face for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She summoned every ounce of her strength in a desperate bid to resist, but it was all in vain. Blood spurted from her mouth as she was violently hurled backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy's body crashed onto the arena floor, creating a huge crater on impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! This can't be real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split-second, the top-brass from Azure Haven Academy shot up from their seats. The shock was clearly written all over their faces as they watched Leroy go down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd below, which had been a sea of passionate supporters just moments ago, fell into stunned silence, their faces contorted in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Leroy? Defeated?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't wrap their heads around it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could she, armed with the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance, possibly lose? She </span><span style="font-style: italic;">was</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">supposed to steamroll Osborne easily, overwhelming him with brute force and clinching the championship without a shadow of a doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they were seeing the unthinkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the Inferno Drake Lance burst into fearsome flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blazing dragon took shape, sweeping away the collapsing energy around it and charging straight towards the crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, a blood-smeared arm reached out from the pit and firmly grasped the Inferno Drake Lance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a ferocious roar, Leroy rocketed out of the crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flames danced around her body, and her eyes blazed with unbridled fury. "You son of a bitch! How dare you make me look like such a loser! I'll never forgive you for this! You're </span><span>gonna</span><span> pay the price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Inferno Drake Lance, annihilate!"</span><span> </span></p></div>
