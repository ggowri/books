        <h1>Chapter 1529 Nearly</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The petals of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, now absorbing the pure high-grade death scent, were rapidly regaining vitality, becoming increasingly plump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that the Lotus had recovered about ninety-nine percent of its strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so close to being fully restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All it needed was to bloom again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the main mine, plenty of high-grade death scent still lingered in the air. Osborne was confident that this would be enough for the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to complete its recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He silently anticipated the moment when the Lotus would fully revive, its petals unfurling to reveal the Dimensional Microcosm hidden within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would mean he could reconnect with Sebastian, Anastasia, Bryce, Kendra, Divine Shadow, Mila, and the members of the Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been worried about them for far too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, once the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was fully restored, he would gain its protection, achieving complete immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, nothing could stand in his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Osborne thought the petals were on the verge of blooming, they hesitated, refusing to open. In that instant, the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity abruptly stopped absorbing the high-grade death scent from the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mine was still filled with plenty of this precious substance, yet the Lotus ceased its consumption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?" Osborne furrowed his brow, an uneasy feeling creeping into his gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a message resonated from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, leaving him stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To fully restore itself, the Lotus needs to bloom again, but the high-grade death scent isn't enough. It requires the death scent liquid left behind by a Deity King-level Deathborn to complete its recovery?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you kidding me? You want me to take down a Deity King-level Deathborn? That's impossible! With my current strength, I can barely handle a Deity Overlord-level Deathborn. When I'm surrounded by two of them, all I can do is run!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing a Deity King-level Deathborn? No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between the Deity Overlord and Deity King is enormous. Breaking through to Deity King involves a complete transformation&mdash;a leap in the level of existence! Even if I manage to reach Transcendent Deity level or even Celestial Deity level and could easily wipe the floor with any peak Deity Overlord, going up against a Deity King? That's a whole different ballgame!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His frown deepened as he realized the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like there's no way I can get that death scent liquid on my own in the near future. I'll have to rely on other forces!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, there aren't any Deity King-level Deathborn lurking around Wild Flame City. They only show up at divine peaks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Peak Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to figure out a way to get to Divine Peak Nine. That's where the Deity King-level Deathborn hang out. Luckily, I can enlist the help of the Wild Flame Army to take one down and get the death scent liquid I need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, Anastasia, just hang on a little longer! I promise I'll do everything I can to restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and bring you back from the Dimensional Microcosm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne quickly regained his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity hadn't completed its full restoration and Osborne hadn't achieved his goal, the situation wasn't without its rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the lotus had recovered about ninety-nine percent of its vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bond between Osborne and the Lotus was once again strengthened. While it couldn't grant him complete immortality yet, it could definitely help him recover his injuries quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he wasn't killed outright, the lotus' current state would ensure that he could bounce back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder if this Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity can help heal Darren and the others? Well, I guess there's only one way to find out!" Osborne thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Hannah's voice broke through his contemplation. "Lachlan, what were you just thinking about? Your</span><span> don't look good</span><span>! Are you hurt? Do you want me to use my life power to help you recover?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked up to see Hannah gazing at him with genuine concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but smile a bit, saying, "I'm fine, just thinking about some stuff."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced around the area. "We've cleaned out all the Deathborn, right? Those two Deity Overlord-level Deathborns must have been the reason so many gathered here in the first place. With them gone, we shouldn't see a massive influx of Deathborn anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah studied Osborne's face carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she was sure he wasn't hurt, she let out a sigh of relief. "Lachlan, I need to thank you. If it weren't for you, I would have been done for back there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she said this, a blush crept onto her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, have you ever thought about marrying into the Gellar family?"</span></p></div>
