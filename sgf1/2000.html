        <h1>Chapter 1995 The Miracle Never Came-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Victory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Victory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Victory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a deafening cheer erupted from the Dark Deity Legion. Despite there being fewer than ten Unity Clan warriors still standing on the arena, a win was a win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The victors deserved every ounce of the applause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, the Human Community, the losers, had no time to mourn. There were still four more matches to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And these next battles? They were about to get a whole lot more serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of the fighters stepping into the ring next were Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the West Zone Human Community&mdash;billions strong, with trillions of fighters from all walks of life&mdash;the higher levels of Deity power like Transcendent Deities, Celestial Deities, and Deity Overlords weren't all that rare. Losing a few here and there wouldn't make much of a dent. Heck, a few deaths wouldn't even shake things up too much. But Supernal Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, that was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were so few of them. Losing one of them would be a devastating blow for the Human Community right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The upcoming battles between the Supernal Deity Kings? If they played out like the earlier matches, with one side getting wiped out completely...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would be a loss no one could bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for the Unity Clan, losing too many Supernal Deity Kings on the arena would be a crushing blow, one that might not be easy to bounce back from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, yeah. The upcoming Supernal Deity King battles? They were make-or-break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The losers? They'd feel the pain, deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready for battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span>'s voice was as cold as ice, her expression unreadable, like the earlier defeat hadn't left a mark on her. But if you looked closely, really looked into her eyes, you'd catch the flicker of sorrow and fury lurking deep within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, no matter how angry she was, the fights had to go on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because if they didn't, the Dark Deity Legion would launch a full-scale assault. With the difference in their forces, every second would mean a hundred, a thousand more deaths for the Human Community than what was happening on the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the grand scheme, sacrificing a few to delay the inevitable war is worth it," </span><span>God of Light</span><span> kept telling herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes hardened, her voice dropping low, "Listen up. Get word to your fighters. For the upcoming battles between the Supernal Deity Kings, I have one request: it's not about winning. It's about... surviving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is going to be a long, drawn-out contest," she continued, her tone unyielding. "We, the Human Community, can lose these fights. We can retreat and fall back to protect the line&mdash;consider it a strategic retreat, buying time. But we can't afford more unnecessary losses. If we can't win, we surrender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hung heavy in the air, a weight that silenced the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite the gravity of it all, the group didn't hesitate. They got to work, immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of the hundred Supernal Deity Kings from Ascension One stepping into the ring next, half of them were from the leading factions. Their leaders swiftly passed on </span><span>God of Light</span><span>'s orders to the fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other half? They were from the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sanctum of Light was one of only two Sanctum-Level Powers in the Human Community&mdash;far stronger than Dukedom-Level Powers. Most of the Supernal Deity Kings fighting next would be from this faction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span> had given them their orders too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do your best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it's too much, surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, the fifth battle began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both sides had a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings, and while the numbers were a hundred times fewer than before, the intensity of the battle was no less&mdash;if anything, it was even fiercer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the viewing platform, the sky and earth seemed to shake as Divine Ascendance Technique exploded in every direction. The air was thick with energy, and countless warriors from the Human Community and the Dark Deity Legion watched in stunned silence, their faces filled with awe and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For many of them, this was their first time witnessing a fight between Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this wasn't just any fight&mdash;it was a massive brawl between two hundred of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash of unimaginable forces, the terrifying blasts of energy, the bizarre and deadly techniques, the sheer vitality that fueled these beings&mdash;it was all unfolding before their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the Human Community lost the battle.</span></p></div>
