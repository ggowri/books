        <h1>Chapter 2291 The Terrifying Fourth Layer-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! How could it be this terrifying?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this is just the fourth layer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm ranked 260th on the power rankings, but I feel like I can barely last an hour or two in the fourth layer before I gotta bail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can only hang on for half an hour!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was chatting a mile a minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who could still spare the energy to talk were considered to have some decent chops. Most of them were pouring all their power into resisting the bone-chilling gales of the fourth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those ranked in the top hundred were relatively at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, folks like Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson, who were in the top twenty, didn't even bother with any defenses. They were just relying on their own brute physical strength to tough out the terrifying cold winds of the fourth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disparity in strength was as clear as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert had said earlier that only one or two hundred people would be able to search for tokens in the fourth layer. The rest would only be able to stay there for a short while before getting frozen solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now it looked like he wasn't pulling anyone's leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, even Clara had summoned her Sacred Power for defense and was frowning like there was no tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't bat an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His physical body was so tough that the cold winds might as well have been a gentle breeze. There was no way they could freeze or hurt him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, since only those ranked around the top twenty weren't using any defenses, Osborne didn't want to stick out like a sore thumb. So, Osborne also put up a defense, pretending that his body couldn't take the cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Clara and asked, "How are you holding up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara looked serious and shook her head. "Not good! The cold winds in the fourth layer are a real beast. I gotta use my Sacred Power to fend them off, and it's getting drained every second. At this rate, I'm gonna run out of juice in a few hours! Then I'll have to hightail it out of the fourth layer and head back to the third."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne frowned a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a real pain in the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara looked at Osborne and asked, "What about you? How're you feeling? This kind of cold wind should be a piece of cake for you, and your Sacred Power shouldn't be draining fast, right? You should be able to stay in the fourth layer all day, shouldn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a nod. "I'm doing just fine here! Staying in the fourth layer for as long as it takes is no biggie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Clara felt a twinge of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry about this! I'm cramping your style. When the state duel kicks off for real, you should stay in the fourth layer and hunt for tokens. Once my Sacred Power is all topped up, I'll head up here to search too. When the power drain gets too much, I'll head back down to the third layer, looking for tokens and recharging my Sacred Power at the same time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a smile. "Hey, we're a team! There's no such thing as one person slowing the other down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Rupert's power washed over everyone there, and the biting force of the cold wind was instantly gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grinned and said, "So, how'd you guys like the fourth layer? Now, if you feel like you can't handle it, you'd better hightail it back to the third layer right away! And if you're up for the challenge of the fifth layer, you can stick around!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he'd finished speaking, a bunch of folks in the crowd decided to beat a retreat from the fourth layer and head back to the third, taking a good look at their own abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if they couldn't even stand up to the cold wind of the fourth layer, there was no point in going to the fifth layer. It'd only end up with them looking like a bunch of losers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, only around three hundred people stuck around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was one of them. Even though she knew it'd be an uphill battle for her to make it in the fifth layer, she was still itching to give it a shot and see how the others were holding up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to find out just how big the gap was between her and them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert declared, "Alright then! Let's head on up to the fifth layer right now!"</span></p></div>
