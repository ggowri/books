        <h1>Chapter 1637 Furious Athena</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Reporting to Ms. Athena Huntington, I'm here to submit my mission report," Osborne said flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At his words, Athena's expression darkened further. She clenched her fists tightly, her divine power rippling around her, as if she might explode with rage at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just moments ago, she had received the devastating news&mdash;Emmett was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emmett and Diana's mining team had been attacked by a powerful group of Deathborn in the 53rd mining area. Emmett, along with seventeen elite Celestial Deity guards, had perished under the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only survivors were Riley and two other Deity Overlords, along with Osborne and Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What infuriated Athena the most was that while the three Deity Overlords had returned severely injured, Osborne and Diana&mdash;two members of the Human Community&mdash;had emerged unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she heard the news, disbelief washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it hadn't come from Riley, who was from the Soaring Lion Clan and had strong ties with the Huntington family, she would have thought she misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had assigned Osborne to protect Emmett, hoping that Emmett and Riley would eliminate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, Emmett died, and Osborne walked away without a scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a bitter pill for Athena to swallow, and she felt utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a cold huff, she said, "I'm fully aware of what happened. Your mission was to protect Emmett, and he died during the Deathborn attack. As a member of the guard, you failed to protect him, which means your mission is a failure. You won't receive any Merit Points."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shrugged at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Merit Points were crucial for exchanging accomplishments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to base regulations, every mission had a guaranteed Merit Point reward based on difficulty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had been tasked with protecting Emmett and Diana in a high-risk area, so if he had completed the mission successfully, he would have earned at least five hundred Merit Points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One thousand Merit Points could be exchanged for a third-class merit, ten thousand for a second-class merit, one hundred thousand for a first-class merit, and a million for a special merit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For most, Merit Points were vital and directly tied to their promotions and career advancement. That was why they risked their lives to complete various missions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To become a chiliarch, one needed to reach the Celestial Deity level and earn at least one third-class merit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To become a leader of ten thousand, a second-class merit was required.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To achieve the rank of brigadier general, one needed first-class merit, and to become a general, at least one special merit or ten first-class merits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, Merit Points were extremely important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for Osborne, they were not a priority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While he had ambitions, he didn't care much about five hundred points. There would be plenty of opportunities to earn more in the future, especially since killing Deathborn also awarded Merit Points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Taking down a Celestial Deity-level Deathborn earned a hundred Merit Points, while a Deity Overlord-level Deathborn brought in a thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne's strength, accumulating Merit Points was hardly a challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here, the real struggle was simply surviving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If there's nothing else, I'm going to head back and rest. According to the rules, I only need to complete two missions a month, so I'll be taking the next two weeks off. I'd appreciate it if you don't bother me during that time, Ms. Athena Huntington," Osborne stated calmly before turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Athena's fists tightened again, her fury palpable, but she found herself at a loss for what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every member of the base was only required to complete two missions a month&mdash;one every week&mdash;leaving them with half the month for downtime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even as his superior, there was nothing she could do to force him into another mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne strutted out of the room, Athena's rage erupted. With a powerful blow, she smashed her palm down on the table, splintering it to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! Osborne, you worthless Human Community scum, just you wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I, Athena, will make you pay! You might have escaped this time, but I won't believe you can dodge fate again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next time you take on a mission, you won't be a rookie anymore. I'll assign you to something much more dangerous, and then you'll be as good as dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I can't kill you, then I'm not worthy of the name Athena!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After her angry tirade, Athena took a moment to compose herself, her mind racing as she plotted her next move against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Athena's mind churned with scheming thoughts. "What kind of task can I set him up with to ensure his demise? Maybe an exploration mission...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How about sending him to Divine Peak Nine? The mortality rate for those exploring Divine Peak Nine is over ninety percent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There's no way Osborne will come back from that! But still... ninety percent isn't quite enough. If he's lucky again, it'll only make it harder to deal with him in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wait! I can throw that cursed woman into the mix! Have her accompany Osborne to Divine Peak Nine! She nearly got a Deity King warrior killed the last time she went!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There's no way Osborne will survive with her in the team!"</span></p></div>
