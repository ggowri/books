        <h1>Chapter 185 Confession?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was puzzled. "Since Skyefall Security dared to propose a 10-billion-dollar gamble, they must be confident, right? Aunt Donna, why are you so sure that Chevalier Security will win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was equally puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. Skyefall Security was once the top security company. Even if Chevalier Security stole most of its bodyguards, its strength should not be underestimated. I don't think Chevalier Security will win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna shook her head. "You both underestimate Apollo and the Chevalier family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he wasn't sure, how could Apollo agree? Although he is proud and impulsive, he is not stupid. Even if the Chevalier family loses a gamble of 10 billion dollars, they will definitely suffer heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Apollo must have been confident before he agreed. And I heard that Apollo brought back a group of mysterious strongmen from abroad this time. Each of them is experienced in many battles and terrifyingly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, these men will participate tonight's battle! Apollo is a genuine Class B metahuman and knows how to use Fusion Skill. I can't imagine how Chevalier Security will lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Clarissa opened her mouth slightly, worry showing on her pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, do you hope Skyefall Security will win?" asked Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip and did not answer. Instead, she said to Osborne, "Osborne, can you walk with me in the garden? I have something to tell you alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was about to stop them, but she suddenly remembered the bet between her and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the agreement, she could not stop Osborne from pursuing Clarissa and even had to help them. So, she immediately held back her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to hang out over there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Donna left in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Barlyn couldn't help but wink at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are really something, dude!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be nice to Clarissa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn finished speaking in a low voice. Osborne blushed and quickly pushed Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please leave! I have a few bottles of wine in the trunk of my car. They are specially prepared for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne handed the car key to Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn became excited instantly when he heard that and took the key before running away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne touched his nose and quickly caught up with Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two walked silently in the garden, and no one spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, Clarissa suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned around slowly, staring at Osborne with her beautiful eyes, and said seriously, "Osborne, I don't want to marry Apollo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing Clarissa wanted to talk to him about this, although he didn't know why, he was happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly asked, "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I hate him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, her face full of sorrow. "Ever since I was a kid, people said that I am the Fatebearer of the Radcliffe family and that I carry the fate of the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The one who marries me will succeed! The prerequisite is that he must be outstanding enough, have a strong background and power, and be a favored guy of God with great luck. Otherwise, if he marries me, he will surely die tragically, and the Radcliffe family will decline!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, the elders chose Apollo..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to Clarissa's words, Osborne looked at her in great surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Fatebearer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remembered that when Godfather had assigned the test of succession, he had said several times that Clarissa was the Fatebearer of the Radcliffe family. At that time, Osborne hadn't understood what the Fatebearer was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he finally understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the eldest son of the Chevalier family, Apollo had a strong background and influence, and he was also outstanding enough. To the elders of the Radcliffe family, only Apollo could bear Clarissa's fate power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Clarissa was engaged to Apollo!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they got married, Apollo would use Clarissa's fate power to become the most powerful person in Rosmandi. He would also lead the Radcliffe family to become more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "I see!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder the Radcliffe family is in a hurry to marry Clarissa to Apollo, and Apollo is also in a hurry to marry Clarissa! It is all because of her fate power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a bit curious at this moment about why Clarissa told him this. Did Clarissa think that he had a way to change all this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa still stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "Osborne, do you know why I suddenly ran away from home fifteen years ago? Because the elders in my family made me engage with Apollo that year!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I didn't like Apollo the first time I saw him! I hated him, but I couldn't resist it, so I ran away from home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm glad I did it because I met you! The first time I saw you, I felt you were different. Although you looked like a little beggar and were dirty all over, I didn't hate you at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, I was thinking how great it would be if I could marry you, Osborne, instead of Apollo when I grow up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, Clarissa suddenly blushed and lowered her head slightly as if she didn't dare to look Osborne in the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she suppressed her shyness and looked up at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth wide in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Is Clarissa telling me she loves me?"</span></p></div>
