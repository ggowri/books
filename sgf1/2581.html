        <h1>Chapter 2476 The Enemy Also Fears-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this time, due to being too focused on chasing Osborne, he unknowingly approached this forbidden area. When he realized it, he instinctively chose to move away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, there was still some distance between him and the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign. The suction coming from it was not strong and had almost no effect on him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as he didn't actively fly into it, there shouldn't be any problems.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, he coldly said to Osborne, "Now, hand over your Kingdom Duel Badge! Give me all your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. Considering I'm in a relatively good mood today, I might spare your life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who is this Lionel?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He tried to recall but couldn't remember this person. He wasn't sure if it was because he had never heard of the name or if the other party had deliberately used a fake name.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, this person's appearance was also disguised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although his disguise was extremely convincing, in Osborne's Satan's Eye, all disguises were futile. Osborne had already seen his true appearance. As long as he managed to survive this time, Osborne would eventually uncover this person's true identity and seek revenge when the opportunity arose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, what he should do most is to escape the current predicament.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Lionel's words, Osborne took out his Kingdom Duel Badge and looked at the long number on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forty-six billion is indeed a fortune that lingers in one's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was merely a small figure who had not yet reached Empyrean Sacredness, yet he possessed such immense wealth. In this strength-driven world, where warriors could trample on rules and laws at will, it seemed unreasonable that no one had targeted him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ultimately, it was because his strength was lacking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel spoke coldly, "I'll give you ten more seconds! Hand over your Kingdom Duel Badge within ten seconds, and I might spare your life. If you still refuse after ten seconds, don't blame me for taking action. To be honest, I am at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. Killing you would be as easy as crushing an ant!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't even think about stalling for time, waiting for others to catch up, and then using our fight to escape in the chaos. I won't give you such a chance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand over the Kingdom Duel Badge immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Or I'll kill you right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A chilling, bone-piercing killing intent suddenly erupted from Lionel, surging like a tide and pressing down on Osborne. Even without any tangible force impact, Osborne felt a faint pain on his skin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were an ordinary Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, under such terrifying killing intent, they would likely be too frightened to speak, possibly even dropping to their knees to beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne merely let out a cold laugh and mocked, "You want me to hand over the Kingdom Duel Badge willingly? Do you think that's possible? If you have the guts, come and take it! Even if I bring the Kingdom Duel Badge into the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, I will never give it to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne immediately took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sped off in the direction of the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Lionel's expression changed drastically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He roared angrily, "Stop right there! Entering the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign will surely get you killed. Even I wouldn't survive. Stop now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne would not stop because of this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel instantly became anxious. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne really charges into the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, it</span><span>'</span><span>ll be a huge problem. Osborne will definitely die, and the Kingdom Duel Badge will be lost inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with my strength, I wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t dare to recklessly go in and search.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll gain nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne getting closer to the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, Lionel gritted his teeth and cursed under his breath, "Damn it! You want to die? Not that easy! Even if you</span><span>'</span><span>re going to die, hand over the Kingdom Duel Badge first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Lionel rushed toward Osborne at an astonishing speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had to stop Osborne and seize the Kingdom Duel Badge before he was completely locked and dragged in by the pulling force of the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne and Lionel, one after the other, rapidly approached the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign. Osborne could clearly feel the pulling force growing stronger as the distance shortened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had to frantically channel Sacred Power just to barely resist the pull of this force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he got any closer, his body would lose control and be firmly locked by the power of the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, forcibly dragged inside!</span></p></div>
