        <h1>Chapter 1430 A Pathetic Human</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, you're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Elroy's squad members finally snapped into action. As they saw their leader sent flying by Osborne's slap and still struggling to get back on his feet, their anger boiled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight members, including the injured three, quickly surrounded Osborne, their faces twisted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, apologize to our captain right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, you're dead meat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lowly human scum, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shouted at Osborne, expecting him to cower in fear. But in the blink of an eye, Osborne moved. He flashed in front of the loudest one and kicked him hard, sending him crashing backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These squad members were merely at the Superior Deity level, and their Transcendent Deity captain had already been knocked around by Osborne's earlier attack. Without a Malevolence Amulet to protect them, they stood no chance against his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kicked member coughed up blood, his Divine Body nearly cracking under the force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't tempered his strength, that kick would have turned him into a bloody mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glared at the fallen member and said coolly, "Idiot! I'm the captain here, and my rank in the Wild Flame Army is way above yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are to talk to me like that? Even if I killed you, you wouldn't have a leg to stand on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he shot a chilling glance at the other seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They froze, caught off guard by the icy intensity of his gaze. A shiver ran down their spines as a flicker of fear crept into their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you dare surround me again, I'll take it as an act of rebellion and won't hesitate to kill!" Osborne warned, his voice cold and unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seven members recoiled instinctively, their fear palpable as they stepped back, no longer willing to encircle Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers around them were equally stunned, exchanging bewildered glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could see the stark difference in "Lachlan" today; he seemed far more powerful and domineering than the timid figure they once knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did they realize the real Lachlan was gone, replaced by Osborne, who had fully regained his status as a Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready to unleash his fury on them, turning them into his Blood Clan. There was no more room for mercy; he would not tolerate any further humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan! You're going to pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Elroy finally managed to rise, his eyes blazing with fury as he glared at Osborne, his face flushed with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The humiliation of being slapped like a ragdoll still stung.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lowly human! I was careless before, but now, I'm going to kill you! You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elroy charged again, his divine power surging like a tidal wave. At that moment, he was a force to be reckoned with, far stronger than when he faced the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with all his might, he was no match for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne delivered a single kick that sent Elroy hurtling backward. The shield from Elroy's Malevolence Amulet shattered upon impact, and his Divine Body cracked, blood gushing from the wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could see Elroy had unleashed everything he had, and while they thought Osborne might be slightly stronger, they never expected this outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elroy was utterly defenseless against that single strike, crumpling to the ground, unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective intake of breath filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" At that moment, a cold scoff echoed through the cavern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey, who had been engaged with the Deathborn, turned away from the battle, positioning himself closer to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey cast a sharp glance at Osborne, then glanced down at Elroy, who lay prostrate on the ground, unable to move. Surprise mixed with killing intent flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, I need an explanation!" Jeffrey stated icily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne met his gaze without flinching. "Mr. Alick, what exactly do you want me to explain? Elroy insulted me first and threw the first punch. Considering we're on the same level, isn't it perfectly normal for me to retaliate? If he's too weak to handle it, that's his problem, not mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Elroy's squad members, they clearly don't know their place shouting at me like that. I thought teaching them a lesson was fair game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So tell me, what's there to explain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked straight at Jeffrey, the calmness in his demeanor only amplifying the weight of his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Jeffrey stood there dumbfounded, and so did everyone else around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all understood that Osborne had a point; his logic was sound, and his actions were defensible. But here's the catch: Osborne was a lowly member of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Wild Flame Army, the Human Community was regarded as the most pathetic race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the punching bags, the ones everyone felt entitled to bully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Traditionally, it was unheard of for a Human Community member to defy them, to argue back, to set any rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere idea of a human standing up and negotiating with them was absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeffrey finally regained his composure, his expression darkening. "Are you seriously trying to reason with me? You, a pathetic human, think you deserve to challenge me?"</span></p></div>
