        <h1>Chapter 666 Ranking First</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I transformed into Vampire before, my strength increased by about 50% to 80%. But now, I feel like my strength doubles after transforming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>murmured,</span><span> his eyes filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had previously wondered if the Blood Cross was truly a divine artifact since it only allowed him to transform into Vampire with no other apparent powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to other divine artifacts, the Blood Cross seemed too weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne had found a way to enhance the Blood Cross' power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absorb the enemy's blood energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more blood energy he absorbed, the stronger the Blood Cross would become, and the more it would boost him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne didn't waste any more time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He first burned Werewolf's body, then quickly returned to Titan's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, he gathered Titan's blood energy. He compressed it into blood beads, and absorbed it with his blood-red hair, instantly feeling the Blood Cross grow stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Medusa, and Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne collected all the enemies' blood energy and enhanced the Blood Cross, he felt its power temporarily overflow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excess power wasn't wasted. It was absorbed by Osborne's body, making him feel even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It can even enhance my body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was even more thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important thing was he now felt that his strength increased by 1.5 times when transforming into Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a powerful effect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that from now on, I must take the time after battles to collect the leftover blood energy from the battlefield. As long as there's enough blood energy, the Blood Cross can grow endlessly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that point, my Vampire transformation will be even stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After murmuring this, Osborne finally looked at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face showed tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Clarissa also retrieved the Trident of Poseidon from deep underground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Osborne, a smile appearing on her pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne looked disheveled, covered in blood like a bloodied figure, </span><span>Clarissa could sense the immense vitality within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he were an ancient beast, with life force far stronger than that of an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Clarissa wasn't too worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just touched and felt a bit sorry for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the battle scars around her, she could imagine how difficult and dangerous the fight had been. Osborne had to face five AAA-level powerhouses, all stronger than him, to protect her. It wasn't simply a miracle. It was an incredibly arduous process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa walked up to Osborne again and hugged him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, thank you! From now on, I'll fight alongside you and never let you face danger alone again!" Clarissa said, pressing her face against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa rested her face on Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held Clarissa's petite figure and smiled, nodding. "Sounds good! With you backing me up, I won't have to worry about getting hurt. Five AAA-level enemies, even ten. I'm confident I can outlast them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't bragging. He truly believed he could do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was already at the AA level, closer to the AAA level than him. She also had the Fate Staff and Trident of Poseidon, two divine artifacts. Even Osborne couldn't fathom how strong she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important thing was that she had Divine Healing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Clarissa behind him, ready to heal him at any time, he would be able to fight with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded firmly but soon became puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what happened while I was in seclusion? Why did those people attack you? Who are they?" Clarissa asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne calmly replied, "It's complicated. We'll talk as we walk. We must head to Campbell and meet up with Isaac and the others right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held Clarissa's hand and smiled. "The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> have taken over </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. They've already started a war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. We'll talk on the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they headed towards Campbell, Osborne explained everything that had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was completely shocked, struggling to process all the information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne had a moment to check the rankings of the Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne was surprised, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking down those five AAA-level </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, including Medusa, he gained 5,000 points. His total score was finally positive, reaching 3,000 points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he was ranked first on the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had pulled ahead of the second-place player, Vincent Augustine, by 2,000 points.</span></p></div>
