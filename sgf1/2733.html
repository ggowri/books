        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I admit defeat!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the final match, Osborne smiled at Leroy across from him and said with a grin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he finished speaking, the entire audience fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at Osborne, Clara, and Leroy in shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can it be played like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Clara faced Leroy, Leroy directly admitted defeat, and when Clara faced Osborne, Clara directly admitted defeat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone thought Osborne would easily win the championship when...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne faced Leroy, he actually...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Admitted defeat!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's right, in the final match, Osborne directly admitted defeat to Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this led to a strange outcome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Clara, and Leroy all ended up with the same record in the top five ranking battle...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three wins, one loss!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, their wins and losses formed a loop!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne lost to Leroy, Leroy lost to Clara, and Clara lost to Osborne...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, with identical records and the same win-loss relationships...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They will...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>become co-champions!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, all the spectators were stunned by Osborne's move. Everyone thought Osborne would be the champion, Clara the runner-up, and Leroy the third place, but then...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, facing Leroy's voluntary forfeit, directly made them co-champions!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>You should know, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel comes with rewards!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the rewards are extremely high, especially for this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. Since nine princes and princesses participated, the rewards are even greater than previous Glorious Divine Kingdom Duels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The champion is rewarded with 20 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The runner-up is rewarded with 10 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The third place is rewarded with 5 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fourth place is rewarded with 3 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fifth place is rewarded with 2 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sixth to tenth places are rewarded with 1 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tenth to twentieth places are rewarded with 500 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of the other participants is rewarded with 200 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, this time's Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel rewards are double those of previous Glorious Divine Kingdom Duels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne doesn't admit defeat to Leroy...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then ultimately, Osborne will become the champion and receive 20 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara's runner-up position earns 10 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's third place earns 5 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, with Osborne conceding to Leroy, the three have become joint champions, so each of them will receive 20 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Zorro on the stage instantly look extremely grim, his lips twitching, momentarily forgetting to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked up at the Royal Family members' stand, gazing at Callista.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista's face was grim, her fists clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure enough, everyone named Osborne is scum!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista was furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She immediately used Telepathy to transmit to Zorro, "Tell them, no joint champions! They must have a tiebreaker until the champion, runner-up, and third place are decided! Dream on if they think they can trick my Royal Family into rewarding them with more Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista's voice was utterly icy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, a powerful voice echoed in her mind. "Queen Callista, no need for a tiebreaker! Just announce the three of them as joint champions and reward each with 20 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this voice, Callista was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why? It's obvious they're in cahoots, trying to use this method to trick us into rewarding them with more Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. We don't have to..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could finish, Frederick continued, "It's just a bit of Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, so what if we give it to them? Don't forget, the stronger they are, the more it benefits us! Besides, the most important thing now is the Necropolis City plan... don't complicate things further!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's expression was utterly calm at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The result of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel made every Royal Family member feel angry, humiliated, and ashamed. Even Callista was so furious she wanted to kill someone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But only Frederick remained indifferent throughout.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when Osborne defeated Seraphina, not only was he not angry, but he even showed excitement on his face, with a gleam of exhilaration in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't forget, that place can only be entered by those below Empyrean Sacredness! And the stronger they are, the easier it is to obtain the key! Originally, we could only rely on Seraphina... but just counting on her isn't secure enough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And now, with this Osborne..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Our plan will have a greater chance of success! As long as we can get the key, as long as we can uncover the secrets of Necropolis City, nothing else matters!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They want co-champions, then give them co-champions! They want more Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, then give them more Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The treasury of Glorious Divine Kingdom will be fully opened to them, letting them choose freely!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as they can help me get the key from that place, nothing else matters!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After Frederick finished speaking, Callista immediately bit her lip."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I know what to do!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Frederick nodded. 'Also, warn those youngsters, no one is allowed to target or retaliate against them! If anyone ruins my plan, no matter who it is, even if it's your own son, I won't spare them!'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After Frederick spoke coldly, Callista immediately felt a chill in her body. Sensing Frederick's icy killing intent, she felt a bit terrified."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She could only quickly say, 'I, I understand!'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I promise, before they enter Necropolis City, no one will dare to touch them! Your plan will absolutely not be ruined."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Frederick finally nodded and said with a smile, 'Announce the results!'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne... his appearance is simply a blessing! With his strength, he might really be able to get the key for me in that place, and maybe even..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, we might get more than one key!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Frederick's body trembled slightly and uncontrollably. With his strength and cultivation level, such a loss of control could only mean that he was too excited and thrilled at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Almost there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three more days!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three days later will be the once-in-a-millennium day when the 'Spirit-Entombing Fragrance' in Necropolis City becomes thin! By then, we can enter Necropolis City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, I must, like my ancestor Solomon, unlock the Sanctuary Casket in Necropolis City, gain its legacy and power, break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, and venture deeper into the cosmos to pursue the ultimate limits of martial arts..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Almost there, three more days!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick murmured, eagerly hoping these three days would pass quickly so he could enter Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Zorro finally received Callista's instructions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at Osborne and the other two, then said, "Now I announce the final results of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, Clara, Leroy..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The three of you are tied for first place, each receiving a reward of 20 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Rosalie, ranked fourth, is awarded 3 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Seraphina, ranked fifth..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Zorro finished announcing the results and rewards, everyone couldn't help but gasp, looking at Osborne and the other two with a mix of envy and jealousy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and the other two were very happy at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each with 20 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They've struck it rich!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, they can freely choose treasures from the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury!</span></p></div>
