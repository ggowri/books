        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orb of Reincarnation?" Osborne gawked at the gem gently held in Isa's hands, his face a picture of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel some strange energy coming off the orb&mdash;the same kind of energy he'd felt from Clarissa before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That energy was her fate power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was something off about the orb; the energy it gave off seemed way more powerful than what he'd sensed from Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's words hit Osborne like a ton of bricks, and his face turned to one of pure disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Sacred Artifact?! You sure about that?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded with a smile on her face. "No doubt! That's what your past </span><span>self told</span><span> me. In your last life, you had some hidden injuries that wouldn't heal, no matter what. You had to find these special Sacred Elixirs to get better, so you were always taking off into deep space to look for '</span><span>em</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad you just didn't have the luck. You never found those elixirs, so the injuries stuck around. But hey, on the plus side, you did manage to find this Orb of Reincarnation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The value of a Sacred Artifact? It's way above and beyond a Sacred Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isa talked, the Orb of Reincarnation floated smoothly over to Osborne and stopped right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "Thanks to this orb, you got the guts to come up with those bold plans! It's what let you come back from reincarnation so fast, and that's why your cultivation and breakthroughs have been a piece of cake this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the reason you bumped into us so soon after you came back? Yup, it's all because of the Orb of Reincarnation! As for how it actually works, I'm not completely in the know. But this orb has been melded with your soul for ages, so you're the only one who can use its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I do know is that the Orb of Reincarnation can mess with the cycle of rebirth. The rest will become clear once you get those memories back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was floored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It can mess with reincarnation? So, me coming back from the cycle so </span><span style="font-style: italic;">quickly</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, my cultivation going so well, and meeting Clarissa and the others so soon... it's all because of this Orb of Reincarnation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out and his fingers just barely touched the orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right away, he felt this sense of </span><span>deja</span><span>-vu, like the Orb of Reincarnation was a part of him, something that could never be taken away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Orb of Reincarnation is really mine!" Osborne muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he felt there was some kind of memory container inside the orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew right then&mdash;these were the God of Night's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories from his past life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and stole a </span><span>glance</span><span> at the girls. The encouragement in their eyes gave him the push he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No more second-guessing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He plopped down, crossing his legs. "I'm all set to get those memories!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left his mouth, he quickly reached for the memory vessel inside the Orb of Reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bam! In a flash, a flood of information rushed into his head. It felt so darn familiar that he didn't even have to lift a finger. In his mind's eye, like a movie playing, vivid scenes started to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flood of memories began with the wailing of a hungry infant, a sound that echoed the vulnerability of his earliest days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It then carried him through the dark times of his youth, filled with oppression and humiliation that left deep emotional scars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Osborne was thrust into the painful solitude of being exiled from his homeland and landing on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, there was a glimmer of light when he met Clarissa, Anita, and the other orphans. He took them under his wing, teaching them with patience and care, creating a new family in a foreign land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The search for Sacred Elixirs to mend his ailing body was a relentless journey, marked by countless hardships and setbacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as Osborne was starting to build a semblance of a life, Lord Malevolence arrived, throwing the Human Community into peril. Without a moment's hesitation, he made the resolute choice to stand up and protect them, putting his own life on the line.</span></p></div>
