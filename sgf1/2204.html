        <h1>Chapter 2188 Let Her Go</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is this?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence gaped at the bloody hole in his palm in utter disbelief, completely at a loss to explain what had just occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That mysterious purple flash that had struck him was utterly confounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so damn fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So fast that even though he was an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King and a quasi-Empyrean Sacredness warrior, he hadn't had a split-second to react before it hit. His immense power and his tough-as-nails body had been no match for that piercing force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If it were an attack, the one who launched it must have been at least an Empyrean Sacredness warrior, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And not just any Empyrean Sacredness warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he shook his head and quickly dismissed the idea. That purple light was just fast; its power had barely managed to puncture his palm. Such a minor injury was nothing to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If it had been a full-on assault from an Empyrean Sacredness warrior...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that thought, a chill ran down his spine. He knew he'd be a goner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Lord Malevolence let out a disdainful snort, watching as the bloody hole in his palm started to heal. In the blink of an eye, the wound disappeared without a single trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flicked back to Isa, and he let out a sneering laugh. "A minor setback won't change the outcome! You've just delayed the inevitable by a few measly seconds. Now, let's wrap this up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, he balled his fist, ready to unleash a crushing blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shut her eyes briefly. When she opened them again, there was no trace of fear on her face. Instead, her smile grew even brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's really back! I can sense it. He's getting closer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's temper flared at her words. "You silly girl, stop deluding yourself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if the God of Night came back, he wouldn't have the guts to show his face here. If he did, I'd wipe him out without a second thought!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, die..." he growled menacingly, preparing to deliver a devastating strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a voice thundered through the air, filled with urgency and fury. It was like a clap of thunder that shook the very foundations of the world. "Stop!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence, let her go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you so much as lay a finger on her, I swear I'll make you pay with your life! Release her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The furious shouts reverberated, the first echoing from a distance, but by the last word, it felt as though the speaker was right beside them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the battlefield fell silent, and everyone turned to see a dilapidated purple palace materializing not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atop that palace stood a tall, young figure, his crimson eyes locked onto Lord Malevolence with fierce intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his hands, he held a blood-red bow, drawn back to its limit, an arrow shimmering with a threatening energy aimed straight at Lord Malevolence's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purple palace was none other than the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, and the one wielding the bow was Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had finally arrived just in time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the atmosphere shifted palpably. The sudden appearance of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and Osborne's furious voice seemed to hit the pause button on the battlefield, capturing everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Lord Malevolence was forced to halt his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of the Bloodwrought Bow, with an arrow dead-on aimed at him, made his blood run cold and rooted him to the spot. A creeping sense of unease washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His instincts told him that if he continued his onslaught, that arrow would hit its target, and he'd end up injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was beyond belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confusion clouded his features as he sized up Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been expecting the God of Night to finally make an appearance, but instead, he was confronted by a stranger&mdash;a young face that seemed almost out of place in this high-stakes situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?! How dare you threaten me?" Lord Malevolence roared, his voice thick with barely-contained rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Lord Malevolence had stopped his attack on Isa, Osborne let out a sigh of relief. His voice was ice-cold and firm as he declared, "Lord Malevolence, this isn't a threat; it's a warning! Let Isa go, or I'll make sure you pay with your life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for who I am?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My name is Osborne Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left his mouth, a wave of shocked whispers swept through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne? He's the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings from the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wasn't he supposed to be dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has he gone mad? Does he really think he can pass for the God of Night? How dare he threaten Lord Malevolence? Even the God of Night wouldn't be so reckless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disgusting! That pitiful human is just asking for destruction!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The great Lord Malevolence will rip him to shreds, feast on his flesh, and drink his blood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the sneering remarks of the Dark Deity Legion, dripping with contempt and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Osborne! The Osborne from the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community&mdash;oh my god, he's actually alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is he doing? Threatening Lord Malevolence like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't he afraid of death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, Osborne is incredibly talented and powerful among the younger generation. He can even hold his own against the best of the Paramount Supreme Clan, but going up against Lord Malevolence? He's biting off more than he can chew!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These hushed whispers came from the Human Alliance, a blend of admiration and worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! You're finally back!" Anastasia cried out, her voice filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne..." the God of Time whispered, a hint of disbelief in his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, Emma, and Austin thought in unison, tears streaming down their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Darling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't respond to any of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression remained serious as he focused on Lord Malevolence and the grip he had on Isa's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, however, was smiling brightly, her joy undiminished by the perilous situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fixed her gaze on Osborne, her eyes sparkling with happiness, completely unfazed by the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, that's my man! Isn't he handsome?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence froze, momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Isa, his brows furrowing deeper, his expression darkening with irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne?! I've heard of you&mdash;the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings. They say your talent rivals that of the God of Night, perhaps even surpassing him! But you're still so young, and your cultivation level is far too low!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you threaten me? How dare you demand I release her? Hahaha! You're simply asking for death! I'll kill her right now, and let's see what you can do about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Lord Malevolence tightened his fist once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's crimson eyes narrowed, a fierce glint of murderous intent flashing within. "Then go ahead and try!" he shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's utter astonishment, he drew back the Bloodwrought Bow even more forcefully. The arrow glowed with an even more dazzling light, throbbing with menacing energy that sent shivers down spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's body tensed up once again. The air was thick with the palpable threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence, if you have any shred of honor, let her go! I'll take you on! Picking on a woman is no feat to be proud of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's rage reached its peak. "Hahaha! You think you stand a chance against me? You truly have delusions of grandeur. If you're so eager to die in front of her, then by all means!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ricky, step in and help me teach this arrogant fool a lesson he won't forget!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the command, Ricky's eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p></div>
