        <h1>Chapter 2253 Quasi Sacred Artifact Badge-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne confirmed his victory, he intended to leave and return to his quarters to continue his training. However, he was asked to stay for the awards ceremony and the send-off event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no choice but to comply, he remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around him was watching with avid eyes, their looks brimming with admiration, practically worshiping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attention made Osborne feel a bit awkward, but he steeled himself to push down the discomfort and waited for the ceremonies to start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a familiar figure showed up beside him, and the lovely fragrance in the air told him it was Angela, the Peak Lord of Peak Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela said, flashing a warm smile, "Osborne, you were amazing! I'm so proud of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been at the Mystic Sirius Sect for over thirty years, and this is my third time overseeing the Sect Tournament. In the previous two tournaments, not a single </span><span>disciple from Peak Seven managed to make it into the top twenty, let alone get a better ranking. It was really mortifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, you've brought glory to our peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you're the champion, and a well-deserved one at that! Before the tournament, no one had high hopes for you, but you shut everyone up. Great job!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying this, Angela gave Osborne a friendly nudge on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft laugh. "You're overpraising me, Ms. Olsen. I just did my best. And this is just the Sect Tournament. There's still the city duel in Tempest Fortress City and even the state duel in Zephyr State ahead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The opponents I'll face there will be a whole different ballgame. That's where the real challenge lies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's face lit up at his words. "You're so down-to-earth and humble! Winning the Sect Tournament is just the tip of the iceberg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vadim, Jamar, and Bethan are strong within the Mystic Sirius Sect, but they're not big shots in Tempest Fortress City. Don't get too cocky. I hope you can at least make it to the top three in the city duel! Aiming for the championship might be a long shot, but with hard work, anything's possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arched an eyebrow, piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, after I steamrolled my way to the Sect Tournament championship, your bar for me in the city duel is just a top-three finish?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think winning the city duel will be an uphill battle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are there really that many heavy-hitters out there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's expression turned solemn. "Yes, there are some real powerhouses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Sirius Sect hasn't had a disciple in the top three of the city </span><span>duel</span><span> for a century! The top positions have been locked down by Azure Haven Academy and Fantasia Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The previous top three from the last city duel will be back in the fray this time. On top of that, I've heard that both Azure Haven Academy and Fantasia Isle have new prodigies&mdash;dark horses with mind-boggling strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though you made mincemeat of Vadim, Jamar, and Bethan, cracking the top three in the city duel will be no walk in the park. As for snagging the championship..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela left her sentence hanging, but it was obvious she had doubts about Osborne's odds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne lifted an eyebrow, his curiosity sparked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll dig up some info on your opponents and get it to you pronto so you can gear up. I won't pile on the pressure; you've already knocked it out of the park. My baseline expectation for you in the upcoming city duel is to land a top-five spot. After that, just roll with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giving his shoulder a comforting pat, Angela continued, "Now, go soak up the awards ceremony! This is your time to shine! And make sure you prep properly. If you hit a snag in your training, don't hold back from coming to me. I might not be the top-tier warrior, but I can definitely help you sort things out. Just don't let your mind play tricks on you!"</span></p></div>
