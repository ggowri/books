        <h1>Chapter 2297 He's a Goner?-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the seconds ticked by like a time bomb, Angela's expression grew grimmer and grimmer, and her anxiety skyrocketed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela frowned.</span><br><span>What is taking Osborne so long?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on what they knew about Osborne's abilities, he shouldn't have been able to last more than five minutes in the sixth layer, max. Any longer than that, and he'd be pushing his luck big time. He could end up six feet under, lost in the sixth layer forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, six minutes had already gone by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still no sign of Osborne returning to the fifth layer. How could Angela not be worried sick out of her mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could something </span><span style="font-style: italic;">have</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> gone haywire with Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela clenched her fists so tightly. If it weren't for the iron-clad rule that only state </span><span>duel</span><span> participants and referees were allowed inside the Arctic Maw Chasm, she'd have gone charging in there like a bull and hauled Osborne out by the scruff of his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Angela could do was twiddle her thumbs and wait, saying desperate prayers that Osborne was okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the crowd let out a collective gasp that could have knocked the wind out of anyone. Every pair of eyes was glued to the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela whipped her head </span><span>around so fast,</span><span> it was like she'd been hit by a lightning bolt. Her eyes popped wide open in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top dog on the leaderboard had changed. Horace was no longer king of the hill; a new name had taken the number one spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne now held the top spot on the leaderboard with a staggering 300 thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant Osborne had just stumbled upon two more tokens on the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole of Frost Peak City was abuzz with excitement and disbelief. Angela sucked in a sharp breath, too. Just a few minutes ago, she'd been worried sick that Osborne was a goner in the sixth layer, and now, he'd found two more tokens? It was like a plot twist straight out of a wild adventure story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the heck is he up to up there?" someone blurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How on earth can someone be this lucky?" another voice chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each token on the sixth layer was worth a whopping 100 thousand points, but they were rarer than hen's teeth and hidden in spots that were next to impossible to find. Trying to brave the sixth layer's howling storms to hunt down those tokens was a Herculean task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne had managed to find three of them in such a short period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just crazy-lucky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone wrote off Osborne's success as pure dumb luck. They were dead-set on the idea that his lucky streak was bound to end soon, and he'd be hightailing it out of the sixth layer and back to the fifth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they kept their eyes peeled on the fifth-layer Translocator, Osborne never showed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His score on the leaderboard remained rock-solid, not budging an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to crawl by at a snail's pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes ticked by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty minutes passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty minutes went by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour had slipped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Contestants started trickling out of the sixth layer one by one. These were the folks ranked between 20th and 50th on the strength rankings. They just couldn't hack it in the sixth layer any longer and had to hightail it back to the fifth to recharge their Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even then, Osborne was still a no-show on the fifth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela had gone through the whole emotional rollercoaster, starting from the initial excitement and anticipation to the growing anxiety and worry. Now, her face was as white as a sheet, and her fists were balled up tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour had gone by, and Osborne still hadn't made it back from the sixth layer. His score on the leaderboard was still stuck at 300 thousand, not budging an inch for nearly an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth did that mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela caught snippets of the hushed conversations around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Osborne? He's probably six feet under in the sixth layer! There's no way someone with his so-called strength could last up there that long. Even the top fifty contestants have started bailing out, but Osborne's MIA."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, there's only one thing it could be. He's a goner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's face went even paler, and she bit down on her lip so hard it almost bled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, deep in the sixth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm, Osborne exclaimed, a wide grin spreading across his face, "That's the tenth token!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stuffed the newly found token into his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten tokens. If I log them all in, I'll be sitting on a cool million points..."</span></p></div>
