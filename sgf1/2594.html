        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as long as Adriana was by Osborne's side, no matter how angry he was, he dared not do anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he could only lower his head and say dejectedly, "I'll pay! I'm willing to compensate!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne immediately showed a smug smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything became simpler after that. Aaron stopped resisting or struggling and painfully took out his only Supreme Sacred Artifact, erasing his mark from it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, he handed this treasure along with three other Legendary Sacred Artifacts to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "I swear by the Divine Principle, I will never disclose what happened today to anyone. Nor will I seek revenge against Osborne in any way. Otherwise, may my soul be utterly destroyed, never to reincarnate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Aaron finished speaking, Osborne immediately noticed a slight ripple in the surrounding void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And on Aaron, it seemed like something had been added.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the Divine Principle responding?" Osborne murmured, filled with awe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he quickly set aside his doubts, his gaze fixed firmly on the four Sacred Artifacts Aaron offered as compensation, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three Legendary Sacred Artifacts!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Supreme Sacred Artifact looked like a seal, its surface covered with intricate patterns, emitting a soft glow, roughly the size of a fist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other three Legendary Sacred Artifacts were a ring, a heavy hammer, and a pair of gauntlets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get lost!" Adriana coldly said to Aaron, "If you dare trouble my disciple again, I won't need the Divine Principle to act&mdash;I will personally kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron's face was full of frustration. He glared fiercely at Osborne, then glanced at the four Sacred Artifacts in his hand, his heart filled with pain and unwillingness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, he suffered a huge loss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did he fail to take Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge or retrieve the Ice Scepter, but he also lost his only Supreme Sacred Artifact along with three Legendary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He really lost too much!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t dare say another word. After all, he was already considered lucky since Adriana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t kill him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he lowered his head and hurried away, quickly disappearing from sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was only then that Osborne quickly thanked Adriana, "Ms. Alba, thank you for stepping in to save me! Without your help, I fear I would have been in big trouble today!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he handed the four Sacred Artifacts in his hand to Adriana without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was a bit surprised as she looked at Osborne. "These are what Aaron compensated you with, and you're willing to give them all to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a wry smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be honest, he was indeed reluctant to part with these treasures, as they were Supreme Sacred Artifacts and Legendary Sacred Artifacts. Perhaps some of them suited him and could greatly enhance his strength. But he understood that he couldn't be greedy for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He explained, "If it weren't for your help, let alone obtaining these Sacred Artifacts, I might not have even survived. So, I won't hesitate. These things rightfully belong to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana heard this and gave a faint smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took the four Sacred Artifacts, looked them over carefully, and then teased, "You just called me Master, and now you're calling me Ms. Alba?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instantly felt a bit awkward, smiled, but said nothing more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! It seems you're still unwilling to acknowledge me as your master," Adriana continued, "In that case, I won't force you. However, saving you was entirely my own choice, not for these things. So, these Sacred Artifacts should rightfully belong to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop refusing. I absolutely won't take them! I don't need these things. Besides, I think having you owe me a favor is more valuable than these Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He touched his nose and said with a wry smile, "I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. My favor probably isn't worth that much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not now, of course," Adriana said with a faint smile, "but who knows about the future! I have high hopes for your potential. To be honest, back at Mystic Sirius Sect, I did underestimate you. Your potential is no less than Isa's, and it might even be greater. If I had known this earlier, I would have tied you up and taken you to Fairy Moon Sect no matter what!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Adriana's fiery gaze fixed on Osborne, as if trying to see through his soul completely.</span></p></div>
