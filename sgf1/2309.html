        <h1>Chapter 2259 Shocked Angela-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way back to their quarters, Bethan and Jamar exchanged glances filled with confusion and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear they had something to say, but the words seemed to stick in their throats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan finally blurted </span><span>out</span> <span>,</span><span> communicating telepathically,</span><span> "Osborne is incredibly bold! Betting ten thousand Sacred Crystals on himself to win? Does he really believe he can pull it off? What if he loses? That's enough to buy a top-tier quasi-Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar </span><span>nodded,</span><span> his expression serious. "I'll admit, I don't have the guts to take a risk like that. We're not cut from the same cloth as him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan said, "Still, his confidence is a good thing! Even if he doesn't win, his chances of placing in the top five&mdash;or even the top three&mdash;are definitely looking better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar replied, "True. And if he does well, that increases our odds of winning our bets too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, word of Osborne's audacious wager had spread like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson from Fantasia Isle's expression turned icy. He scoffed and said, "What? The head disciple of Mystic Sirius Sect, Osborne, just bet ten thousand Sacred Crystals on himself to win? What gives him the right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who does this guy think he is? Where does he even get that kind of Sacred Crystal? He's way too overconfident! I can't even say for sure that I'll win, and he's just an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King thinking he can take the crown?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting! Now I can't wait to cross paths with him. I'll show him in the arena just how ridiculous his confidence is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tyson closed his eyes, sinking into a meditative state to prepare for the upcoming duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not too far off, Marreese caught wind of the news and stopped in his tracks for a moment. A sneering smirk, dripping with contempt, spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a clueless idiot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does he really think he can take the championship? That's a total joke! Maybe he had a tiny shred of hope in the past, but this year, with Leroy in the picture, he doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell! As long as Leroy doesn't drop the ball, the rest of us, me included, will be scrapping it out for second place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy is a once-in-a-blue-moon talent from Azure Haven Academy! Forget about the city duel; she's a shoo-in for the top ten in the state one, no doubt about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy's ten thousand Sacred Crystals are just going down the drain! But now I'm </span><span>kinda</span><span> intrigued by him. I'm crossing my fingers we'll face off in the arena soon&mdash;I'm dying to see what's giving him all that big-headed confidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Marreese got himself settled and started gearing up for the city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in their lodgings, Osborne had just gotten back when he heard Angela calling out to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, come over here a sec!" He veered off and stepped into Angela's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard you placed another bet? Ten thousand in Sacred Crystals? Betting on yourself to win?" Angela's eyes were fixed on him, </span><span>a look of mixed shock and worry</span><span> on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she first got wind of this, she was floored. To her, ten thousand Sacred Crystals was no chump change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to figure out what was going on in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you're not just acting on a whim?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a little smile. "Ms. Olsen, I'm just having a bit of fun with the bets! That ten thousand was from the Sect Tournament winnings. Even if I lose it, it's no biggie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela wrinkled her nose, clearly not buying it. "Is that really how you see it? Or do you actually think you can take the championship?"</span></p></div>
