        <h1>Chapter 2566 Timeline</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne looked confused, thinking he had seen it wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he carefully looked again, but still found nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eleven hundred years ago, Michelle was framed and executed by the Glorious Divine Emperor without even a chance to defend herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne personally saw Michelle's remains placed into a coffin and then buried in the tomb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Osborne was also implicated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was expelled from the Palace and the Glorious Divine Kingdom. After being hunted, he narrowly escaped alive and hid on Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the next fifty years, Osborne focused on recovering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Michelle lay buried alone in the dark tomb until one day, fifty years later, Callista arrived at the Royal Sepulcher with her guards and stood before Michelle's tomb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She ordered the tomb leveled, the coffin dug out, and the lid smashed open, only to find no trace of Michelle's remains inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne watched the Time Retrace footage three times but still couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t figure out how Michelle</span><span>'</span><span>s remains disappeared. During those fifty years, absolutely no one had visited Michelle</span><span>'</span><span>s tomb, neither to pay respects nor to excavate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, how did Michelle's remains disappear?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t figure it out</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could someone have the ability to retrieve things remotely like my Satan's Eye? But that</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s impossible, because every tomb in the Royal Sepulcher is protected by powerful formations. Without breaking the formations, how could they possibly take something remotely?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne's face turned grim, and he clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's something wrong here." Suddenly, Primordial's voice sounded from Osborne's shoulder. Previously, no matter what Primordial said, Osborne couldn't hear it because he was influenced by his obsession.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne had already calmed down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's voice, Osborne looked over and frowned, "What's wrong here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial quickly said, "Look closely at these two scenes. They seem continuous, but they're actually not. There's about a few minutes of footage missing in between."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Most likely, during these few minutes, someone came near your mother's tomb, opened the formation outside her tomb, and remotely took away her remains."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, this person's power is terrifying, and they used some special methods to prevent you from seeing what happened during that time through Time Retrace."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne's expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked carefully and noticed the problem too. Then, his expression turned grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On the third day after my mother was buried, about five minutes went missing. Did someone take my mother's remains during those five minutes?" Osborne frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In those scenes, about five minutes went missing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne tried many times but couldn't retrieve the missing five minutes, as if some mysterious force had erased them from the timeline.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with time powers, Osborne couldn't retrieve the missing five minutes or figure out who appeared during that time and took Michelle's remains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What was that person's purpose?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "I think you shouldn't worry too much. Such an event might not necessarily be a bad thing; it could even be a good thing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good thing?" Osborne looked at Primordial, puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "Of course. Think about it carefully. Your mother just died three days ago, and an incredibly powerful warrior, capable of erasing timelines, appeared and took your mother's body. What is that warrior's purpose?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is that warrior's purpose?" Osborne couldn't think of an answer to this question.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said helplessly, "You're such an idiot. That warrior is obviously trying to resurrect your mother. A warrior capable of erasing timelines is rare even in the mid-level regions of the cosmos. He surely wouldn't be coveting your mother's freshly dead body, right? Taking her body, of course, is to bring her back to life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly and said, "What did you say? Resurrect my mother?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's impossible. I saw her executed with my own eyes. I also saw her vital essence and soul vanish."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial scoffed and said, "So what? Does that mean she's truly dead? Think about yourself. You have the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. As long as you've copied someone's life essence, even if their body is completely destroyed and their soul utterly obliterated, you can still bring them back to life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is a unique Primordial Creature, with no second one existing, there must be more than one way to resurrect someone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That person taking your mother's remains is likely to resurrect her. At the very least, that possibility exists. Think carefully, don't you feel there's a secret about your mother?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She was just a maid in the Palace. There are at least hundreds of thousands of such maids in the Palace of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, right? Who is the Glorious Divine Emperor? He is the king of the Glorious Divine Kingdom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why would he have a relationship with your mother? Why would he have you with her? If the Glorious Divine Emperor were simply lustful, that wouldn't mean much. But out of all the maids, only your mother caught his eye. Have you thought about these questions?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, your mother was just a maid. So why did Callista target her like that? Did she feel threatened by a mere maid? Otherwise, why would she go out of her way to target your mother so blatantly? In any case, I think there's a big secret about your mother."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her body mysteriously disappeared three days after burial, and even the timeline was erased. This might not necessarily be bad news for you; it could even be good news. Otherwise, Callista would have destroyed your mother's remains long ago. Would you only feel happy if something like that happened?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kept replaying Primordial's words in his mind. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does my mother have a big secret? Was the person who erased the timeline trying to bring her back to life?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt that Primordial's words made a lot of sense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He trembled with excitement and gritted his teeth, saying, "No matter what, I will get to the bottom of this. Whether the person who can erase the timeline wants to revive my mother or harm her, I will find them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial nodded and said, "That's more like it. However, it will be very difficult for you to find that person. Even in the mid-level regions of the cosmos, that person is a supreme warrior, far beyond what you can handle right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I suggest you start investigating the secrets surrounding your mother. Why did the Glorious Divine Emperor favor your mother? Why did he begin ignoring both of you after you were born, allowing other princes and princesses to bully you, and even hastily execute your mother?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why did Callista target your mother? Why did she angrily desecrate your mother's tomb even fifty years after her death? Why..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. I understand." Osborne took a deep breath. "Time is running out. I need to go back now, or people will start suspecting. As for the rest, I already know what to do."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued, his eyes filled with coldness, "I will uncover everything."</span></p></div>
