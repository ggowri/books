        <h1>Chapter 2401 The Terrifying Magma Devourer</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Its power is terrifying," Osborne said, utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The referee accompanying Valentino was the first referee, Prescott </span><span>Torlan</span><span>. Although he was also at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, he was much stronger than ordinary warriors at the same level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in front of the Magma Devourer, he appeared extremely weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Magma Devourer was also at advanced Empyrean Sacredness. But just the immense force from one of its massive forelimbs stomping the ground sent Prescott flying and severely injured him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although this was because Prescott hurried to save someone, leaving no time to defend or use his Sacred Artifact, it was enough to demonstrate the terrifying power of the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it stomped at close range, Prescott would probably be dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Primordial, Osborne said gravely, "Primordial, are you sure we&rsquo;re going to hunt such a Magma Devourer? I don&rsquo;t think we can even get close to it. Even with the Warfare Shield for defense, I can&rsquo;t withstand its attacks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial calmly said, "That's why I didn't ask you to act right away. Don't rush. Our chance comes after the Magma Devourer is injured and its strength is drained."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "Alright, I trust you this time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued watching the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After injuring Prescott, the Magma Devourer didn&rsquo;t even glance at him but continued charging toward Valentino, its eyes burning with intense fury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino lay on the ground, coughing up blood frantically, already gravely injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he was merely an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he was a prodigy, even if he was the most promising contender in the zone duel, his strength was far inferior compared to the advanced Empyrean Sacredness level of the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were simply not on the same level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A single roar from the Magma Devourer was enough to severely injure him. This showed the immense gap between them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, seeing the Magma Devourer charging at him, Valentino was instantly shocked. Ignoring his injuries, he fled frantically for his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Help!" Valentino couldn't care about anything else at this moment, shouting loudly, hoping someone would save him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!" Prescott stood up, seeing the Magma Devourer charging at Valentino again, his face looked terrible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shouted, "All nearby referees, gather around me immediately. It's the Magma Devourer! An advanced Empyrean Sacredness-level Magma Devourer. I can't fight it. It's hunting Valentino, and I can't stop it. Come support me quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying this, Prescott gritted his teeth and charged at the Magma Devourer again. This time, he used a Defensive Sacred Artifact, even mobilizing a Sacred Artifact-level warship and a Sacred Artifact-level saber. He attacked the Magma Devourer frantically, trying to draw its attention and stop it from chasing Valentino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, none of it worked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prescott's attacks were incredibly fierce. But when they landed on the massive Magma Devourer, it was like sinking into the sea, causing no harm to the Magma Devourer at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer is like a massive solid turtle, incredibly tough all over. Even a warrior at advanced Empyrean Sacredness level cannot shatter its body with a full-force attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, Magma Devourer completely ignored Prescott's attack and kept staring at Valentino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you steal my Beast Soul Flower? You deserve to die! You deserve to die! You deserve to die!" Magma Devourer roared furiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason he kept attacking Valentino was that he smelled the scent of the Beast Soul Flower on him. Valentino had previously found five Beast Soul Flowers, and his body was already tainted with their scent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Magma Devourer saw Valentino as a thief and wanted to kill him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It roared again, "How dare you steal my Beast Soul Flower. You deserve to die! You deserve to die! You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer's intelligence is indeed low.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His roars kept repeating this meaning, then conveyed it to Valentino through consciousness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino's face was extremely pale and terrified. "Beast Soul Flower? What's a Beast Soul Flower? I didn't steal your Beast Soul Flower. Please spare me! Please spare me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer became even angrier. It felt that Valentino had such a strong scent of Beast Soul Flower, yet he dared to deny it, which was simply deceiving it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt Valentino deserved to die even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Valentino knew Magma Devourer's thoughts, he would feel extremely wronged because he had no idea that the five Dark </span><span>Mandalas</span><span> he picked were what Magma Devourer referred to as Beast Soul Flowers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he knew, he would definitely return the Beast Soul Flower to Magma Devourer without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even if he returned the Beast Soul Flower, Magma Devourer wouldn't spare him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I want you dead! I want you dead!" Magma Devourer roared, then quickly caught up to Valentino. It raised its enormous forelimb and stomped down hard on Valentino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!" Valentino screamed. But he couldn't dodge at all, so he unleashed all his Sacred Power and activated all the Sacred Artifacts to shield his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he knew it was completely useless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was just an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, not yet at Empyrean Sacredness. Even if he gave it his all, he couldn't withstand Magma Devourer's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Valentino regretted it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He regretted being overconfident and coming out of curiosity to check the situation. Had he known he would face such a terrifying Magma Devourer, he would have fled immediately instead of courting death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino didn&rsquo;t want to die yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was the most promising contender to win the zone duel in Eastern Zone 3. To claim the championship, he had prepared many strategies. But the zone duel was only on its second day, and he hadn&rsquo;t won yet. How could he be willing to die like this?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, faced with the terrifying Magma Devourer's massive forelimbs, he was completely helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Help me! Help me!" Valentino could only shout for help, hoping someone would save him. Unfortunately, it was already too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prescott was already attacking the Magma Devourer like crazy, but he couldn&rsquo;t hurt it at all or stop it from attacking Valentino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only watch as the Magma Devourer slammed its massive forelimb down hard, like an elephant crushing an ant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The defense around Valentino shattered instantly, and even his Sacred Artifact couldn&rsquo;t withstand such a terrifying attack and broke apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Valentino's body shattered as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the Magma Devourer's massive forelimb flattened a volcano into level ground, crushing Valentino into a mess of flesh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino is dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the most promising contender in the zone duel, Valentino was crushed to death by the Magma Devourer before he could even showcase his brilliance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation stunned Prescott, as well as Brenda, Dustin, Mckinley, and others who had just arrived nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They clearly saw the Magma Devourer crush Valentino into pulp with one step, even shattering Valentino's Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, everyone gasped, their eyes filled with terror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the furious eyes of the Magma Devourer suddenly turned to Brenda, Dustin, and the others, as they also carried the scent of the Beast Soul Flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It roared, "How dare you steal my Beast Soul Flower. You shall die! You too shall die! All of you shall die!"</span></p></div>
