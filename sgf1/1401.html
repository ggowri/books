        <h1>Chapter 1400 Strike</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Patrick's command, a dozen Intermediate Deities lunged toward Harry and Amelia, their faces twisted into cruel grins. The siblings didn't even attempt to resist; they knew it would be futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of these Intermediate Deities hailed from the neighboring village, and Harry was all too aware of their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Individually, any one of them posed a significant threat, and together, they were overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no chance of escape, not even a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even if they could run, where would they go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their limited abilities, getting out of this mining area would only lead to a gruesome death at the hands of </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, leaving nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, despair washed over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood all too well what awaited them. Even if they weren't directly responsible for Vance's death, the discovery of the vast number of Essence Crystals in their possession&mdash;including over a hundred mid-grade ones&mdash;would seal their fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick would never let them go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they could do now was hope for a swift end, to suffer as little as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry gritted his teeth, desperation lacing his voice. "Patrick, just kill us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vance was out to get us, and it was </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> who finished him off! We can tell you where the high-grade vein is, just please spare us the torture and let us die quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's laughter echoed in the tense air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry, you're smart enough to know when to beg, but it won't save you! I have plenty of ways to find out where that high-grade vein is without your help. But you two? You killed my wife's brother, Vance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't get off easy! How could I explain that to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Patrick pulled the beautiful woman closer to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up at him, her eyes shimmering with gratitude. "I knew you'd do the right thing, darling! These two scoundrels killed my brother. I want to make them suffer, to make their lives a living hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, my love," Patrick replied, a cold smile creeping onto his face as he turned his gaze back to Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear that? Lock them up and make sure they're thoroughly tortured! I want their screams to echo through this village for three days and nights! Let everyone know what happens to those who dare cross me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, his followers grinned wickedly, eager to drag Harry and Amelia into the depths of the stone hut for their torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The siblings' faces turned ashen, despair filling their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, even death seemed a luxury they couldn't afford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were about to be pulled away, a soft cough broke the heavy silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From behind the stone hut, a figure emerged slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Still</span><span> someone here! You? Good, you didn't run away. You're one of their accomplices too! Grab him and make sure he suffers as well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick sneered, unfazed by Osborne's appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear to anyone that Osborne was gravely injured&mdash;most tellingly, he lacked the Divine Flame above his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant he hadn't ascended to godhood yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not even a Junior Deity to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, Junior Deities were considered the lowest of the low, and if Osborne wasn't even that, he was nothing more than an immature baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would see a baby as a threat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Patrick finished speaking, one of his Intermediate Deity subordinates approached Osborne with a menacing grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even think about struggling. If I squeeze too hard, I might just pop your head like a balloon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia's faces turned white at the sight, their hearts sinking further into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Patrick, this has nothing to do with Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He had no idea we killed Vance or anything about that high-grade vein! He's innocent, you can kill us instead, just let Osborne go," Amelia shouted loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick sneered, saying, "Innocent, you say? I'll believe it when I've interrogated him! Take him in, and make sure to torture him thoroughly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Intermediate Deity chuckled as he reached for Osborne's shoulder, looking completely at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in that instant, Osborne struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held an ordinary-looking scythe, which was none other than the Goddess of Grain's scythe. With a gentle swing, the scythe sliced through the air at a terrifying speed towards the Intermediate Deity's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Intermediate Deity, already underestimating Osborne, didn't even see it coming. By the time he realized what was happening, it was too late to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the sharp edge of the Goddess of Grain's scythe effortlessly severed his entire arm, blood spraying everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne remained clean, protected by a transparent divine power barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp, agonizing scream echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite losing an arm, the Intermediate Deity wasn't immediately killed. He glared at Osborne, his eyes burning with mad rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You filthy bastard, you cut off my arm! I'm going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enraged beyond measure, he threw a powerful punch directly at Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next second, his own head was sent flying into the air.</span></p></div>
