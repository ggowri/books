        <h1>Chapter 1447 Barked</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice wasn't loud, but it cut through the chatter like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had mocked Lachlan fell silent, their expressions frozen in disbelief. Even Walter, seated at the head of the table, along with Lachlan's uncles and older relatives, turned to look at him, their brows furrowed in disapproval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed they found Osborne's words out of line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the members of the Mystic Feather Clan, who had been engaged in their own discussions, shifted their attention to Osborne, surprise etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm, though he was acutely aware that speaking out like this was inappropriate, especially considering he was still masquerading as Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew all too well that Lachlan had, in many ways, been worse than most of the people present when it came to looking down on their fellow Human Community members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him to criticize them now sounded absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "I may be pretending to be Lachlan, but I can't follow in his footsteps and oppress, humiliate, or torment my own people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I don't change my approach, they'll eventually catch on to the fact that 'Lachlan' has had a change of heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than wait for them to figure it out, I'd rather make it clear now that 'Lachlan' has seen the light and will no longer belittle the Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed determination, he continued, "How can you even look down on Ms. Hannah Gellar for her disability? Despite her challenges, she's dedicated to changing the situation for us in the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about you? You all have your health and strength, and each of you has the ability to make a difference for our people, yet you do nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just sit there, feeling superior, waiting for a chance to kick down on those less fortunate, humiliating and exploiting them! To me, you're nothing but scum! You're the true villains of the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze swept over the crowd, sharp and unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rebuke stirred anger among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, have you lost your mind? Who do you think you are talking to us like that? Are you really doing better than we are?" one of them shot back, indignation rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne met their gaze with steely resolve. "You're damn right! I used to be a jerk, too&mdash;a sinner against the Human Community! In fact, I was worse than most of you! But I've come to my senses, and I'm ready to change!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am Lachlan, and I am part of the Human Community&mdash;that's a fact I can't escape! If an outsider is willing to fight for our cause, then why should I, as one of you, sit back and do nothing or even belittle my own people?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From this moment on, I refuse to insult anyone from the Human Community! My power may be limited, but I'll do everything in my power to help others and improve their situations!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I owe the deepest gratitude to Ms. Hannah Gellar! I won't allow you to mock her for her disability because even with her challenges, she's a hundred times stronger than any of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not even worthy of tying her shoes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, Osborne let out a long sigh, feeling an exhilarating sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though these words came through the guise of "Lachlan," they were his heartfelt convictions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had long despised the Swift family's actions over the years and had finally found a voice to express his disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the most powerful force in Wild Flame City, the Swift family had never made any effort to improve the situation of the Human Community in East Zone Nine. Their sole focus was on elevating their own status and strengthening their family's grip on power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To achieve this, they didn't hesitate to turn against their fellow Human Community members, often treating humans with even more brutality than they did other races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Lachlan, for instance. When he ordered the massacre of the miners from Rodriguez Village, he never once considered that those men shared his blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, they were just lowly workers&mdash;expendable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, a single word from Lachlan could have improved the lives of those miners significantly; the overseers wouldn't have dared to exploit them so ruthlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Lachlan chose not to intervene, believing it would offer him no advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This mindset was shared by every member of the Swift family, who felt entitled to their comfortable lives in Wild Flame City without ever contemplating how they could help the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was this blatant disregard that fueled Osborne's anger towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scanned the room with a piercing gaze filled with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was visibly infuriated by his outburst, their faces flushed with indignation but unable to muster a retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a middle-aged man barked, "Lachlan, what's gotten into you? You've clearly lost your mind! Do you have any idea who you're talking to, especially in front of the esteemed Gellar family guests? Get out of here, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to face the man, taking in his square jaw and authoritative demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Calvin, Lachlan's uncle and Belinda's father, the only human chiliarch in the Wild Flame Army. He was also a likely candidate to become the next head of the Swift family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin glared at Osborne, fury radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, are you deaf? I said, get out&mdash;now!"</span></p></div>
