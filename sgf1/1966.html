        <h1>Chapter 1965 Final Fusion</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne returned to Hope Haven, eager to check on the progress of Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After assessing everyone's training, he felt a swell of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all made remarkable strides!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, a shadow of worry crept into his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial, Anastasia's Divine Body has reached Level Ten! When she breaks through, will her Divine Flame merge with her Divine Body and transform into an Infinite Sacred Body? If she gains that, will the Order of the Celestial Way sense her and consider her an anomaly too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial responded without hesitation, "No way! First, even if she possesses a Level Ten Divine Body, merging with the Divine Flame won't directly lead to her transforming into an Infinite Sacred Body. So, there's no chance the Order of the Celestial Way will sense her as an anomaly to eliminate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, not everyone qualifies to be seen as an anomaly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think they consider you </span><span>as </span><span>an anomaly just because of your Infinite Sacred Body? It's also your Soul Current Ocean and immense power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, Anastasia is impressive, but to the Order of the Celestial Way, she's far from being an anomaly! A talent like her is rare among humans, but among those super races, she'd probably be considered... average.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At best, she might rank in the upper middle tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That level of ability won't catch the attention of the top warriors in the Order."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Primordial finished speaking, Osborne let out a breath of relief, but a flicker of annoyance crossed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Average? Anastasia's talent was just average among those super races? At best, she was upper middle tier?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, deep down, he knew Primordial was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The foundation of the Human Community was too weak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being at the top among humans was like being at the bottom tier among those elite races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just look at the Sacred Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were born with the Single Dragon Might, capable of obliterating a small planet. How could the Human Community compete with that? Even after hundreds or thousands of years of training, a human who became an Ascension One or Ascension Two Supernal Deity King might still pale in comparison to a newborn Sacred Dragon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there were the Sacred Tiger Clan and the Angel Clan, which were not much weaker than the Sacred Dragon Clan. Their starting point was already leagues ahead of what 99 percent of the Human Community could hope to achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was utterly unfair!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne firmly believed in defying fate. No matter how poor the foundation of the Human Community was, through relentless training and perseverance, they could catch up to those super races, maybe even surpass them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Order of the Celestial Way wouldn't see him as an anomaly and want him dead if they weren't afraid of him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, contemplating the road ahead, "Anastasia's Divine Body has already reached Level Ten. Without any special opportunities, it'll be tough for her to grow stronger from here on out! Just like me. If it weren't for the fusion with the Primordial, there's no way I could have broken my limits to gain the Infinite Sacred Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now it's time for Anastasia to break through and become a Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Zoe, Kendra, Mila, and the others, they've got plenty of yellow Miracle Elixirs to help boost their Divine Body levels, but pushing their bodies to Level Ten is still going to be incredibly challenging for them. The effects of the yellow Miracle Elixir are diminishing, perhaps even fading away completely. It's likely that reaching the peak of Level Nine will already be their limit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once they all hit that peak, I'll help them break through to become Supernal Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After contemplating his next steps, Osborne turned his attention to the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an abundant supply of Miracle Elixirs at his disposal, he had started administering them to boost their talents and potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he knew that no matter how much he enhanced them, the Blood Demon members would struggle to break through to the level of Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The highest Deity King Level might just be their limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a select few, like Darren and First, had the potential to become Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once they all reach the highest Deity King Level, I'll grant them their freedom. After that, the Blood Demon members won't be of much help to me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could set them free, Osborne needed to complete the ninth layer of fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the strength of his Infinite Sacred Body, he was confident he could handle not just the ninth layer, but even the tenth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once fully fused, he and the Lotus would become one, enhancing his Infinite Sacred Body and restoring even greater energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, before diving into that final fusion, he wanted to check on the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been training relentlessly during this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With ample Miracle Elixirs, Celestial Crystals, and a 200-time acceleration, their strength was skyrocketing. Every day, members were pushing toward the Supernal Deity King level, successfully standing firm on the Ascension Stairway after passing its trials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Supernal Deity King warriors in the Hudson family was rapidly increasing, and everything seemed to be heading in a positive direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling reassured, Osborne returned to Hope Haven, ready to engage in the final fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninth layer of fusion was a breeze for him. He was experienced and, with his current Infinite Sacred Body, completed it effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when he attempted the tenth layer, he encountered an unexpected obstacle, resistance from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity itself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Completing the tenth layer would mean the Lotus would be fully integrated into his Infinite Sacred Body. While it wouldn't cease to exist, it would no longer be separate. It would become a new "organ" within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This idea sparked a sense of reluctance in the Lotus, and it resisted the fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Primordial offered to help, suggesting it could force the final fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne declined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to take that route. A forced fusion might succeed, but the unwillingness of the Lotus could lead to unforeseen complications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Osborne began a dialogue with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This process proved to be incredibly lengthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lacking a complete consciousness, the Lotus couldn't communicate like the Primordial could. So, Osborne wrapped it in</span><span> his soul power, transmitting his thoughts and intentions to ease its apprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't sure if it would work, but he persisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, Osborne sensed that the Lotus' resistance began to wane. This revelation filled him with hope. It meant his approach was effective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued to maintain this connection while also focusing on his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to slip through his fingers like sand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years slipped by in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this day, Osborne finally felt the Lotus' resistance completely dissolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his astonishment, without any prompting from him, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity initiated the final tenth layer of fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Osborne and Primordial were taken aback by this unexpected turn of events.</span></p></div>
