        <h1>Chapter 563 Suppression</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's fist flew with precision, whose force concentrated like a slender needle to pierce through Sam's formidable defenses and embed itself deep within his flesh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Swish!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's scream tore through the air. A gash was opening on his massive frame, and blood spouted forth like a geyser.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He staggered back. His eyes were wide with disbelief as he stared at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Point Blank Force! You've mastered the power of Point Blank Force at the proficiency level!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For the first time, fear etched itself onto Sam's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam suddenly understood that he held no advantage over Osborne. In terms of raw strength, he was only marginally superior. He could morph into an ancient berserk bear, yet Osborne could transform into a vampire with strength far exceeding his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His advanced martial art, Ninefold Tide Crash, could already unleash eightfold tides, but Osborne was even more formidable, capable of producing nine complete waves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam had mastered the Stretch Soft Force, and coupled with his bear-like transformation, defense was his greatest asset. Yet, Osborne wielded the Point Blank Force, able to breach his defenses with ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could Sam possibly defeat Osborne in this battle?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even he, Sam, had failed to master the Point Blank Force, a technique requiring unparalleled control over one's strength. The stronger a person, the harder it was to master.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How did Osborne manage it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's confidence crumbled as his face darkened with uncertainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered, "Still intent on fighting?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam was grim. "Of course! I must fight! I refuse to believe I will fall to you! The Heir's Emblem is mine, and mine alone! You shall die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Sam launched himself anew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had unleashed his full might, no longer holding back. His colossal form resembled a fearsome machine that crushed all obstacles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne seemed but a speck before him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Osborne showed no fear. He erupted with equal vigor, alternating between Point Blank Force and Ninefold Tide Crash, puncturing Sam's defenses and then battering his body with immense force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The clash between the two was a spectacle of violent passion, leaving onlookers in awe. The shockwaves from their power collisions forced spectators to retreat repeatedly, and their faces were solemn with caution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, within the confines of the Augustine Estate atop Challenge Peak, the audience was left speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one could have foreseen that in a direct confrontation with Sam, Osborne would not be swiftly overpowered but rather grow increasingly formidable, seizing the upper hand decisively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hiss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone gasped in surprise to witness what happened before their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, the audience had already been stunned when Osborne, using an energy pistol, had gravely injured Rodney's aides from a distance. But then, their focus had been more on the energy pistol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had assumed Osborne's devastating feats were due to the potent energy pistol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had only dared a sneak attack from afar. Facing Rodney's taunts, he had not dared to respond directly, which seemed to confirm his lack of confidence against Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thus, the audience had felt a tinge of disdain for Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later, they witnessed Sam's successful sneak attack from underground, instantly wounding Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, nearly everyone had thought Osborne was done for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All had felt that Osborne stood no chance against Sam and was destined to be crushed. Or at least, his limbs would be broken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the result was surprising.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, all watched as Osborne used Point Blank Force to repeatedly breach Sam's defenses, causing Sam to bleed profusely. He also employed Ninefold Tide Crash to push Sam back relentlessly, whose complexion was growing paler by the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen, at the forefront, wore an exceedingly grim expression and clenched his fists tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You bastard!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">You've hidden so much strength! Transformed into a vampire? Ninefold Tide Crash? Mastered Point Blank Force? You've concealed so many tricks. It seems you've plotted greatly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, you've been exposed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When you emerge, I won't grant you another chance. I won't let you threaten me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After pondering, Owen returned to normalcy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sam has indeed lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, Osborne still cannot triumph. Even if he manages to defeat Sam, it's meaningless! After all, Osborne's surrounded and has no way out. In the end, he'll still lose his claim to the quasi-successor position!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's right! Osborne can't win!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rodney has sensed the commotion here and is heading this way with reinforcements."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No matter how formidable Osborne is, he can't escape."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's doomed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The battle between Osborne and Sam raged on. Sam was in a dire state, his body drenched in blood. He had given it his all, yet victory remained elusive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes reddened with fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Resentment flared like an inferno. He refused to accept that he was inferior to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Sam Augustine, don't waste your time with him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A voice suddenly rang out, "Mr. Sam Augustine, Rodney is on his way. We can't delay any longer. We must seize the Heir's Emblem immediately!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam calmed down instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spoke coldly, "Osborne, I concede that you are formidable, but the victor today will still be me! The Heir's Emblem is mine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he waved his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone, attack together!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take him down!"</p></div>
