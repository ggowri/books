        <h1>Chapter 1403 Kill Patrick</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm right here; you wouldn't dare to kill me, would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick declared arrogantly, casting a disdainful glance at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the shock of seeing Osborne take down his dozen Intermediate Deity subordinates with such power, deep down, he sensed that he might not be able to defeat Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he felt no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The key difference between him and those fallen Intermediate Deities wasn't just his status as a Superior Deity; it was his official identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a reserve member of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone officially registered with the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, the moment he broke through to the Transcendent Deity rank, he could easily become a full-fledged member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as a reserve, Patrick was already considered part of the Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Zone Nine, an expansive domain spanning millions of miles, the Ninth Dark Deity Legion reigned supreme. They were the ultimate arbiters, the ones who held the power to determine the fate of any life within their vast territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, with the exception of the dim-witted </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, no one dared to oppose the Legion, let alone threaten the life of someone affiliated with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who did would face the wrath of the Legion's millions-strong army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could survive this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this confidence, Patrick stood tall, regarding Osbourne with nothing but contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was certain that Osborne wouldn't dare to lay a hand on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Patrick, astonished and a bit puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unfamiliar with the Ninth Dark Deity Legion and its clout within Zone Nine. To him, the Dark Deity Legion didn't seem particularly impressive; after all, he'd already wiped one out back in his home dimensions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he watched Patrick standing unguarded, Osborn couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's not even trying to defend himself? What's his game? Does he have an ace up his sleeve? Is he trying to provoke me into attacking? I need to tread carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's caution, however, only served to reinforce Patrick's arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mockery on Patrick's face deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode towards Osborne with arrogance, still completely unguarded, and sneered. "Looks like you haven't completely lost your mind! Since you don't have the guts to kill me, it's best you surrender right now. Considering your talent, I might even spare you and recommend you to join the Ninth Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hand over that scythe of yours. And how did you hide your Divine Flame? Tell me your secret, and I'll let you off the hook for killing over a dozen of my men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, you know what the consequences will be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Patrick was just a few feet away from Osborne, his chin held high with pride. Despite the close distance, he remained completely defenseless, convinced that Osborne wouldn't dare to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Patrick with bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He seems to really have no hidden agenda or trump card. Does he genuinely believe I won't kill him?" Osborne thought, feeling utterly perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Patrick's arrogant demeanor, Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick mistook his laughter for surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, I see you've come to your senses. Hand over the scythe," Patrick said, </span><span>extending his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne twirled the Goddess of Grain's scythe in his hand and grinned. "You want my scythe? Alright, here you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he moved the scythe toward Patrick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's eyes gleamed with excitement and mockery because he thought that Osborn was finally bowing to his authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next second, he realized that the scythe wasn't heading for his hand but his throat, moving with sudden, deadly speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Patrick was frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The distance was too close, and Patrick managed only one word before Osborn's scythe sliced through his neck in a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's head flew off, his eyes still wide with confusion and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy actually dared to kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm a reserve member of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion! How could he? Is he ready to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Patrick had no time to continue his thoughts, plunging into eternal darkness as he died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted from his neck as his head hit the ground, and his Divine Body crumpled slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing scream tore through the air as Patrick's wife saw his headless body. With her eyes filled with fear, she shrieked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, a burst of divine power from Osborne silenced her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body exploded into a spray of blood mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne vanished from his spot and reappeared behind the last two Intermediate Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two were still holding Harry and Amelia captive. They were stunned by Osborne's daring act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, they, too, were dead.</span></p></div>
