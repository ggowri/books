        <h1>Chapter 2504 Vice City</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When most people pass through the Cosmic Translocator, they experience a period of dizziness and need some time to recover.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The farther the distance, the stronger the dizziness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne has spatial power, so this dizziness is very mild for him, almost unaffected, and he remains highly alert during each teleportation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every time he finishes teleporting, he immediately activates Satan's Eye to survey the surroundings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no exception this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sudden attack was instantly caught by Osborne, and before Angela and Agatha could react, Osborne had already acted swiftly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Warfare Shield appeared in his hand, unleashing a burst of Warfare Mist, shielding all three of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Warfare Shield's attack struck the Warfare Mist, causing intense ripples, but it was ultimately blocked by the Warfare Mist, leaving Osborne and the other two unharmed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instantly locked onto the person attacking them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a dozen people stood not far away, all mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors. They were quite surprised to see their attack blocked by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they quickly turned around and ran without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne let out a cold snort. Being inexplicably ambushed, he was extremely furious and immediately prepared to chase after them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it, don't chase them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela and Agatha recovered and quickly stopped Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We don't know much about Vice City. These people who ambushed us are obviously local overlords of Vice City. If we chase them and fall into their trap, it will be even more dangerous. Since we're fine, let's not bother with them and focus on the important task at hand."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Vice City is just as chaotic as the rumors say. We were ambushed right after being teleported here. Osborne, luckily you reacted quickly, or we might have been injured if not killed," Angela said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire northern hemisphere of Inferno Planet has only one city, Vice City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's more like a gathering point. Various Space Pirates, Stellar Region fugitives, and even powerful Stellar Exploration Organizations have bases here. The population isn't large, but every individual is ruthless, often resorting to ambushes and killings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's extremely difficult for ordinary people to survive here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But ruthless people see this place as paradise. They thrive on the chaos and disorder, enjoying an environment where they can kill at will.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, not every part of Vice City is this chaotic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are also places where even these ruthless people don't dare to cause trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blossom Cage, where Osborne is heading, is one of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone who caused trouble in Blossom Cage ended up dead. Over time, no one dared to stir up trouble there anymore, making it a safe zone and the liveliest spot in Vice City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's a brothel and a luxurious venue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, most people who come to Vice City are thugs, constantly looting and killing, always on the brink of death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as they have money, they naturally want to enjoy it and spend it quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, if they die and the money remains, that would be tragic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Blossom Cage is a place specifically for them to spend money and enjoy themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, should we go straight to Blossom Cage?" Angela asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face was very red. Blossom Cage is a brothel, and she always thought it was the filthiest place in the world, truly unwilling to go near it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Layne, the deputy leader of the Frenetic Storm Warband, was currently in Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had to go in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought for a moment and said, "I'll go in alone. You guys find a hotel near Blossom Cage and wait for my news."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela nodded but felt a bit worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Once you're inside, don't act impulsively. Blossom Cage is very famous in Vice City, and the forces behind it must be powerful, not something we can handle. First, check out the situation, and when Layne leaves Blossom Cage, we'll make our move."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Don't worry, I know what to do. I won't act impulsively. If there's a chance, I won't hesitate, but if not, I have enough patience."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela and Agatha nodded in relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them headed toward Blossom Cage, but along the way, they could feel many malicious gazes watching them from the shadows, like predators eyeing their prey, which made Osborne very annoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Satan's Eye scanned the area, clearly identifying these malicious individuals. Most were primary and mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors, with a few advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors among them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is our first time in Vice City. If we don't show some strength, they might see us as easy prey," Osborne said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela was also a bit troubled. She had never been to a place like this before and felt as if everyone around wanted to kill them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also felt Osborne made sense. "In Vice City, there are no rules or laws, only ruthless thugs. Here, only strength can protect us, and only by showing power to make others wary can we avoid being treated as prey."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Angela, and Agatha's cultivation level was somewhat too low for Vice City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One was a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior, another a primary Empyrean Sacredness warrior, and Osborne hadn't even reached Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, they would be treated as prey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Normally, they would need at least one advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior leading the team to avoid being easily treated as prey in Vice City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let's show some strength." Osborne snorted coldly, immediately pulling out the Bloodwrought Bow. His Satan's Eye had already locked onto someone hidden in the shadows, eyeing them with ill intent from afar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought that if they wanted to showcase their strength to intimidate the ruthless people of Vice City, they had to choose someone strong enough, but not too strong, to avoid revealing their trump card.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior was just right.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne locked onto the target, decisively drew the Bloodwrought Bow, and formed ten Sacred Power Arrows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He performed the first move of the Solar Sacred Arrow, the Ten-Arrow Volley of Human Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten Sacred Power Arrows shot out, instantly traversing the void and appearing before the man in the distance. His face still bore a vicious expression, and before he could react, the ten Sacred Power Arrows were already right in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, all ten arrows pierced through his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could even scream, his body exploded, and he was completely dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered. "As expected, with my Bloodwrought Bow upgraded to a mid-grade Sacred Artifact and my body advancing to the advanced Sacredness Level, my power has grown stronger. Now, I don&rsquo;t need to use the Earth Arrow; just the Human Arrow is enough to easily kill mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't even need ten arrows; three are enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very satisfied with his current strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After killing that mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior, he coldly glanced at each opponent, instantly startling them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, those people quickly disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, they were all intimidated by Osborne's strength in killing the mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p></div>
