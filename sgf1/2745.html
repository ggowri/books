        <h1>Chapter 2610 Casey</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the woman's hand was suddenly grabbed by Osborne, and she was startled. "It's you, Osborne! The champion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when she saw it was Osborne, her face instantly showed a look of surprise, along with a hint of admiration and excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also recognized her, Casey!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel began, Casey ranked eleventh on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, second only to Mason among the regular participants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She ultimately made it to the top twenty in the competition but lost to the second-ranked Emiliano in the top twenty match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, her performance in that match was outstanding, forcing Emiliano to use over a dozen moves to secure a hard-fought victory, stunning everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne was deeply impressed by her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you..." At this moment, Casey looked puzzled, pointing at Osborne holding her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately felt a bit awkward and quickly let go. "Sorry, I got a little anxious, I didn't mean to take advantage of you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Casey laughed. "I didn't say you took advantage of me, why are you so quick to explain? Besides, you're the champion! What's wrong with the champion taking a little advantage? I won't wash this hand for the next few days&mdash;it was touched by the champion, after all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Casey gave a playful smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt even more awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he could feel that Casey was cheerful and gentle, seemingly full of admiration for him, and probably easy to get along with.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That makes it easier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly said, "Casey, can you give me this ring? It's very important to me! I know you like it too. If you're willing to give it to me, I can give you a Legendary Sacred Artifact ring of similar value."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne looked at Casey seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, he could have simply taken it by force. As long as he placed the Kingdom Duel Badge on it, the protective formation around the ring would disappear, and he could get the ring immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was absolutely certain that Casey couldn't be faster than him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But since Casey was friendly, Osborne didn't want to take it by force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she was the one who noticed it first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Casey looked at Osborne in surprise and excitedly said, "You actually know my name? Have you noticed me before? I thought someone like you, a champion, wouldn't even pay attention to me! Your strength is incredible&mdash;Princess Seraphina was seriously injured by you, and even Prince Matthew and Prince Yunus... They're all stronger than me, yet you defeated them so easily."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You actually know my name!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey seemed unusually excited at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless. He thought, "Aren't you missing the point? We're clearly discussing the ownership of the ring."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just remembered your name, is it necessary to get this excited?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like you really admire me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pondered for a moment before speaking, "Of course I remember you! You're ranked eleventh on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, second only to Mason among regular players. However, I think your strength actually surpasses Mason's. Your performance in the battle against Emiliano was outstanding. Your talent is no less than his, it's just that there's a gap in terms of Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one dislikes being praised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's words immediately made Casey's face turn red. She was both excited and thrilled, with a hint of shyness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blushing, she said, "Re...really? Do you really think so?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey looked at Osborne, her cheeks flushed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She continued, "You... you actually know me so well. Could it be... could it be that you like me? But don't you already have Clara and Leroy by your side? They're both stronger than me and just as beautiful as I am, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ahem!" Osborne quickly interrupted Casey, secretly regretting his earlier compliment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't expected the private Casey to be so passionate, completely different from her calm and decisive demeanor in the ring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly got back to the point, "Let's talk about this ring. I really like it. Can you transfer it to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey quickly snapped back to her senses and said, "Of course! But why are you asking for my opinion? You're the champion! You should boldly tell me you want this ring and then kick me out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey mimicked Osborne's expression as she spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He struggled to keep up with Casey's pace. He had meant well by politely discussing it with Casey, but unexpectedly, Casey thought he shouldn't be so polite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly thanked her and placed the Kingdom Duel Badge on the formation to avoid any further mishaps.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Kingdom Duel Badge was immediately deducted by five billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The formation on the ring disappeared along with it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most Legendary Sacred Artifacts in the Royal Treasury require 1 to 5 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to exchange, but this ring only costs 500 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, making it the cheapest Legendary Sacred Artifact among them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced at Casey's Kingdom Duel Badge and noticed only 500 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints remained on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, Casey had just this amount left, happened to find this ring available for exchange, and decided to grab it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne held the ring tightly, feeling extremely excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had finally found a relic belonging to Michelle. Holding the ring in his hand, Osborne felt as if he could still smell Michelle's scent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But without studying it closely, after confirming it was Michelle's relic, he put the ring away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he found the ring, he still hadn't found the necklace and token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, an hour had already passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In another hour, the redemption time would end, and he had to leave the Royal Treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Casey and said, "Casey, after leaving the Royal Treasury, I'll give you a Legendary Sacred Artifact ring of the same level! But for now, I have some matters to attend to, so I'm leaving!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne prepared to continue searching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey hurriedly stopped Osborne. "Champion, you don&rsquo;t have to do this. You don&rsquo;t need to give me the same thing. I haven&rsquo;t really lost anything. I just wanted to redeem it because it was the only thing I could afford in the Legendary Sacred Artifact section."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you really feel bad about it, then just give me your contact information. I&rsquo;m really curious about how you became so strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Casey looked at Osborne expectantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and gave his contact information to Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "We can exchange ideas sometime!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, stop calling me Champion. The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel is over; it was just a small phase of our lives! Just call me by my name from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey watched Osborne's departing figure, her eyes sparkling and cheeks flushed, like a girl deeply in love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She murmured, "He's so strong, so handsome, and most importantly, so kind. I really envy Clara and Leroy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, I need to stay in touch with him more."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, Osborne had no idea what Casey was thinking. He had already left the area storing the Legendary Sacred Artifact and entered the area housing the Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were only two people here, Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because only they had enough Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to exchange for a Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The exchange price for a Supreme Sacred Artifact ranged from five billion to fifty billion Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This area housed tens of thousands of Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye, quickly scanning the area, and his eyes lit up again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He found it!</span></p></div>
