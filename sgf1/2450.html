        <h1>Chapter 2359 Gift of the Battle Blade-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately communicated with the Warfare Ancient Tree and quickly confirmed that Primordial wasn't lying to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree can indeed help Osborne nurture the Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more and stronger Sacred Power Osborne provides, the faster the Warfare Ancient Tree grows, and the more power it has to help him nurture the Sacred Artifact, enhancing its abilities and level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the Warfare Ancient Tree can fully nurture new Sacred Artifacts according to Osborne's requirements, making the Sacred Artifacts it creates more compatible with him and capable of unleashing greater power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even, Osborne only needs to provide the Warfare Ancient Tree with an idea, and it can nurture the corresponding Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's like giving the Warfare Ancient Tree a blueprint and parameters for a Sacred Artifact, and the Warfare Ancient Tree can create that Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, that Sacred Artifact will be fully compatible with Osborne, unleashing the greatest power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's truly a great thing," Osborne sighed. At this moment, he no longer blamed Primordial for secretly making a bet with the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even thought Primordial did the right thing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's view, the value of the Warfare Ancient Tree far surpasses that of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. Unfortunately, Osborne has not yet reached Empyrean Sacredness. Although he has fused three types of power, making his Sacred Power much stronger than others at the same cultivation level, there is still a significant gap between him and a warrior truly at Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Sacred Power he provides to the Warfare Ancient Tree isn't strong enough, the tree's growth will be too slow, and the nurturing and enhancement of the Sacred Artifact will also lag behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When I advance my cultivation level in the future, everything will get better." Osborne knew he couldn't rush.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "You can feed the Empyrean Sacredness-level skeleton you obtained on Umbra Earth to the Warfare Ancient Tree. It contains immense power and is excellent </span><span>material for crafting a Sacred Artifact. But since you don't know how to craft Sacred Artifacts and don't have the time to learn, you might as well feed it directly to the Warfare Ancient Tree. This will accelerate its growth and make the Sacred Artifact it nurtures even stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne instantly became excited. "Really?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smiled and said, "Of course. If you kill a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness in the future, you can also feed their corpse to the Warfare Ancient Tree. The Warfare Ancient Tree thrives on the corpses of the strong. The more powerful corpses you feed it, the faster it grows. It can even absorb the power attributes of the strong and imbue the Sacred Artifact with corresponding powers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became even more excited, thinking, "Now I know how to enhance the Warfare Ancient Tree. This is great. I can't defeat warriors at Empyrean Sacredness right now, but it will be different in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I want revenge. In the future, I will inevitably face many warriors at Empyrean Sacredness, even the top ones. By then, I will feed all their corpses to the Warfare Ancient Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne continued studying the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took the Warfare Shield from the Warfare Ancient Tree and held it in his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, he infused Sacred Power into it. Instantly, a layer of Warfare Mist enveloped him. He felt that he wasn't fully compatible with the Warfare Shield and couldn't unleash its full power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Warfare Shield is the best among mid-grade Sacred Artifacts, almost reaching top-grade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne's current strength, he couldn't fully activate or unleash the power of the Warfare Shield. This was perfectly normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the defensive power of the Warfare Mist he unleashed was equally formidable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Few below Empyrean Sacredness could break through this Warfare Mist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne had to give his all to do so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Great. With the Warfare Shield, I've finally made up for my weakness in defense. From now on, I don't have to worry about someone breaking through my defense and directly injuring my body." Osborne was very satisfied with the Warfare Shield.</span></p></div>
