        <h1>Chapter 2283 Accommodation-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's voice came through the communicator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm already in Frost Peak City! When are you gonna get here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a faint smile. "I'll arrive tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara nodded and continued, "Frost Peak City's a madhouse right now! I've never seen so many powerful warriors of the same level all in one place. A bunch of people have asked me to join their teams, saying they'd give me tens of thousands of Sacred Crystals if I lent them a hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Did you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not! I already promised to team up with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft laugh. "But I won't give you any Sacred Crystals, not even a single one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want your Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Then why do you want to team up with me? What's in it for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara said calmly, "A chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, I don't know those other people well. I don't wanna team up with them! Anyway, during the state duel, I'll do my best to help you get a better ranking. If we rack up enough points... then help me get a good ranking too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne talked with Clara for a bit before ending the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a day went by. The Mystic Sirius Sect's warship took off once again, with cheers from numerous sect disciples ringing in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Danilo of Peak One and Angela of Peak Seven were still in charge of the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were making their way to Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frost Peak City was quite a distance from Tempest Fortress City. So, their warship only reached Tempest Fortress City. From there, they had to use the Translocator in Tempest Fortress City to get to Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, the group of five arrived in Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frost Peak City was blanketed in snow throughout the year. It was a gorgeous winter paradise, and the city was extremely bustling. Since it was the location for the state duel, everyone who wanted to watch had flocked here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spotted all kinds of peculiar creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tempest Fortress City was predominantly inhabited by the Human Community, so the majority of its residents were humans. However, the entire Zephyr State boasted a hundred cities and was home to hundreds of different races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the more powerful ones were the Human Community, the Ember Phoenix Clan, the Stellary Wolf Clan, and the Ebony Sheep Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's head to the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's where the Zephyr State officials have arranged accommodations for the state duel participants!" Angela announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they found themselves in front of a massive complex. A glistening plaque hung above the main building, bearing the words: [Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, a continuous stream of warriors was going in and out of the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex, each exuding an intimidating aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne, Bethan, and Jamar completed the registration process, they each got a badge and a key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendant at the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex informed, "Osborne, you're ranked 108th on the state duel strength list. Your accommodation is in Zone One, Courtyard 8.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bethan, you're ranked 825th. Your place to stay is in Zone Eight, Courtyard 25.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jamar, you're ranked 950th. You'll be staying in Zone Nine, Courtyard 50.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback by what the attendant said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">We are going to be staying in different places?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It seems that our accommodations are directly tied to our positions on the strength list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Apparently, the higher one's ranking, the better the accommodation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't resist asking, "Where do the top 100 ranked participants stay?"</span></p></div>
