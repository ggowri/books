        <h1>Chapter 2211 Retreat-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Racial Convergence Planet?!" Isa exchanged worried glances with her companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After vanquishing Lord Malevolence, they had become the undisputed rulers of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life there was comfortable and secure, a far cry from the uncertainties of Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never set foot on Racial Convergence Planet, but they were well aware of its reputation. It was the largest, most prosperous life planet in the entire star system, a veritable sanctuary for cultivators.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Racial Convergence Planet, powerhouses were everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a place like Racial Convergence Planet, it was almost laughable to think that one could drop just a single brick and take out a bunch of Supernal Deity Kings, not to mention potentially flattening an Empyrean Sacredness warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer number of strong beings there was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they ruled </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet with an iron fist, their status would be far less impressive on Racial Convergence Planet. In the more remote areas, they might still carve out a kingdom, perhaps even establish a faction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like Lord Malevolence had done before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence had once founded the Malevolence Empire on Racial Convergence Planet, but his empire had been among the weakest and was swiftly crushed by the surrounding powers, forcing him to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That had all happened in the far reaches of the planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the central areas of Racial Convergence Planet, any major faction could effortlessly annihilate </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet. Take the Mystic Sirius Sect as an illustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders and leaders there were all Empyrean Sacredness-level warriors, but even they were just an ordinary faction in the big picture, outshone by numerous other groups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa and the others were reluctant about Osborne's plan to head to Racial Convergence Planet so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when they saw the resolve on his face, they decided not to air their worries. He had made his decision, and all they could do was stand by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days later, the Empire of the Sun was officially founded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took the throne as king, and the news spread like wildfire. Everyone whole-heartedly accepted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was the one who had defeated Lord Malevolence single-handedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumors that Osborne was the reincarnation of the God of Night had also swept across </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, squashing any opposition. Even those who might have been against him kept quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the grand coronation ceremony, Osborne summoned the elite members of the Human Community and the various races that had been under Lord Malevolence's rule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stood in front of them, they all shouted in unison, "Your Majesty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him stood Isa, Clarissa, Emma, Anita, Austin, Anastasia, Zoe, Jethro, and Sebastian&mdash;his trusted allies and family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no intention of handling the day-to-day operations of the Empire of the Sun. That was what his loyal companions were for. They were the ones who would ensure the empire ran like a well-oiled machine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the coronation ceremony concluded, Osborne felt a wave of exhaustion wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just physical fatigue; it was a deep, soul-wearying exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he planned to step back from leadership for a while and enter a period of seclusion. He needed to consolidate the immense power he had gained recently and integrate the techniques from his past life into his current abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he retreated, Osborne issued two important directives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, he ordered a comprehensive search for his parents&mdash;Theodore and Vivienne. No matter what it took, even if it meant turning </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet upside down, they had to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second, he mandated a thorough investigation into the factions under Lord Malevolence that had previously slaughtered and enslaved members of the Human Community. There would be no mercy; those responsible would be punished, and if necessary, executed.</span></p></div>
