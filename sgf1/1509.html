        <h1>Chapter 1508 Neighbor</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the woman enveloped in black mist prepared to leave, Osborne sighed and called out, "Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to the staff at the Urban Development Exchange, asking, "Is she the owner of the manor I'm trying to buy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff looked at each other, equally perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a hand emerged from the mist, holding a colorful token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing it, the staff at the exchange perked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, it's her! That Rainbow Crystal Token is the key to the manor's defensive array and also its proof of ownership. Since she has it, she is indeed the owner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt even more exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the woman in the mist, frowning. "Who are you exactly? Owning such a manor means you must have quite an identity. Why did you tease me at the slave market, making me lose 30 million Essence Crystals just to buy you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, the woman let out a light chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you finally want to know my name? But, I'm not telling you! And about the 30 million you lost at the slave market, I've already paid you back double, haven't I? Did you really think this manor was being sold because I'm short of money? Or that it's only worth 50 million?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you were aware I wanted to buy a manor and deliberately put it on sale for me? No wonder it was so cheap... But what's your game here? Its value is likely well over 200 million; you're selling it to me for a mere 50 million. What exactly do you want from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for the lack of any hostile intent from this woman, he would have certainly believed her to be plotting against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman murmured, "What exactly do I want from you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, I don't know either. I just feel you're different from the other humans in the East Zone. I wanted to get to know you and see how far you can go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then calmly added, "In any case, I'm selling this manor to you for 50 million&mdash;take it or leave it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his eyebrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I'll take it! Why wouldn't I? Even if you have some scheme, selling a manor like this cheaply, I'd be a fool not to take it! Once the deal is done, the manor is mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne pulled out a Dimensional Bag. Inside, he had already managed to stash two million mid-grade Essence Crystals, worth over 200 million low-grade Essence Crystals, which were more than enough to buy the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's complete the transaction. Don't regret it," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman looked at Osborne and smiled. "Alright, I never regret my decisions. Looks like we'll be neighbors from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The duo then signed a contract at the exchange, exchanging the sufficient Essence Crystals, and the manor officially belonged to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his hand, he now held a colorful token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pocketed the token and waved his hand, saying, "Let's head back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he was ready to leave with Betty and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman, taken aback, exclaimed, "You're leaving already? You're really cold-hearted. After all, I sold you the manor at a bargain. Can't we chat a bit more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "If you want to chat, come visit the manor. Out of respect for you being its former owner, you're always welcome. But if you're looking for trouble, that's another story."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne continued to walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman hesitated but decided to follow. Unfazed, Osborne kept moving, realizing the enigma of this woman. He even tried using his Satan's Eye to observe her, only to find that even his Level Nine Satan's Eye couldn't penetrate the layer of black mist surrounding her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Osborne couldn't gauge her power level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he wanted to avoid any trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of foreboding told him that getting involved with this woman would bring significant trouble. So, when the woman followed him, Osborne not only didn't stop but also sped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miraculously, the woman matched his pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they neared his newly acquired manor, Osborne finally halted and turned to face her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly are you up to? I said, don't stick to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel nothing good will come from associating with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was stern. He was clearly expressing his dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman burst into laughter, retorting, "Why do you assume I'm sticking to you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this road yours? Besides, what's wrong with associating with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I that frightening? Oh, and I'm not following you! My home is right here! Guess what? We're neighbors now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, the woman strolled toward a manor not far away.</span></p></div>
