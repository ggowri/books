        <h1>Chapter 2632 Surpass-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The trial on the fourteenth floor was even harder for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Out of a hundred warriors' projections, only fifty reached mid Empyrean Sacredness. No wonder Seraphina and the others took about a hundred breaths to finish the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this was still effortless for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No warriors' projections could withstand his attacks; they were all instantly killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Clara, Leroy, and Casey didn&rsquo;t need to make a move at all. Osborne swiftly ended the battle and claimed the highest reward again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was one hundred million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With this, earning battle points isn't that hard. We've already got 230 million battle points just by clearing the fourteenth level. Once we clear the eighteenth level, the battle points we earn will definitely be enough to exchange for the Perfect Dragon Elixir!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rewards he gained after successfully clearing the Celestial Spire were immense, far better than what he got from participating in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel lasted an entire year. Starting from the Sect Tournament, Osborne went through the city duel, state duel, zone duel, and finally the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. He faced many difficulties and challenges, but in the end, he only earned over 50 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over 50 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints is equivalent to more than 500 million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, they have gained over 200 million battle points in just one day after entering the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, they spent most of the first day breaking through their cultivation level, which took a lot of time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their actual time spent clearing stages was less than a day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, they will surely earn more battle points and exchange for many treasures that cannot be obtained with Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne feels that earning battle points here is too easy for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, only he can say such things because his strength is strong enough. If it were someone else, not only would they fail to get the highest rewards on every stage, but just reaching the fourteenth level without being eliminated would already be impressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, after Seraphina teamed up with so many people, they have only managed to get one-tenth of the highest reward so far. Perhaps soon, they will only be able to get the lowest reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They might even gradually get eliminated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina is already the trump card prepared by Frederick. To help Seraphina improve her strength, Frederick tried every possible method.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, Seraphina still feels it&rsquo;s very difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Osborne still feels completely at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's keep going!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne began to feel excited. "Maybe I really have a chance to earn enough battle points to buy the Imperial Artifact! As long as I'm strong enough, the Celestial Spire is the greatest opportunity in Necropolis City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and the other three entered the fifteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina and her teammates were wandering through the mist on the fifteenth floor, searching for the trial location. She had lost her sense of direction and could only rely on luck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, as long as they were willing to spend time, they would eventually find it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne didn&rsquo;t plan to follow them anymore. He was already familiar with the Celestial Spire, so he no longer needed to stick with Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Osborne felt they were too slow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne planned to get ahead of Seraphina and the others. Although the effect of Satan's Eye would be suppressed in the mist of the Celestial Spire, he was confident he could find the trial area faster than Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly led Clara, Leroy, and Casey around Seraphina's team. He scanned the surroundings with Satan's Eye and searched at an incredible speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes later, Osborne found the trial area on the fifteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up! Don't let them know we've gotten ahead of them," Osborne said.</span></p></div>
