        <h1>Chapter 2280 Strength Boost-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The release of the state duel power rankings had a sobering effect on the disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, on whom they had pinned their hopes, hadn't even cracked the top hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan and Jamar fared even worse, ranked near the bottom, after eight hundred&mdash;virtually the weakest of all the state duel contestants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you guys still going to the state duel to watch?" someone asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! I was all set to go and cheer Osborne on, but now I'm having second thoughts. There are so many powerhouses in this state duel. Osborne doesn't seem to have a shot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the point of going when we already know it's a lost cause? Traveling </span><span>to the place </span><span>and getting tickets aren't cheap. Why spend money just to watch Osborne and the others get thrashed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't feel like going either..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, I'm definitely going to watch. Even if I know Osborne and the others probably won't win, it's a wilderness battle. You never know what might happen. Maybe they'll catch a lucky break."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's even tougher precisely because it's a wilderness battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luck? Even with a stroke of good luck, can they take on a strong team? Some teams have several members ranked in the top hundred, even ten or twenty. If Osborne runs into them, he might as well throw in the towel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not going. I'll just stay in the sect and wait for the news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going! Not for any other reason, but to see if those at the top of the power rankings are really as powerful as they're said to be. It'll give me some goals to aim for..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, watch out. You don't want your confidence to take a beating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chatter wasn't limited to the disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect. Folks from every major faction were weighing in on the rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over at Azure Haven Academy, Leroy did a double-take when she saw her name at the ninety-sixth spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the sole representative from Tempest Fortress City to make it into the top hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, I'm ranked higher than Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's probably fuming. He won the Tempest Fortress City championship but couldn't crack the top hundred, and here I am, someone he beat, outranking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, this ranking makes perfect sense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Leroy spoke, a long spear burst into her grasp, surrounded by roaring flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I owe you big time. If you hadn't knocked me out when you did, I'd probably have been devoured by the Inferno Drake Lance. There's no way I'd have been able to fully master it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though I'm in your debt, I'm gonna take you down in the state duel! I'll show you that I've outgrown you," Leroy declared, her eyes ablaze with a ferocious fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over at Fantasia Isle, Clara was checking out the power rankings too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw her name at the 299th spot, she puckered her lips in a pout, her face scrunched up in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered, "Almost dropped out of the top three hundred? Seriously?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare they look down on me! They've got Leroy at 96th, and I'm on the verge of falling out of the top three hundred. Is there really that much of a gap between us? Even if she's fully mastered the Inferno Drake Lance, I'm not backing down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! And they've got Osborne ranked below Leroy, outside the top hundred. They're really dissing Osborne big time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. I'm done with this ridiculous ranking list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once the state duel wraps up, they'll realize how laughable this ranking is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara huffed, then took off to resume her solitary training.</span></p></div>
