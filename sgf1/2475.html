        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waved his hand lightly and collected the seemingly useless pile of bones, including the strange tooth. He was very satisfied with this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though he spent 1,200 Sacred Crystals to buy a fake Empyrean Sacredness bone, he believed the deal was absolutely worth it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That strange tooth was undoubtedly a treasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had full confidence in his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "I'll study it carefully when I get back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued strolling down Star Street but didn&rsquo;t buy anything else. Overall, the items on Star Street were a mix of real and fake, and quite a few things seemed good and genuinely useful to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, either he felt the price was too high and not worth it, or he simply couldn&rsquo;t afford it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, Osborne thought that with his Satan's Eye, it would be easy to find treasures on Star Street. But he realized he had underestimated the vendors here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who could sell things on Star Street were extremely shrewd, and it was rare for them to fail to recognize valuable items.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After wandering around, Osborne only ended up gaining a lot of knowledge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy ultimately didn&rsquo;t buy anything either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said, "The auction is about to start! Let's hurry over! There will be real treasures at the auction, we can't miss it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three left Star Street and headed to the auction house in </span><span>Zephyrville</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne saw the auction venue, he couldn't help but be a little surprised. "Is this the auction house under Phantom Commerce Guild?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy nodded. "Yeah! What's up? Phantom Commerce Guild is one of the top three powers on Racial Convergence Planet, controlling immense wealth and holding the most treasures. Their auctions often feature rare artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not long ago, they even auctioned a Sacred Sanctum in the chaotic Realm! It's said to be a top-grade Sacred Sanctum that sold for an astronomical price!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy continued, "Now, I can finally establish myself on Racial Convergence Planet. After the Zone </span><span>Duel</span><span> ends, I should start figuring out how to find my parents. They were sold by slave traders controlled by Phantom Commerce Guild to the Frenetic Storm Warband."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After the Zone </span><span>Duel</span><span> ends, I'll find a way to investigate the Frenetic Storm Warband. I must locate this organization as soon as possible and rescue my parents!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne walked into the auction with Leroy and Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three were not considered VIPs, so they could only participate in the auction from the main hall. They didn&rsquo;t mind, as they were merely there to gain experience and had no intention of actually buying anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the auction officially began.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first auction item was a Sacred Artifact. Although it was just a regular low-grade Sacred Artifact, it sparked intense competition and bidding, eventually selling for two million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel amazed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He now had less than two hundred thousand Sacred Crystals left, not even enough to buy a tenth of a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, the Sacred Artifact was just to warm up the event.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The items auctioned next were much cheaper, ranging from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands of Sacred Crystals, and the bidding for these items was even more intense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, for most people, millions of Sacred Crystals aren't easy to come by; only the major powers are qualified to compete for Sacred Artifact-level treasures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chatted quietly with Leroy and Clara while silently observing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He originally thought he wouldn't make a move at the auction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, an auction item caught his attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The sixty-fifth auction item, a seed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The auctioneer displayed the item for everyone to see. It was a fist-sized seed, its Plant Clan origin unknown. It looked quite peculiar, covered in sharp, razor-like spikes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, an incredibly pure vitality emanated from the seed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The auctioneer continued, "This is a special seed. Our Phantom Commerce Guild invited numerous experts to identify it, but none could determine what kind of seed it is. We also </span><span>tried various methods to cultivate and sprout it, but all attempts ultimately failed, so we had to give up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the auctioneer finished speaking, a buzz of chatter erupted from the audience.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What kind of seed is this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It can't even be cultivated to sprout?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's the use? It's just a seed that can't sprout, completely worthless!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A seed that can't even sprout, and they're auctioning it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The auctioneer smiled broadly and raised his hand to signal everyone to quiet down. "Although we at Phantom Commerce Guild cannot make this seed sprout, that doesn't mean none of you can. The reason we are putting it up for auction is that this seed contains immense vitality. It is absolutely alive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if you still can't cultivate it to sprout after purchasing, you can consume it directly. The immense vitality it contains can heal injuries and even extend lifespan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Starting bid, ten thousand Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the auctioneer's words fell, the crowd started murmuring again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can heal injuries and extend lifespan? Hmm, it does have some use. If the price is reasonable, I might consider buying it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I bid eleven thousand Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twelve thousand Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fifteen thousand Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bidding voices continued to rise, but the atmosphere wasn't lively. After all, there are many ways to heal injuries and extend lifespan. Many Sacred Elixirs offer the same effects and are much cheaper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those participating in the bidding are probably just curious and want to buy it to try cultivating. If it ultimately fails, using it as medicine won't result in a loss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had already pushed Satan's Eye to its limit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He carefully observed the seed, and a look of surprise gradually appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This seed has a problem! Its surface is indeed filled with rich vitality, but inside it hides a completely different power, the scent of death! Such pure scent of death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Osborne was pondering, </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> voice suddenly echoed in his mind. "Osborne, buy this seed! It will help you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked doubtfully, "Primordial, do you recognize this seed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and replied, "That's right! If I'm not mistaken, this is a Death Vine seed. Death Vine is a type of Primordial Creature. Although it's not as powerful as the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity or the Warfare Ancient Tree, once fully cultivated, it's still incredibly formidable. It can transform into a weapon, and its specialty is entanglement. Once someone is ensnared by it, there's no escaping."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, the Death Vine can be woven into Death Vine Armor, which possesses extremely strong defense. The reason these people can't make it sprout is that they don't know the method. Death Vine seeds need to absorb a large amount of the scent of death to germinate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you possess Death's Stare, which can completely cultivate and make it sprout. Once it sprouts, you can establish a connection with it and merge through Death's Stare. This way, your Death's Stare will become significantly more powerful, and you can also control the Death Vine to fight for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In short, this Death Vine seed is a rare treasure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The people at Phantom Commerce Guild actually failed to recognize its value, setting a starting bid of just ten thousand Sacred Crystals for auction&mdash;it's ridiculous. This item wouldn't be expensive even at ten million or even a hundred million Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Primordial finished speaking, Osborne's eyes immediately lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "A Death Vine seed? This is indeed a treasure!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, he raised his paddle without hesitation and shouted, "Twenty thousand Sacred Crystals!"</span></p></div>
