        <h1>Chapter 2150 The Disappointed God of Light</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "The Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community have become far too arrogant lately! I admit their talent is impressive, and they've brought us many victories in the border competition, boosting the morale of the Human Alliance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what does it matter? Their cultivation levels are far too low. In this all-out war between the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Human Community, they can't change a thing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're so young yet think they can lecture us? As if we lack backbone and they're the only ones with guts. It's utterly ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's next? Are they going to start giving us orders? If they get a little stronger, will they treat us like their subordinates?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A number of people chuckled derisively, their disdain palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, God of Light snapped, her voice sharp and commanding, "Enough! Before the war has even begun, you're spreading rumors and mocking those who are willing to fight for the Human Community. Which side are you really on? Have you already surrendered to the Paramount Supreme Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep within her eyes, disappointment flickered like a dying ember.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but question whether her thousand years of dedication to protecting the Human Community had been worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here she was, prepared to defend them, while the very people she fought for were contemplating surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the God of Light felt an overwhelming sense of despair. She thought, "Maybe I should just find a place to hide and sit this war out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, I'm an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Dark Deity Legion wipes out the Human Community on Celestara Planet and enslaves them, I could leave this planet. With my strength, I'd thrive anywhere else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My life could still be fulfilling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as that thought crossed her mind, she pushed it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't leave! I can't just give up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I walk away, the Human Community on Celestara Planet will truly lose all hope. The morale of the Human Alliance will shatter in an instant. I've guarded them for a millennium. I can't be a coward in this final battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed determination, the God of Light's eyes sparkled with resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Everyone, let's not be so pessimistic! God of Night hasn't abandoned the Human Community. On the contrary, his disappearance is for our sake! He's working on a plan that, if successful, could utterly defeat Lord Malevolence and finally resolve the millennia-long conflict between the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, God of Night is fighting for us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe he will return! Our task is to buy him more time. As long as we don't give up, we will wait for God of Night to come back and end this war once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her words hung in the air, a spark ignited in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed God of Light, are you serious? God of Night hasn't given up on us? He's executing a plan to completely defeat Lord Malevolence and resolve this war?" someone asked, excitement bubbling in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light nodded, though she hesitated to share this information. She feared that someone among them might be a traitor, leaking her words to the Paramount Supreme Clan, potentially jeopardizing God of Night's plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she knew she had to speak up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't, the morale and fighting spirit of the Human Community would crumble before the war even began. With so many already contemplating surrender, she needed to instill some confidence or risk a swift defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light bit her lip and continued, "I have no reason to deceive you! Even if God of Night doesn't return in time, that doesn't mean we won't find new heroes among us who can stand against Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps someone will rise to battle Lord Malevolence..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light finished speaking, and a figure flashed through her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a tall, striking woman&mdash;Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe she could stand against Lord Malevolence! But lately, she's shut herself away in the Sanctum of Night and hasn't shown her face. I have no idea what she's up to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, I believe that when the war breaks out, she will emerge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she's God of Night's woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking her head to dispel her thoughts, God of Light continued, "In any case, I sense that an all-out war is imminent! If you don't want your loved ones to become the vassals of the Paramount Supreme Clan, to be enslaved under Lord Malevolence's command, then prepare for battle! Victory for the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd echoed, "Victory for the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As God of Light concluded this impromptu meeting, her expression turned grave as she gazed at the looming Ninefold Heaven's Tower. Above it, dark clouds of war seemed to gather, swirling ominously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Are they finally unable to hold back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's been nearly a month! I suppose we've achieved our initial goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... where are you, God of Night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why haven't you returned?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thousand years ago, you could have chosen to do nothing, living a leisurely life in seclusion while we served you. Yet when Lord Malevolence invaded, you stood up for the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, a millennium later, our situation is even more dire, and I wonder&mdash;can you really turn the tide?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can you truly resolve this war?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Night, where are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mix of longing and worry clouded God of Light's flawless features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, her expression hardened as she turned her gaze outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the Sanctum of Light, a surge of divine power erupted, and the massive projection of Icy One appeared in mid-air, his cold gaze fixed on her, a sneer on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, come out, and let's have a chat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a disdainful huff, God of Light wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She projected her own towering figure, standing defiantly before Icy One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He studied her perfect face, a flicker of greed and desire flashing in his eyes, but he quickly suppressed those thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, this border competition has been going on for almost a month now! I must admit, I'm a bit surprised by the strength of your Human Community. You've managed to hold your own against us from the Paramount Supreme Clan. Quite impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light scoffed, her voice dripping with contempt. "Hold our own? Icy One, you really have no shame! If it weren't for your sneak attack, killing Osborne and taking down the other two of the Seven Young Deity Kings, how could you possibly claim to be on equal footing with the Human Community in this competition?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and your Paramount Supreme Clan would be crushed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's expression darkened at her words. "Hmph! What nonsense about the Seven Young Deity Kings! What nonsense about Osborne! He's dead, so stop bringing him up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A dead genius is no better than a useless fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, his disdain evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light retorted, "Icy One, you're truly shameless! I have no time for your games. What do you want to discuss? Just get to the point!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her directness, Icy One chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do I want to discuss? You've probably already guessed. But since you're eager to hear it, I'll lay it out for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've decided to cancel the border competition!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The war has begun!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm giving your Human Community one last chance to surrender. If you agree to yield, I promise not to kill you. Otherwise, those who resist will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was cold and final, leaving no room for doubt.</span></p></div>
