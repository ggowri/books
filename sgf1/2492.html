        <h1>Chapter 2394 Not Effective on You-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Osborne had ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame, he still felt a sense of discomfort at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "My Dark Phoenix Flame isn't strong enough after all! But, it's sufficient! Since I've reached the central area, I should start searching properly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye was pushed to its limit as he began searching volcano by volcano in the central area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne found another Beast Soul Flower, and then discovered even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was delighted. In the terrifying environment of the central area, the number of Beast Soul Flowers was far greater than in the outer regions. With the help of Satan's Eye, he could find a Beast Soul Flower almost every ten minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was no longer thinking about the zone </span><span>duel</span><span> championship but about how many Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> he could ultimately exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This journey might bring him nearly a billion Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't believe anyone could gain more than him. Although it was only the first day of the zone duel, he was already certain he would be the champion!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, on the edge of the volcanic area, two figures appeared, one following the other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were a man and a woman, seemingly in a race. The woman arrived first, with the man trailing five minutes behind. It seemed they weren't far apart, but the woman looked </span><span>relaxed, clearly not giving her all, while the man&rsquo;s face was flushed, and his forehead was covered in sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, he had been pushing himself hard earlier, but in the end, he still couldn't catch up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he looked at the woman with displeasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! Brenda, you were just a little faster than me! But this time, the zone </span><span>duel</span><span> champion will definitely be me, Valentino!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man was Valentino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the woman was another top contender for the championship, Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda glanced at Valentino casually and said, "Valentino, you want the championship? Too bad, with me here, you don't stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino said coldly, "Brenda, you're too arrogant! I admit that if it really comes down to a fight, I might not be able to take you down, but it's also hard for you to beat me! More importantly, this time in the zone duel, it's not just about strength to win the championship; it's about treasure-hunting skills."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not long ago, my father bought me a Void Ray's Starry Eye at an auction. After fusing with the Starry Eye, my vision has greatly improved, and I can vaguely sense the aura of treasures and lock onto them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this kind of treasure hunt, you can't beat me. This championship is mine for sure!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Valentino's face was full of arrogance. His right eye suddenly glowed with a purple light, with countless starlike points flickering within, as if it could perceive the essence of the universe&mdash;it was the Starry Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino looked at Brenda disdainfully. "I have the Starry Eye, what do you have to compete with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda glanced at Valentino's right eye, smiled faintly, and said, "Oh? The Void Ray's Starry Eye is indeed impressive, but how do you know I don't have an even stronger trick?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished speaking, without waiting for Valentino to respond, her right eye also burst into light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this light was golden, even more dazzling than Valentino's Starry Eye's flickering purple glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino's expression changed instantly. "This is... Golden Dragon Eye?! You actually fused with the Golden Dragon's magic eye?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda smiled faintly and said, "If you can fuse with the Starry Eye, why can't I fuse with the Golden Dragon Eye? I just don't flaunt it like you do, so you didn't know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino's face darkened, and he clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! </span><span>So</span><span> what if you have the Golden Dragon Eye? The Golden Dragon Eye might not be stronger than the Starry Eye! Let's see whose power is greater, your Golden Dragon Eye or my Starry Eye!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Valentino charged out first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I will find more Dark Mandalas, gain more Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, and the championship will definitely be mine!"</span></p></div>
