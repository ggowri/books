        <h1>Chapter 1928 The World Tree</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, the Miracle Elixirs I've brought are more than enough. You can use them freely! No matter how much you consume, you must break through to Level Nine in your Divine Body before you reach Supernal Deity King! Anastasia, you must hit Level Ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words hung in the air as his companions nodded vigorously in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Osborne! With everything you've set up for us, if we can't pull it off, then we're just useless! Just take care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They responded before they all departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they left, Osborne made his way to a quiet corner of Hope Haven with the scaled-down space in tow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see what this little sapling is all about!" he murmured, his excitement bubbling over as he flashed into the scaled space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he materialized before the towering sapling, which stood over a thousand yards tall, he noticed the dazzling seven-colored barrier surrounding it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This shield was incredibly robust; even two Supernal Deity Kings attacking together couldn't breach its defenses, and neither could the full power of Osborne's Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to Osborne, that barrier was irrelevant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to his spatial power, he didn't need to break through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he could simply use interdimensional travel to slip right inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, the barrier didn't impede his ability to travel dimensions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With ease, Osborne passed through the vibrant shield and entered the magical space within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he did, every pore in Osborne's body seemed to open wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the air was thick with an incredibly potent and pure energy. This energy was so powerful that even Osborne's Divine Body, which had reached the pinnacle of Level Ten, couldn't help but greedily absorb it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his astonishment, he realized that his Divine Body was strengthening with every moment he soaked in the energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he had thought reaching Level Ten was the apex of his growth within Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd always believed the limits of his Divine Body and elemental essences would be firmly capped at Level Ten, and he'd seen no improvement after using yellow Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, feeling a surge of growth within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "This energy must be emanating from the sapling! It's miraculous that something so potent can enhance my already peak Level Ten Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of life form&mdash;or treasure&mdash;could produce such extraordinary power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with newfound determination as he stepped closer to the little sapling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In its presence, Osborne felt incredibly small.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trunk of the sapling was so massive that it would take several of him to wrap around it fully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, it's enormous!" Osborne marveled, but then he recalled the ten-thousand-mile-long decayed roots, reminding him that in the grand scheme, this was still just a "little sapling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What in the world is this?" Osborne pondered, gazing intently at the towering sapling before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a lengthy observation, he felt an irresistible urge to touch it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as his hand was about to make contact, he suddenly froze, his expression shifting drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, Osborne sensed the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity within him tremble slightly, as if trying to send him a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, his hand suspended in midair, a look of grave seriousness crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne focused intently on the fluctuations of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, interpreting its warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it indicating that this little sapling is extremely dangerous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he murmured to himself, he couldn't help but marvel, "It's just a sapling, yet it can provoke such a reaction from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! Now I'm really starting to think this sapling is on a whole other level, even surpassing the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Resolute, Osborne decided to press forward and placed his hand firmly against the trunk of the sapling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity merely warned him, but did not urge him to leave immediately or instill a sense of fear or panic. This suggested that while the sapling might pose some danger, it was not a severe threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Osborne made contact, his body shuddered as if an electric current shot from his palm through to his entire being, filling him with an exquisite sense of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, within the next heartbeat, a cascade of information surged into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"World Tree?" Osborne gasped, the name rolling off his tongue as he connected the dots through the mysterious flood of knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he understood the true nature of the sapling standing before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It's called the... World Tree!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This World Tree, like the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, predates the formation of this starry cosmos! It existed in the chaos long before the universe exploded into existence. The World Tree was the very first life form to arise from that primordial chaos. Its immense body and boundless power supported the chaos itself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even treasures as remarkable as the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity thrived under the protection of the World Tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, one fateful day, a devastating bolt of lightning struck from beyond the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That terrifying bolt shattered the World Tree and tore apart the chaos itself... and in that destruction, the chaos exploded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the cosmos emerged!"</span></p></div>
