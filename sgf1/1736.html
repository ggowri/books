        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Feather Clan watched in stunned silence as Alfred, after consuming a single pill, instantly returned to his peak state. His divine power, once drained, now surged back with overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all left dumbfounded, their eyes clouded with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Feather Clan of Wild Flame City had 11 Deity King warriors in total. The strongest, Maxime, had already been severely injured by Aldrich and was out of the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, the seven Deity King warriors had engaged in a war of attrition, finally managing to deplete Alfred's divine power. They thought they were on the verge of victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfred was back to full strength in the blink of an eye?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't fathom what kind of pill he had taken or why its effects were so terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred, on the other hand, was back at the top of his game, while they had only three Deity King warriors left. How were they supposed to beat him now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could the Mystic Feather Clan's Deity King warriors in Wild Flame City really be defeated by Alfred, one by one?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation crept into their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred sneered, saying, "I told you before, it's laughable to use a war of attrition against me. It's utterly useless! You have no idea what resources I, a super genius of the Paramount Supreme Clan, possess. These Miracle Healing Pills that can instantly restore my divine power to its peak</span><span>, </span><span>I have ten of them! Enough to take all of you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smug smile spread across Alfred's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words only deepened the Mystic Feather Clan's despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way they could win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred had the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Supreme Malevolence Shield, and now he had the Miracle Healing Pill to instantly restore his divine power. Without a mid-stage Deity King warrior, how could they possibly defeat him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charge all at once?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, they could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were currently surrounded by warriors from the Bowman family, the Demonic Dragon Clan, and the Soaring Lion Clan. If they dared to rush him, they would face an even more cruel massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Feather Clan was now utterly despondent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred spoke calmly, "Let's keep going! Don't waste any more time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have three Deity Kings left. Come at me one by one. It's an honor to be defeated by my Supreme Malevolence Sword, for I am destined to be the greatest Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfred pointed his Supreme Malevolence Sword at the last three Deity King warriors of the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three exchanged glances, their expressions grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, one of them stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle resumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the Mystic Feather Clan's Deity King didn't waste time with a war of attrition. Knowing that it was useless, he burst into his most powerful attacks from the start, unleashing his ultimate skills in the hope of breaking Alfred's defenses and inflicting a severe injury, if not outright defeating Alfred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, with the strong Supreme Malevolence Shield and Alfred's own formidable strength, the Mystic Feather Clan's Deity King failed to penetrate his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was defeated, barely managing to avoid being cleaved in two by Alfred's sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the second one stepped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the second-to-last Deity King warrior of the Mystic Feather Clan was also defeated by Alfred, everyone's eyes turned to the final old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew he was their last hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he was Hannah's grandfather, Raoul!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul was the second most powerful warrior in the Mystic Feather Clan of Wild Flame City, just a notch below Maxime and very close to the mid-stage Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was their last hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If even Raoul couldn't defeat Alfred and ended up losing, the Mystic Feather Clan would be finished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Raoul felt an immense pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he said nothing, simply stepping forward to face Alfred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred sneered, "Old fool, you must be Hannah's grandfather, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah killed my cousin Tobey, practically asking for death! Too bad she's already gone</span><span>. </span><span>I couldn't finish her myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But killing you will be just as satisfying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfred lunged into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying black sword light flashed, so dark it seemed to radiate an eerie brilliance. Raoul didn't dare to underestimate it, immediately putting all his strength into his defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred had already defeated multiple Deity King warriors from the Mystic Feather Clan with this move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Raoul was stronger than those defeated, he wasn't much stronger, and he still hadn't reached the mid-stage Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a powerful clash, Raoul took a step back, a sword cut appearing on his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression grew even more solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, that's all you've got! Time to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he had injured Raoul with a single strike, Alfred relaxed and increased the speed of his attacks. Even when Raoul unleashed his full power, he struggled to hold back Alfred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to counterattack but couldn't pierce Alfred's Ultimate Malevolence Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew the Mystic Feather Clan was finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul had no chance of defeating Alfred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfred wasn't about to let Raoul off easy. His attacks became even more ruthless, leaving deep wounds on Raoul's body, as if determined to torture Raoul to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul was soon drenched in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Hannah watched, her face pale. She immediately wanted to rush in and save him.</span></p></div>
