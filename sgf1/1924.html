        <h1>Chapter 1923 Wounding the Supernal Deity King</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time in battle, Osborne unleashed the Divine Ascendance Technique: Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, countless Shadow Drakes erupted from his body, roaring as they surged forward under his command, racing toward Jasper with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jasper was already engulfed in the agony of his soul being ignited. Flames engulfed his head, and while this soul fire wouldn't harm his Divine Body, it inflicted horrific damage on his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His soul power was nowhere near as resilient as Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the flames consumed him, Jasper felt his soul power rapidly diminishing. If this continued, it would be burned away entirely. His Divine Body might remain intact, but he would be dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Supernal Deity King with centuries of battle experience, Jasper quickly realized he was facing a ruthless soul attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was a fire elemental Supernal Deity King, he couldn't control the soul fire. Desperately, he tried various methods to extinguish the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he realized none would work, he understood that his only chance of survival lay in severing his own soul&mdash;cutting off the ignited part and sacrificing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a heavy price to pay, but at least it would keep him alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Jasper prepared to take that drastic step, Osborne's Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes unleashed its fury!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless Shadow Drakes surged toward him, and Jasper's heart sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's speed in executing the Divine Ascendance Technique was astonishing. Unlike others, his elemental essence had already fused with his body, allowing him to unleash his abilities much faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, when an Ascension One Supernal Deity King attempted a Divine Ascendance Technique, they needed at least three seconds to prepare, especially for more powerful techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne could unleash his almost instantaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper didn't have time to react; he hadn't even dealt with the Soul Spark Oblivion before he was faced with the onslaught of the Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he felt the overwhelming force of the Shadow Drakes, his face paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What pure, terrifying dark power! I have to block this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the scent of death closing in, Jasper abandoned his concerns about the burning soul. He unleashed his divine power, blue flames erupting around him to form a fiery defense, hoping to shield himself from Osborne's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next heartbeat, the Shadow Drakes collided with Jasper's fiery barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his defenses crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's eyes widened in horror. He had tried to overestimate the Shadow Drakes' strength, but he quickly realized he had miscalculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their power exceeded his expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's dark energy was on par with that of Lord Malevolence, and the Shadow Drakes not only possessed immense strength but also a corrosive effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's defenses were utterly inadequate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, countless Shadow Drakes overwhelmed him, drowning him in darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The true power of the Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes was now on full display. As the Shadow Drakes crashed into Jasper, even he&mdash;the Ascension One Supernal Deity King&mdash;found himself unable to withstand the onslaught. His Divine Body began to crumble and disintegrate under their relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams of agony echoed across Primordial Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper shouted, "Ah!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Terry, who had been busy digging up the roots from the ancient tree some distance away, finally sensed something was amiss. When he turned to see Jasper being pummeled by countless Shadow Drakes, his heart dropped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thick earth wall erupted in front of Jasper, providing a brief reprieve from the overwhelming assault. Though the wall shattered almost instantly under the force of the Shadow Drakes, it was just enough time for Jasper to escape. He shot forward and reached Terry's side in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed at this turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "The power of Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes has exceeded my expectations! Even an Ascension One Deity King struggles to withstand it! But there are still weaknesses to exploit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The speed of the Shadow Drakes is somewhat lacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For a Deity King-level warrior, they're fast enough that dodging is almost impossible. Not even the strongest Deity Kings can escape their grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet, a Supernal Deity King can evade them with relative ease. Thankfully, I managed to ignite his soul power first with Soul Spark Oblivion. Otherwise, getting my Shadow Drakes to land a hit would have been no walk in the park!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But as I continue to elevate my own power, the speed of my Shadow Drakes will only increase. Sooner or later, even Supernal Deity Kings won't be able to dodge them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, when speed is insufficient, numbers can more than compensate! When hundreds of Shadow Drakes attack in unison, no one can sidestep their onslaught!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's icy gaze settled on Jasper and Terry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was in dire straits, his Divine Body on the verge of collapse. He looked utterly defeated, his spirit wilted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The part of his soul that had been ignited was now severed and abandoned, leaving him gravely injured and stripped of his combat abilities.</span></p></div>
