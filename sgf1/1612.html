        <h1>Chapter 1611 You're Also From the Human Community</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown, thinking, "Another member of the Soaring Lion Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's no surprise they're an Upper Race with so many warriors. Although Riley isn't from the Huntington family, the camaraderie between him and Emmett is clear&mdash;they're definitely in cahoots."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that everyone's here, let's get moving," Riley announced, scanning the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were a mere twenty in number, tasked with protecting only Emmett and Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though small, the team was elite: one mid-stage Deity Overlord, two early-stage Deity Overlords, and sixteen peak Celestial Deities. Only Osborne was at the lowest rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Emmett at peak Celestial Deity and Diana at the late stage, their combined strength would hold up well even against a small army of </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, they wouldn't face any issues in the Level Five mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, it's good to see you again. I'm leading your escort once more. It's not our first time working together, so let's hope this mission goes as smoothly as the last and we all return safe and sound with plenty of rewards," Riley said with a casual smile, looking directly at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed her expression stiffen. She seemed reluctant, but after a moment, she nodded silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found her reaction odd, sensing something off about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley, however, paid no mind to Diana's discomfort. His gaze suddenly landed on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? A newcomer? Early-stage Celestial Deity?" he said, raising an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Emmett leaned in and whispered something in Riley's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of realization crossed Riley's face, and when he looked back at Osborne, his expression turned mocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome!" Riley said, his tone dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then addressed the crowd, "Since everyone's here, let's head out! Our target is the 53rd mining area, and we expect to be gone for five to seven days. Let's move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Riley led the way through the eastern gate, confidently striding toward Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed that as soon as Riley stepped outside, a divine power barrier enveloped him, forming a tight shield around his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His demeanor shifted, becoming more serious as his eyes darted around. Clearly, he was on high alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett and the others mirrored this vigilance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "We have only just left the base&mdash;does Riley, a mid-stage Deity Overlord, really need to be this cautious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Falling to the back of the group, Osborne pondered for a moment before deciding to follow their lead. He summoned his own divine power to cloak himself, preparing for any potential threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Riley and the others were far more familiar with the area and had undertaken missions before; their caution surely had its reasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was confident, but he wasn't foolish enough to gamble with his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Osborne? From Wild Flame City?" Diana asked, falling in step beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley and the other members shot her a glance but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed that they had formed a protective circle around Emmett, clearly prioritizing his safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana seemed to be left to her own devices, as if they were only concerned about protecting Emmett and not her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Osborne raise an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Diana, he nodded calmly. "I am. How can I help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "Nothing important. I just noticed you're also from the Human Community. It's rare to see one of our warriors in such an elite escort team, so I thought I'd take the chance to get to know you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she quickened her pace, leaving Osborne behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, feeling a bit confused by her sudden departure. But just then, he heard her voice in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, have you offended someone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked ahead at Diana, who was scanning her surroundings with a wary expression. Everyone around her was completely unaware that she was secretly communicating with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, he replied mentally, "Why do you think that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because if you hadn't, someone like you shouldn't be in this elite escort team. This group was put together by Riley and Emmett specifically for their protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, being from the Human Community, don't fit in. Normally, you wouldn't even be able to join such a squad! I can see it in Emmett's eyes&mdash;he means you harm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know what you did to anger him, but you'd better watch your back. If anything feels off, just run and don't look back! Stay alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Diana in disbelief, thinking, "Is she actually trying to help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you warning me?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana fell silent for a moment, and just when he thought she wouldn't respond, her voice echoed in his mind again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you're also from the Human Community."</span></p></div>
