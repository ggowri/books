        <h1>Chapter 460 Control Shadows</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The muzzle of the energy pistol was pointed at Alexander's head, and Osborne was about to pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a loud shout suddenly rang out, followed by several young figures appearing and standing in front of Alexander and Wade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Evelynn, Charlie, and the other three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who had spoken was Charlie. He looked at Alexander, who was falling on the ground, with a look of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, why don't you get up quickly? You are bringing shame to our 25th Power Prodigy Class!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Charlie's words, Alexander felt a little humiliated. But he didn't dare to show it. Instead, his face was full of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said excitedly, "Charlie, save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie said coldly, "Shut up! If I didn't want to save you, why would I show up? Why don't you stand up quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his words, Alexander was so happy that he wanted to stand up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I didn't ask you to get up. How dare you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly stiffened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie's expression turned cold. He looked at Osborne and said calmly, "You are Osborne, right? I'm Charlie Powell. For my sake, let him go. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had actually discovered these five people a long time ago. He had been wary at first because they were very young, but two of them were Class A metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been fighting, but he had also been on guard against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since they had no intention of taking action, Osborne gradually ignored them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, just when he was about to kill Alexander, they stood up and wanted to save Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Osborne agree with it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Alexander colluded with the Aberrants, secretly targeted the Augustine family, and forced Clarissa to marry him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "Charlie? I haven't heard of you. Why should I obey your words?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Charlie suddenly turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you are so arrogant! No matter what, Alexander is my classmate in the Power Prodigy Class. I can't let you kill him. You'd better let him go. If you don't, don't blame me for punishing you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop thinking that you're amazing just because you can beat Alexander. Alexander is only ranked last in our 25th Power Prodigy Class!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie's eyes were filled with threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his eyebrows. "Power Prodigy Class? I've never heard of it. Anyway, I don't care what your relationship is, get out of the way immediately. Or, I will kill you, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie was so angry that he laughed. He said coldly, "If that's the case, do it. I want to see how you'll kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne shot at him without any hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of the energy bullet was breakneck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the energy bullet was already in front of Charlie. But Charlie did not panic and did not even move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a ball of rotating energy quickly appeared in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy bullet hit the rotating energy ball, but it did not penetrate it directly as Osborne had expected. Instead, it stopped as if it was stuck in a quagmire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several energy bullets in succession had the same situation, which immediately surprised Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the rotating energy in surprise and then looked at the girl behind Charlie, who looked to be about twenty-three or twenty-four years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This girl was the other Class A metahuman among the five people besides Charlie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked stern and calm, with pride on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie smiled, "Thank you, Evelynn. Actually, you don't have to do it. I was trying to see if I could block his energy bullets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't make so much trouble. Let's get what we want and leave as soon as possible," said Evelynn coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie nodded quickly. "Okay! But he is really a bit arrogant. If I don't teach him a lesson, he won't obey us! Let me defeat him first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Charlie took action directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand. Osborne suddenly felt that his body could not move. Then, his hand seemed to be controlled by a powerful force. He actually raised the energy pistol and pointed it at his own head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers were also moving, pulling the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was suddenly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, be careful! He can control shadows! He controls your shadow, and the movements of your shadow will affect your own movements!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's worried voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne looked at Charlie in surprise, thinking, "Is his power to control shadows?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a weird power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie laughed wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Clarissa and said calmly, "You are very knowledgeable. You can tell at a glance that my power is to control shadows!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what if you find out? Can you solve it? Now, I have controlled his shadow. Through his shadow, I can make him shoot himself in the head!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Charlie controlled Osborne's shadow. Osborne's shadow's hand held the pistol, pointed it at his head, and pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Osborne's finger also pulled the trigger!</span></p></div>
