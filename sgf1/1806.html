        <h1>Chapter 1805 You'll Have to Kill Me First!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery unleashed his full power, showcasing the true might of a peak Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others simply couldn't hold their ground against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, their recent training sessions in Hope Haven had forged a strong bond among them, allowing for a level of coordination that somewhat compensated for their differences in rank and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without that teamwork, they would have been overwhelmed in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, as they struggled to withstand Hubery's onslaught, they managed to hold out a little longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration flickered across Hubery's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're risking your injuries to hold me back, but I suspect you have other motives. Are you trying to buy time?" His voice dripped with disdain, and the atmosphere shifted as the realization hit the young warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery continued, a cold smirk appearing on his face, "You've got some skills; I'll give you that. Even I would need some time to wipe you all out. But now that I see through your little game, it's simple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just won't bother with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned his attention toward Osborne and Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You five are stalling for those three over there, aren't you? Ha! I don't know why you're doing this, but it doesn't matter&mdash;you're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Hubery launched a devastating punch toward Osborne, the force of which threatened to obliterate everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face paled in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was currently entangled with the dark energy of Lord Malevolence and couldn't afford to split his focus. If he did, the dark energy would spiral out of control, creating an even bigger mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what choice did he have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should he deal with Hubery first?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would leave Bryce vulnerable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me handle this!" Hannah declared, biting her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Osborne's response, she dashed forward, positioning herself between him and Hubery's impending attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next heartbeat, Hannah poured every ounce of her strength into blocking Hubery's strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood erupted from her mouth as her body slammed hard against the arena floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had done it&mdash;she had managed to absorb the brunt of his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Hubery scoffed, his eyes narrowing as he spotted Osborne working to heal Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight fueled his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, Hubery unleashed an even more terrifying assault, aiming to crush Osborne and disrupt his healing of Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah lay on the ground, blood pooling beneath her, unable to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Anastasia sprang into action, racing toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She threw herself in front of him, ready to absorb the next blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent everyone flying again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were battered and bloodied, struggling to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only thirty seconds had passed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, however, remained relatively unscathed thanks to her Supreme Sovereign's Armor, which provided formidable defense, even against Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting her teeth, she stepped up to stand protectively in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to hurt Osborne, you'll have to kill me first!" Zoe declared coldly, her resolve unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery chuckled. "You think that because you wear Supreme Sovereign's Armor, I can't touch you? Sure, it can withstand the attacks of a peak Deity King, but it's not invincible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your level of power, how much of its strength can you truly unleash?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was one of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all finished! This is just a futile struggle! I'll deal with you first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Hubery charged forward once more, ready to unleash devastation upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery unleashed a powerful punch, sending Zoe flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the Supreme Sovereign's Armor protecting her, her face paled, and a thin thread of blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she immediately positioned herself in front of Osborne, her jaw set in stubborn determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's relentless attacks continued, each one more devastating than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's complexion grew increasingly pale, and the blood from her mouth steadily increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was swaying on her feet, but she refused to back down, standing firm in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The armor, though formidable, wasn't invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A peak Deity King, while unable to easily breach the armor, could still channel a portion of their power to penetrate its defenses and injure Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each strike, Zoe's body took more damage, teetering on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she knew she was their last hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to hurt Osborne? You'll have to kill me first," she muttered, stepping once more between Osborne and Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's anger boiled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to get killed? I didn't plan on using my ultimate move, but since you're asking for it, I'll give you what you want! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous rumble filled the air as Hubery unleashed an even more terrifying attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the immense force shattered the defenses of the Supreme Sovereign's Armor.</span></p></div>
