        <h1>Chapter 2261 Advancement-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group matches continued to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the second day, Osborne was scheduled to fight early, facing Earl from a Third-rate Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to form, he didn't waste any time&mdash;he drew his bow, loosed an arrow, and swiftly defeated his opponent before heading back to the competitors' lounge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, fellow Mystic Sirius Sect disciples Jamar and Bethan, both seed players, had a smooth ride in their own group. They easily dispatched their opponents, securing their spots in the next round without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the same couldn't be said for the other Mystic Sirius Sect participants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many found themselves up against equally matched opponents, and some unfortunate souls were even placed in groups with other seed players, leading to quick eliminations and a bleak path to advancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the third day of group matches began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's next opponent was Quincy from Azure Haven Academy, a man with cold, piercing eyes. Quincy had bested Lavoy from Fantasia Isle the previous day and was riding high with two victories under his belt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their upcoming duel would determine who would advance from their group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quincy glared at </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> his expression icy. "Look, I know I might not stand a chance against you, but don't think you can take me down easily! I heard you bet ten thousand Sacred Crystals on yourself to win the whole thing? Hilarious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, his voice dripping with disdain, "You'll never beat Leroy! She's the pride of Azure Haven Academy, and she'll wipe the floor with you, showing you just how big the gap really is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't even need Leroy to take you down; Marreese and Pero could handle you with ease! You think you can make it to the top five? Dream on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Sirius Sect is washed up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Quincy crossed his arms, a smug look plastered on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained </span><span>unfazed,</span><span> his calm demeanor unbroken. "Is that all you've got? If you're done talking, why don't you head to the sidelines? You seem to enjoy critiquing others&mdash;maybe you should stick to that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne drew back the string of his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power arrow coalesced, radiating a terrifying force that locked onto Quincy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quincy's determination hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't take me down that easily!" he shouted, swinging his massive battle blade in front of him like a makeshift shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade was enormous, resembling a door more than a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since defensive divine artifacts were prohibited in the city duel, Quincy had cleverly chosen this massive blade, hoping to exploit the rules and use it for defense at a critical moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed this would give him a fighting chance against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for Quincy, he underestimated Osborne's capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Quincy brandished his "shield," Osborne smirked, the arrow on his bow glowing brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow shot forth, disappearing in an instant, only to reappear right in front of Quincy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was lightning fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was why no one had managed to evade Osborne's arrows so far&mdash;his Sacred Power was a fusion of spatial and dark energy, allowing the arrow to fly with the speed of teleportation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the Empyrean Sacredness, dodging Osborne's attack was nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quincy realized this too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed his divine power, channeling it into his blade in a desperate attempt to block the incoming arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arena erupted with a deafening blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, everyone watched in horror as Quincy screamed, the massive blade was sent flying, and he was thrown off the platform, unconscious from the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Sirius Sect's Osborne wins!" the referee announced.</span></p></div>
