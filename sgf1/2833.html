        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A hundred emperor fruits? Are you giving them to me?" Adriana stared at Osborne with wide eyes, unable to believe what she was seeing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne distributed emperor fruits to Isa, Clarissa, and others, she did feel a bit envious because these emperor fruits were also very useful to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Adriana said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Isa, Clarissa, and the others were the most important people to Osborne, including his women, sister, or best friends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was supposed to give them those emperor fruits to help them improve their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, those people were Adriana's disciples, and she was very happy they could benefit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she didn't expect Osborne to prepare even more emperor fruits for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana was completely stunned. She couldn't take her eyes off the hundred emperor fruits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Can a hundred emperor fruits help her reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made her breath quicken because that was Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the entire Racial Convergence Planet, no one had reached Imperial Empyrean Sacredness for tens of thousands of years. As long as she consumed these emperor fruits, she could easily break through her cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could Adriana possibly refuse?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't refuse, but she felt embarrassed to accept because these emperor fruits were just too precious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, these emperor fruits were far more precious than the Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor and Inferior Imperial Artifact Boxing Gloves Osborne had given her before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's indeed the case.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The exchange price for the Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor in the Celestial Spire is 10 billion battle points, while the Inferior Imperial Artifact Boxing Gloves require 5 billion battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the exchange price for one emperor fruit is 10 billion battle points!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Osborne gave Adriana a hundred emperor fruits, and these hundred emperor fruits could even be exchanged for a Superior Imperial Artifact Armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana bit her lower lip. She reached out several times to take it but stopped each time, her face full of conflict and struggle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, she looked at Osborne and gritted her teeth, "Osborne, do you know the value of these hundred emperor fruits? Do you know that any warrior at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level would even be willing to sell their life to you for these hundred emperor fruits? And you just give them to me like this? What do you want? Tell me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned. "Requirements? I have none. I know the value of emperor fruits. But I think the value of emperor fruits is not higher than the value of our friendship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, Ms. Alba, you once saved me and helped me. Back then, you didn't ask anything of me, did you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We are friends. You need emperor fruits now to reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, and I just happen to have them. If I don't give them to you, then who should I give them to?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, just take them without worry. I really have no demands."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked very sincere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, his words clearly didn't convince Adriana. She gritted her teeth and said, "Is it really just because we're friends? As for saving and helping you before, you've already repaid those debts. In Necropolis City, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been able to enter the Skyfall Casket and would have been killed by Emperor Frederick long ago."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you don't owe me anything. As for friendship... just because we're friends, would you directly give me a hundred emperor fruits? Are you crazy, or am I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne explained helplessly, "I really have no demands. Why don't you believe me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared intently at Adriana, as if wanting her to see his sincerity in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Adriana thought of something else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne staring intently at her body, her face turned red. She bit her lower lip and asked, "So, are you interested in my body? Just like what you just did with Isa, Clarissa, and the others, do you want to sleep with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana's face turned completely red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne was utterly shocked, thinking, "What does Ms. Alba mean? When was I ever interested in her body? When did I want to sleep with her? And what does she mean by her words?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be that she saw what I just did with Isa, Clarissa, and the others in the room? How is that possible? I clearly used my power to conceal it. But then again, this is Ms. Alba's territory. It's normal for her to be able to see what we did."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, even though Osborne was quite shameless, he couldn't help but blush at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And his blushing made Adriana misunderstand again. She thought Osborne was embarrassed because she hit the mark and even believed he was truly interested in her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's face turned even redder. She bit her lip and said, "There's nothing to be embarrassed about. If that's what you think, I'll agree to it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To be honest, if you gave these hundred emperor fruits to Emperor Frederick, he would definitely be willing to send all the princesses of the Royal Family to your bed. Even if you asked him to send Queen Callista to your bed, he would follow your words without hesitation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you gave these hundred emperor fruits to Evernight Court's Emperor Anthony or Phantom Commerce Guild's Emperor Russell, they would also send their daughters or wives to your bed without hesitation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, even if you're really interested in my body and want to sleep with me, your hundred emperor fruits are sincere enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Adriana reached out and collected the hundred emperor fruits. "So, come on!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although I am Isa, Clarissa, and the others' master, and sharing the same man with my disciples makes me a bit embarrassed, I can get used to it, can't I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana walked toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was stunned, thinking, "What is going on? Why did Ms. Alba agree? When did I ever say these hundred emperor fruits were to exchange for her body?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He explained, "Ms. Alba, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before he could finish, Adriana covered his mouth with her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana's face was very red. "Don't say anything. Before I change my mind, let's begin. Anyway, I've already accepted your emperor fruits. You're not allowed to back out either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, I never thought you'd dare to be interested in my body. I am Isa and Clarissa's master. You're so lecherous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana suddenly kissed Osborne's lips. Gently but firmly, she pushed Osborne down to the ground. Her cold lips instantly made Osborne's body react quickly, as if a current ran through him. In an instant, his manhood pressed against Adriana's lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was completely stunned, thinking, "No, I can't explain this anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still wanted to continue explaining, but Adriana had already quickly taken off her clothes, revealing her delicate skin and perfect body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne swallowed hard, instantly rendered speechless. He only felt a surge of boiling fire rush from his lower abdomen to his brain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's body was too perfect!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No men could turn her down. Not even Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he held Adriana's waist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's face turned even redder. In the end, she frowned slightly and slowly sat down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Adriana let out a pleasurable moan as she felt a fullness and satisfaction she had never experienced before. "Are you satisfied now?"</span></p></div>
