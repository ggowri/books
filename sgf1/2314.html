        <h1>Chapter 2262 The Top Sixteen Matches-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the fourth day of the city duel, the battles for the top sixteen finally commenced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arrived at the arena early, and the only others still seated in the competitors' area were Jamar and Bethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them wore serious expressions, a stark contrast to Osborne's relaxed demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne hadn't paid much attention to the group matches, Jamar and Bethan had been glued to every fight, knowing that each contender stood in the way of their goal to break into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at Osborne, all chill and carefree," Jamar sighed, a hint of envy in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the top sixteen contenders faced off, each participant would have to fight fifteen matches over the next three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a test of strength; it was also a challenge of strategy. Knowing when to fight and when to conserve energy was crucial. If they faced an opponent they had no chance of beating, it was better to forfeit than to risk exhaustion or injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Jamar and Bethan were hashing out which matches they ought to forfeit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan said, her brow knitted in deep thought, "Leroy is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with. As the clear favorite for the championship, we don't stand a snowball's chance against her. We might as well just forfeit that match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar chimed in, "Couldn't agree more. Marreese and Tyson both fight like wild animals. Even if there was a tiny glimmer of hope, it's not worth the risk of getting seriously hurt. We've got to think about the later rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then there's Clara... she's powerful, but she never really pulls out all the stops. She just uses that divine artifact chain to tie her opponents up. We could take a shot at her, but it'd burn up too much of our energy. It's better to pass on that one too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, and if we end up facing Pero..." Bethan paused for a moment before continuing, "We might as well skip Osborne as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their conversation made Osborne stifle a laugh, but he could see where they were coming from. Their aim was simply to make it into the top ten, and in theory, they only had to outperform six other competitors to reach that goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure was on, and they needed a well-thought-out strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, it wasn't just them. Everyone else in the running for a top-ten spot would follow suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcer boomed, "Ladies and gentlemen, the top-sixteen matches are about to kick off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First on the docket, we've got Pero from Azure Haven Academy squaring off against Tyson from Fantasia Isle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd went wild with cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excitement was practically tangible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, the opening match is a real heavy-hitter! Tyson was the runner-up last year, and Pero snagged third place! This showdown is going to be a real barnburner!" someone in the audience hollered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you reckon will come out on top?" another person asked, eyes wide with eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a toss-up! It's been a decade since then, and Tyson's definitely stepped up his game, but Pero's no slouch, either. It could go either way, and we might even see both of them end up banged up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they both go down, it could create an opening for someone else to come out of nowhere and seize the opportunity!" another voice piped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd hummed with wild guesses, Tyson and Pero took their stances on the arena floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson oozed an air of superiority. His very presence was so overwhelming that it felt like it could choke the life out of anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed a menacing glare on Pero. "Pero, let's cut the crap. You don't stand a chance against me. Just throw in the towel now. If I end up hurting you, it might mess up your chances in the later rounds. You might not even make it into the top five!" Tyson jeered, a smug smirk dancing on his lips.</span></p></div>
