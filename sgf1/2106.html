        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda hurried to catch up with Osborne. "Hey, don't change the subject!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously, you need to spill. How did you do it? If you don't tell me, I'll just keep bothering you! We're teammates now&mdash;</span><span>only the two of us left</span><span>! I need to understand your abilities to better plan our next moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, just let me in on it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so curious, and if you don't tell me, I won't be able to focus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda trailed Osborne, her words tumbling out in a steady stream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, somewhat exasperated by her relentless questions, finally relented. "Alright! Just tell me what you want to know, and I'll share."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile lit up Alfreda's face, brimming with triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's what I wanted to hear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, first things first: If you're really just an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, how on earth did you knock out Ascension Five warriors like Neville and Cyrus? That just doesn't add up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated, but then decided to explain, "I have special techniques that can suppress the cultivation levels of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can reduce two Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings like them down to Ascension Three! At that moment, they were completely out of control, madly attacking without a thought for defense, which gave me the perfect opportunity to take them down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda stared at him in disbelief. "You can suppress an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King to Ascension Three? Since I'm also Ascension Five, does that mean you could do the same to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, a serious expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't have any special methods to counter it, yes, that's how it works! On top of that, I can suppress Ascension Six down to Ascension Five, and anyone below Ascension Four down to Ascension One!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda was taken aback. "You have that kind of ability?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the news didn't faze her too much. She believed that even if Osborne could suppress her level to Ascension Three, she'd still be able to beat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she thought, "I scored Class SS on the Astral Testing Arch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fight at the same cultivation level, I've never really lost to anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne brought me down to Ascension One, I'm confident I could hold my own against him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her curiosity shifted back to Osborne's earlier feats. "But how did you spot the Phantom Worms?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their stealth is incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, a Nature Elf, can barely sense them at all, only catching hints of their locations when they attack. Yet, you seem to pinpoint their positions with alarming accuracy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "My eyes are a bit different from most. They allow me to see Phantom Worms clearly... though I'm not sure why."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh!" Alfreda nodded but didn't pry any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then how on earth did you sense the energy fluctuations of the Element Gold Crystal from 12 miles away? I can't even come close to that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, "I honestly don't know..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what about..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda peppered him with a barrage of questions while Osborne responded casually. When it came to secrets he couldn't reveal, he danced around them, offering vague answers. For the less critical inquiries, he didn't hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they delved deeper into the branch of the chasm, however, their luck took a turn for the worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After four long hours of exploration, they finally reached the end of the chasm, but to their disappointment, it was void of treasures. No Phantom Worms, no other dangers, and certainly no valuable finds awaited them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four hours had slipped away, wasted in the depths of the chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown as he looked up at the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a swirling mass of dark clouds, like ink spilled across the heavens, with ominous lightning flashing wildly, sending chills down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only we could fly above and search from the air! That would definitely boost our efficiency!" Osborne murmured, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda quickly interjected, "Fly? I'd advise against that! You'd have no idea how you'd end up dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With my cultivation level, I could barely manage to fly here in Umbra Earth. But my father warned me&mdash;the rules are different here. You absolutely cannot fly above 330 feet, or you'll attract those terrifying lightning strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even an Ascension Six or even Seven Supernal Deity King wouldn't stand a chance against those bolts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why even Uriel, the Oracle Heir, sticks to flying below 330 feet. We have to search this chasm on foot, step by step. No shortcuts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we could just fly freely in this chasm, do you really think we'd be here searching for treasures? The previous explorers would've cleaned out all the good stuff already."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, a hint of disappointment creeping into his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was merely lamenting the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without Alfreda's warning, he wouldn't have considered flying; the sight of those menacing lightning strikes was a stark reminder of the forbidden power he wasn't ready to confront.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can we increase our search efficiency?" he pondered, brow furrowed in concentration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exploring each branch like this would take an eternity&mdash;perhaps even a month wouldn't be enough to cover all the branches of the Death Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with a hundred exploration teams already scouring the area, how could they possibly outpace the competition and uncover more treasures?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment of contemplation, Osborne found himself at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Umbra Earth was simply too peculiar; every rock and patch of soil brimmed with a unique energy that rendered his spatial power ineffective for traversing through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it; I'll focus on boosting my strength for now!" he mused, pushing the frustrating thoughts aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He resolved to absorb the three Element Gold Crystals he had previously collected to enhance his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "One Dark Gold Crystal and one Lightning Gold Crystal should elevate my dark and lightning elemental essences to late Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My space elemental essence is already at late Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Spatial Gold Crystal, maybe I can push it to Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Achieving Level Ten would mean a significant transformation in my abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That might just help us in this predicament!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his plan set, Osborne turned to Alfreda. "I'd like to meditate here for a bit and absorb these Element Gold Crystals. Would that be alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda didn't hesitate. "No problem! Go ahead and absorb them! I'll keep watch. If anything happens, I'll give you a shout."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded appreciatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasting no time, he pulled out the Dark Gold Crystal, Lightning Gold Crystal, and Spatial Gold Crystal, and began the absorption process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt his three elemental essences rapidly elevated in power.</span></p></div>
