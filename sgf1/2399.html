        <h1>Chapter 2316 Hold Your Horses-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the blue, Osborne materialized beside Clara and Leroy. He sized them up in a jiffy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, they were okay, just sporting a few scratches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Jared's enraged yell, Osborne couldn't help but let out a sneering smirk, his face contorted with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jared, you thought you could take on my teammates without getting pay</span><span>back? Well, not only will I mess up your guys, but you're gonna pay through the nose for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he hoisted his Bloodwrought Bow and took dead aim at Jared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared's expression did a complete 180. A massive wave of pressure hit him, leaving him gobsmacked. After all, Osborne was only ranked 108th on the strength leaderboard, even lower than Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Jared was firmly in the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By all accounts, he should be way stronger than Osborne; beating Osborne should've been a walk in the park. He'd steamrolled guys around Osborne's rank without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, standing face-to-face with Osborne, he felt the heat&mdash;a real sense of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about Osborne's Sacred Power arrows made his heart pound. If it weren't for his defensive Sacred Artifact, he didn't even want to imagine what would've happened if he'd gotten hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he realized this, doubt started to gnaw at Jared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This guy is no joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There were rumors he bit the dust on the sixth layer, but here he is on the last day of the state duel. That means he must've survived down there for a solid six days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And with the firepower he's showing, he's definitely not someone to mess with. Even if we manage to take him out, it's gonna cost us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Right now, it's make or break for the top ten. I can't afford to waste any more time or let my teammates get hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Time to fall back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having made up his mind, Jared let out a disdainful scoff, clenching his teeth. "Fine, whatever! Since Leroy is also from one of the Eight Great Academies, I'll give you a pass today. I'm not gonna waste any more time on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Leroy, mark my words&mdash;if you screw up my chances of getting into the top ten and make it so the Eight Great Academies have no one in the top ten, you'll be in deep trouble! You'll pay for it! Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared signaled his team to leave, set on finding other targets to steal points from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne, Leroy, and Clara working as a unit, they'd become a real force to be reckoned with. Unless it was one of the top-notch teams, it'd be an uphill battle to take points from them. And even the elite teams would have to pay a heavy price if they tried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It just wasn't worth the hassle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in his mind, neither Osborne, Leroy nor Clara had a large number of points, with none of them having over a million. It would be a complete losing deal to seize their points at a great cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking it through, Jared decided to bite his tongue and pull back for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shouted, his voice dripping with mockery, "Leaving already? Hold your horses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You thought you could just come in here and then bounce?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that simple! You ganged up on my teammates to steal their points. Now that you know you're not gonna win, you want to run?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's the deal&mdash;you can leave, but you'll have to hand over ten percent of your points. I'm only letting you go because of Leroy. Otherwise, you'd not only lose your points but end up with some serious injuries too!"</span></p></div>
