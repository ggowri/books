        <h1>Chapter 2498 A Struggle</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered. Since he knew Angela could repair the Cosmic Translocator, there was no need to tolerate the people of Cobalt Island anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There&rsquo;s only this one Cosmic Translocator nearby. If people want to travel from here to Inferno Planet deep in Stellar Region M72, they can only use this Translocator. Taking a detour would take at least one or two months. So, the people of Cobalt Island deliberately damaged the Cosmic Translocator here, forcing those eager to reach Inferno Planet to hand over a large amount of resources and wealth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is essentially robbery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The people on Cobalt Island are essentially a group of Space Pirates, just robbing in a different way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne doesn&rsquo;t need to compromise with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You're right, we're all eager to use the Cosmic Translocator, and fixing it sooner benefits everyone. But unfortunately, we won't give you the resources or wealth you want."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dexter's face instantly darkened. "You won't give? Then leave this place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and shook his head, "We won't give you resources or wealth, nor will we leave. The ones who need to leave are you bandits from Cobalt Island."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dexter couldn't help but laugh and teased, "What nonsense are you spouting? You're calling us bandits? Your words have made us very angry, so we've decided not to repair the Cosmic Translocator. Unless you offer double the resources and wealth and apologize to us, no one will get to use this Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Dexter looked at the others from different factions and said, "Everyone, you can't blame us for this. He's too arrogant. Not only is he unwilling to share the resources to repair the Cosmic Translocator, but he even insulted us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you might miss the Phantomagic Realm. But if you want to blame someone, blame them. Unless they hand over double the resources, no one is leaving. Just wait here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Dexter looked at Osborne with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne instantly felt many angry gazes directed at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Apologize to the people of Cobalt Island."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're in a hurry to get to Inferno Planet, to Phantomagic Realm. If the Cosmic Translocator can't be repaired in time because of you and we miss the schedule, we won't let you off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right, apologize to the people of Cobalt Island immediately, hand over double the resources, and earn their forgiveness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up, don't waste our time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, even without the people of Cobalt Island taking action, we won't spare you either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Except for Azael and his group, people from the other factions were all forcing Osborne, Agatha, and Angela to apologize and hand over double the resources with cold expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael was a bit anxious. He looked at Agatha worriedly, afraid she might suffer a loss because of this, and kept signaling her desperately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, Agatha ignored him and just looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael quickly communicated through Telepathy, "Osborne, don't act impulsively. Everyone knows the people from Cobalt Island are bandits, but they have six advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors. Even if we join forces, we can barely hold our ground against them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, only the people from Cobalt Island can repair the Cosmic Translocator right now. Just apologize quickly. While resources and wealth are important, they are nothing compared to your lives."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced at Azael but didn't respond.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Dexter and said calmly, "Nice try. You think everyone is eager to use the Cosmic Translocator, and since only you can repair it, you can threaten everyone to meet your demands?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ridiculous. I don't care about others, but I absolutely won't agree. Now, I'll give you ten seconds to get out of here, or else, it's war."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished speaking and instantly drew the Bloodwrought Bow, gripping it tightly in his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he also summoned Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash had already taken the form of a warhorse by now, still retaining its three pairs of wings. Osborne patted Flash's head and sneered as he looked at Cobalt Island's Dexter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dexter was stunned. He looked at Osborne in disbelief, thinking he must have misheard. Did Osborne just say to give them ten seconds to leave? Or else they would go to war?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Has Osborne gone mad?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hadn't even reached Empyrean Sacredness. Agatha and Angela had only reached mid Empyrean Sacredness and primary Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Cobalt Island had six advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors, over a dozen mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors, and dozens of primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Dexter's view, even if everyone present joined forces, they wouldn't be a match for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne actually told them to get lost and dared to start a war with them?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others from Cobalt Island behind Dexter were stunned, then burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even people from other forces like Azael were stunned at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael's elder glared fiercely at Azael. "Azael, these three are lunatics. You actually went up to befriend them just now? They're doomed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael opened his mouth but couldn't say a word.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he also felt that Osborne was probably crazy; this was clearly a deliberate act of seeking death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt sorry for Agnes being dragged down by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone looked at Osborne as if he were a fool, but Osborne's expression remained calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said calmly, "There are still eight seconds left."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seven seconds."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Six seconds."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Five seconds."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne unleashed a powerful fighting spirit, and the Bloodwrought Bow began gathering energy, forming ten dazzling Sacred Power Arrow phantoms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow, ten arrows fired simultaneously."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression was icy. With each second he counted down, the Sacred Power Arrow on the Bloodwrought Bow became more concentrated. However, under extreme compression, the Sacred Power fluctuations appeared very faint.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In everyone's perception, it seemed as if these Sacred Power Arrows had no power at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The people of Cobalt Island were all sneering at Osborne at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dexter also sneered, "Foolish. We originally didn't plan to kill anyone this time. But since you're asking for trouble, don't blame me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, the Sacred Power around Dexter began to surge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power fluctuations of an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior were incredibly terrifying. In comparison, the arrow on Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow seemed utterly insignificant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne remained calm. "Three seconds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Two seconds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One second."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "Since you insist on staying here to rob us, then go to hell!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, the ten arrows on Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow fully formed, radiating brilliant light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ten arrows were now all aimed at Dexter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dexter is an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was three cultivation levels higher than Osborne, but Osborne showed no fear or retreat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne made his move. As he released the bowstring, the ten Sacred Power Arrows shot out simultaneously, vanishing from everyone's sight and then reappearing in front of Dexter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ten highly compressed Sacred Power Arrows exploded simultaneously.</span></p></div>
