        <h1>Chapter 1705 Arrangements in Place</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a matter of minutes, everyone had returned to their normal state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a moment to assess their progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was pleased to find that most had successfully grasped Level One of the Eclipsing Mantra, with many already on the cusp of reaching Level Two. A little more time and </span><span>mastering Level Two wouldn't pose a challenge for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A select few had even managed to master Level Two outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These individuals clearly exhibited higher aptitude and talent, ensuring that they would progress without any issues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what truly astonished Osborne was the revelation that some had actually attained Level Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their exceptional talent left him pleasantly surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, even among Chandler, Angelo, Arnold, and Mariah, only Chandler had directly grasped Level Three; the others had only managed Level Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was important to note that achieving the status of Deity King warrior required top-tier talent and insight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the aid of rare treasures like the Miracle Elixir or Celestial Crystals, only genuine super-geniuses could hope to ascend to the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo, Arnold, and Mariah were undoubtedly super-geniuses, but Chandler's abilities surpassed theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the stronghold, twelve others had also mastered the Eclipsing Mantra at Level Three, indicating that their aptitude might be on par with Chandler's, possibly even surpassing that of Angelo, Arnold, and Mariah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, hundreds had achieved Level Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instructed, "These twelve need to be closely monitored! We should allocate more Celestial Crystals to them and ensure their safety. While maintaining the stronghold's operations, avoid assigning them any dangerous tasks. Let them focus entirely on their cultivation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps they'll surprise me and break through to become Deity Kings! And those few hundred who have grasped Level Two should also be watched closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With enough resources, they too could have a shot at becoming Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, my Lord," they replied in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Additionally, I'll be leaving the base in a few days. Arrange for someone to impersonate me so that my 'identity' can continue to earn merit and rise through the ranks within the Wild Flame Army," Osborne added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo nodded</span><span> with</span><span> a confident smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My lord, that's easy! We'll find someone to disguise as you, and they'll keep racking up accomplishments. The entire base is under our control, so there won't be any issues!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before long, you'll be the leader of ten thousand, maybe even a brigadier general!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's within my top authority!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded approvingly. "Good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving a few more instructions, he waved the four away. He decided to linger for another couple of days to ensure everything in the base was running smoothly before heading back to Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he wouldn't be leaving as Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, I'll have some time to myself! It's about time I started searching for clues about my parents," Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been in Celestara for over three months, caught up in the whirlwind of </span><span>establishing himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had worked tirelessly to elevate his realm and status, but he never lost sight of the primary reason for his journey to Celestara</span><span>, </span><span>finding his parents!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's thoughts turned to his parents, Theodore and Vivienne. The last place they had vanished was the dimensional portal leading to Celestara. It was highly likely they had arrived in Celestara decades ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of anxiety washed over him. "Are my parents still alive?" The Human Community in Celestara was in dire straits, with powerful Deathborns lurking in the wilderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they had come from Blue Planet, his parents were only Class AA and Class AAA</span><span>, </span><span>far from being Class S. In Celestara, even Junior Deities and Intermediate Deities struggled to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could they really still be alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip, worry gnawing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter if you're alive or not, I will do everything in my power to find any news about you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His resolve was unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne commanded all the Blood Clan descendants to use their connections within their respective families to investigate his father, Theodore, and his mother, Vivienne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Blood Clan members hailed from various powerful factions in East Zone Nine, and if his parents were anywhere in that region, they would surely uncover some leads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to pursue his own path to find his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Back to Wild Flame City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, my name is Theodore Augustine! I want the name Theodore to echo throughout East Zone Nine and even across the entire East Zone! It should resonate through Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If my parents are still alive, they might come looking for me once they hear my name!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he knew that simply adopting the name Theodore wouldn't suffice; there were bound to be many with the same name. Osborne needed a partner to help him make a name for himself in Celestara, someone who could carry his mother's name, Vivienne, alongside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a name flashed in his mind</span><span>. </span><span>Anastasia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only someone with Anastasia's talent and strength could stand beside him and help make their names known throughout Celestara.</span></p></div>
