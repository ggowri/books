        <h1>Chapter 2302 Frost-kissed Heart</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes locked onto it&mdash;an ice crystal hanging in the fog, shaped like a perfect teardrop. Excitement lit up his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been dead set on finding the Frost-kissed Heart buried somewhere in the mountain, hadn't he? Hours he'd spent with Satan's Eye, its X-ray vision peeling back layers of snow and rock, inch by painstaking inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what did Osborne get for his trouble? Zilch. Nada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, out of the blue, he spots this anomaly hanging in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frozen ice crystal, tucked away amongst the billions of water droplets making up the fog. If he weren't paying attention, it was practically invisible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably wouldn't have even noticed it, if he hadn't been temporarily blinded by that freak flash of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little thing was perfectly camouflaged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a sneaking suspicion that this was the Frost-kissed Heart he'd been hunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trouble was, he hadn't got a clue what a Frost-kissed Heart was supposed to look like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I'll know soon enough, won't I?" he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne approached the shimmering ice crystal and reached out a hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in that instant, Satan's Eye went haywire, practically screaming a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze, hand hovering in the air.</span><br><span>The danger's coming from the Frost-kissed Heart itself? Guess that means no touching, huh? Or things could get messy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, carefully, Osborne channeled a stream of Sacred Power, intending to wrap the little ice crystal in its protective glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened next was a shocker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant his Sacred Power brushed against the ice crystal, it froze solid, just like that! The icy power threatened to spread through his Sacred Power, like a virus, heading straight for his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a terrifying cold trying to invade him, reaching for his very core. He snapped the connection to his Sacred Power, severing the link, and the bizarre sensation vanished as quickly as it had come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Holy crap, what ice power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It can freeze my Sacred Power, and then use it to freeze me! If Satan's Eye hadn't warned me, and I'd tried to grab it with my bare hands, I'd probably be an ice sculpture by now.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was visibly shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's </span><span>gotta</span><span> be the Frost-kissed Heart! Nothing else could pack that kind of freezing punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned serious, a deep frown etching itself onto his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>This Frost-kissed Heart is truly terrifying. I can't even approach it with my physical body or my Sacred Power. Anything that comes into contact with it freezes solid. So, how on earth am I supposed to take it away?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>And how can one even make use of this Frost-kissed Heart?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The ice power it possesses is so overwhelming that it would freeze your body, soul, and mind in an instant. Trying to use it to strengthen my body or speed up the fusion process?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's practically a death wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found himself in a real bind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he made up his mind to seek help from Primordial. Primordial was an offshoot of the World Tree, having inherited some of its memories, so there was a chance it knew how to handle the Frost-kissed Heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne roused Primordial from its slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial took the form of a tiny tree-man and materialized in front of Osborne. In an instant, a layer of ice crystals coated his body, leaving him frozen and rigid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only when a peculiar energy welled up from within </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> body that the ice crystals encasing him melted away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's</span><span> voice quivered a bit. "Ah! So cold! I nearly turned into an ice block! Osborne, what kind of place have you dragged me to? How can it be this freezing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial stared at Osborne, utterly bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time and quickly filled him in on the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frost-kissed Heart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial was utterly flabbergasted. He gaped at the unassuming little ice crystal hovering in mid-air. "That's truly a Frost-kissed Heart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know what it is?" Osborne was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial said, "Oh, I know a thing or two about Frost-kissed Hearts! They're treasures of the world, forged in seriously extreme, icy environments!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And get this&mdash;they're a total power-up for spiritual plants like us! If I could absorb that Frost-kissed Heart, my strength would skyrocket, and I'd even develop an ice elemental power!" A glint of greed flashed in his eyes as he said this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne eyed him, skeptical. "A powerful effect on spiritual plants, huh? You sure you're not just trying to bamboozle me out of the Frost-kissed Heart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial rolled his eyes, exasperated. "I'm bonded to your Soul Current Ocean, remember?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your gains are my gains, and vice versa! Why would I try to swindle you? Besides, the Frost-kissed Heart isn't just beneficial to me; it's even better for you! You are fused with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, after all. In a way, your second form is practically a spiritual plant...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The effect of using the Frost-kissed Heart will be ten times stronger for you than anyone else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ten times stronger than for anyone else?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Frost-kissed Heart already kicks the physical body into high gear. Agatha wouldn't have risked coming here otherwise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If it's ten times more potent for me, then its value just went through the roof!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, spill it. How do I use it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial looked him dead in the eye. "You </span><span>gotta</span><span> promise me something first. If you find more Frost-kissed Hearts, you've </span><span>gotta</span><span> share the love. Then, and only then, will I tell you how to use it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded without missing a beat. "Don't sweat it! You and I are a package deal. What's mine is yours. Find more Frost-kissed Hearts, and you can bet your ass you'll get your share."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial nodded, satisfied. "Now, here's the thing&mdash;you need a special technique to use the Frost-kissed Heart! Mess it up, and you're looking at serious danger&mdash;could even get yourself killed! Luckily for you, I happen to know the perfect method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that method is to eat it raw!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes bugged out. "Eat it directly? Are you yanking my chain? I'd freeze solid the second I touched it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial gave a calm smile. "When I say eat it, I don't mean munching on it like a snack! I'm talking about using the roots of our spiritual plants to 'eat' it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like using the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity... or the Chaotic Spiritual Root of the World Tree to slurp up the power of the Frost-kissed Heart, nice and easy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My roots can do it too, you know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. "Alright, sounds like a plan! I'll give it a shot. But you better not be feeding me a load of crap. If I end up frozen solid, you're going down with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial rolled his eyes again. "If you're so worried, I can go first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said it, several tree roots sprouted from </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> body, eyeing the Frost-kissed Heart with undisguised eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "No need. I got this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a mass of dense, blood-red roots erupted from Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Invisible to others but palpable to Osborne, the roots, under his control, crept steadily towards the Frost-kissed Heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ready for anything. If the roots started to freeze, he'd know </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> method was a bust. He'd simply sever the connection, no harm done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as luck would have it, his worries were unfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood-red roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity plunged into the Frost-kissed Heart with ease, feeling absolutely no icy power whatsoever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, a tidal wave of power was "eaten" into Osborne's body through the roots.</span></p></div>
