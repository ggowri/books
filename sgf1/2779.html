        <h1>Chapter 2635 New Discovery-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, we meet again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby's voice echoed in Osborne's mind, seeming more lively than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't pay much attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He directly asked, "Toby, I've passed the eighteenth trial. Can you give me the key to the Skyfall Casket now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said calmly, "The key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket is on the eighteenth level. As long as you clear the eighteenth level, you can obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, the four of you cleared it together. If the other three agree to let you keep the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, I can give it to you directly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Toby fell silent for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps he is communicating with Clara, Leroy, and Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Toby said, "The three of them agreed to let me give you the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, so here, take it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Toby finished speaking, Osborne noticed a faint red light appear in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the red light flickered, a space rift opened in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, something emerged from the space rift.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a spear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blood-stained bronze spear looked very ordinary, and Osborne didn't sense any overwhelming energy. However, for some reason, the moment he saw the spear, Osborne couldn't help but widen his eyes. His entire body&rsquo;s blood seemed to boil, as if it was about to surge out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear. As long as you insert it into the corresponding keyhole of the Eighth Skyfall Casket, you can open it and gain the qualification to venture into the Eighth Skyfall Casket," Toby said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Violet-blooded Bronze Spear? The key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket is a spear?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, gripping the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear with his hand. Instantly, he felt a chilling aura of slaughter surge from the bronze spear into his body. His body stiffened immediately, and the skin on his palm felt an intense sting, as if it were being corroded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly let go of the spear, as if a moment's delay would destroy his arm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately looked at the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear in astonishment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What level of weapon is this?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Man, even though most of the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear's power is sealed, it's still equivalent to an Imperial Artifact. Moreover, its quality is excellent. With your current strength, you can't control or use it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Put it away. Maybe in the Eighth Skyfall Casket, you can find a way to repair the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear and restore its power from the Primeval War."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Toby finished speaking, Osborne felt utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this an Imperial Artifact? And of excellent quality? Most importantly, is most of its power sealed? What level was it originally?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It is a Sovereign Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It used to be the highest-level Sovereign Artifact in the cosmos. Unfortunately, it was damaged during the Primeval War, so its power had to be sealed to prevent it from shattering."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Toby finished speaking, Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sovereign Artifact?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial once said that the strongest people in the cosmos are called Masters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their cultivation level has all reached Sovereign Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, Drum's mother, the empress Kira, who ruled the cosmos for countless years, was known as the strongest Master.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't expect this Violet-blooded Bronze Spear to be a Sovereign Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It is the highest-grade Sovereign Artifact in the cosmos. Unfortunately, it was damaged during the Primeval War, so its power could only be sealed in the end, preventing it from shattering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even so, this Violet-blooded Bronze Spear still possesses the power of Imperial Artifacts.</span></p></div>
