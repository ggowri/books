        <h1>Chapter 2552 Reunion with Clara and Leroy-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Osborne found a regular hotel not far from the Empire Hotel. As long as he activated Satan's Eye, he could clearly see the situation inside the Empire Hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, from here, he could also see part of the Palace and part of the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when Osborne tried to use Satan's Eye to spy, he discovered that both the Palace and the Royal Sepulcher were surrounded by a powerful defensive shield, blocking his view.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, it's the Palace and Royal Sepulcher of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the most important places in the Glorious Divine Kingdom. It's normal that my Satan's Eye can't see through."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't pay much attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, in ten days, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel will begin, and a sacrificial ceremony will also be held in the Royal Sepulcher. By then, all the princes and princesses of the Royal Family will be present, and all his enemies will show up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Clara and Leroy arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Entering Osborne's small courtyard and seeing him, they showed a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had used the Sublime Concealment Orb to alter his aura and appearance, so they weren't sure if the person before them was really him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and reverted to his original appearance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the two women&rsquo;s faces lit up with excitement and joy. &ldquo;We knew you&rsquo;d be fine! Where have you been all this time? We couldn&rsquo;t reach you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit awkward upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the time, he was far away from Racial Convergence Planet, and Clara and Leroy's terminal levels weren't high enough to reach him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne returned to Racial Convergence Planet, he forgot they were still worried about him and didn&rsquo;t take the initiative to contact them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only say, &ldquo;I went far away, beyond the terminal&rsquo;s communication range! I just returned to Racial Convergence Planet today&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn&rsquo;t think much of it and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, don't be upset! Those Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, if taken, so be it! You have strength and talent, as long as you're alive, nothing else matters."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned upon hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where did you hear that my Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were stolen?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They exchanged a glance. "Everyone knows!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's said that your Kingdom Duel Badge was taken by someone named 'Lionel Lawson.' That Lionel was chased by others for a long time before finally escaping."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, we still don't know where Lionel is hiding!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, they were all furious. "Damn Lionel, don't let us find out his true identity! Once we're strong enough, we'll definitely avenge you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So that's how it is!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, he was caught by Lionel and cornered in front of the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign. Indeed, he made a deal with Lionel. He traded the Kingdom Duel Badge for Lionel's Supreme Sacred Artifact&mdash;the Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, the Void Sword was obtained, but the Kingdom Duel Badge that Lionel got...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was swapped by Osborne at the last moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's just a pity that Lionel didn't know at the time. He thought he had truly obtained Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge. Unwilling to share it with anyone, he fled frantically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of this, everyone was certain that Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge had been taken by Lionel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Clara and Leroy thought so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "My Kingdom Duel Badge contains your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, over three billion each! Don't you really blame me for losing your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints?"</span></p></div>
