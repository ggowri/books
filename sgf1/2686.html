        <h1>Chapter 2562 Disappearance</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are indeed many formations protecting the Royal Sepulcher, but it&rsquo;s not as dangerous as Justina claimed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as he doesn't directly excavate the tombs in the Royal Sepulcher, he won't trigger any formations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne smoothly arrived at the edge of the Royal Sepulcher, where there were many tombs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t pay attention to these tombs. The ones buried here were mostly less important members of the Glorious Divine Kingdom&rsquo;s Royal Family, and even some branch bloodline members of the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For them, being buried in the Royal Sepulcher, even just at the edge, was already an unparalleled great honor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Michelle was buried here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne looked at Michelle's tomb with immense excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, Osborne froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body suddenly stopped in place, as if petrified, completely motionless, because at this moment, there was nothing at Michelle's tomb site.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Michelle's tomb was gone!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was absolutely certain that Michelle was buried here. Over a thousand years ago, after Michelle was executed, he personally laid her to rest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he were to reincarnate a hundred times, Osborne would never forget the burial site. He even remembered the tombstones of the other nearby graves with absolute clarity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, those tombstones remained unchanged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Michelle's tombstone was gone. Not only was the tombstone missing, there was nothing there at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could this happen? How could this happen?" Osborne murmured, his eyes filled with anxiety.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He went through great effort to enter the Royal Sepulcher and finally arrived at Michelle's tomb to pay his respects, only to find that Michelle's tomb was gone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remains belonging to Michelle in the tomb were also gone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Where did my mother's remains go? Were they moved somewhere else?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't know the answers to these two questions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Sepulcher was so vast that without the effect of Satan's Eye, it was impossible for Osborne to find Michelle's tomb and remains among the many tombs in the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he only had ten minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Osborne didn't believe anyone in the Glorious Divine Kingdom would voluntarily move Michelle's tomb to a better spot in the Royal Sepulcher. That was simply impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "My mother was executed by the direct order of the Glorious Divine Emperor. It's already fortunate that she was allowed to be buried in a remote spot in the Royal Sepulcher. My mother had no other children. Who would move her tomb for her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne clenched his teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A suspicion he didn&rsquo;t want to believe flashed through his mind&mdash;that Michelle's tomb had been destroyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt his feet unbearably heavy. He walked step by step to where Michelle's tomb should have been, then squatted down and gently touched the surrounding soil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed no one had been here for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter what the situation is, I'll see it for myself," Osborne gritted his teeth, cold words slipping through his clenched jaw. "Time Retrace!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne's Satan's Eye burst out a beam of light. He activated his time powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He intended to use Time Retrace to see what exactly happened here, to find out how Michelle's tomb disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wanted to know who had destroyed Michelle's tomb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, time around him rapidly rewound. Osborne saw countless scenes from the past. These scenes flashed quickly but remained normal throughout.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One year!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fifty years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One hundred years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth and quickly rewound time to a hundred years ago. But the scene he saw was still empty. This place was the same a hundred years ago, with no Michelle's tomb and no one ever having been here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "A hundred years is still not enough. Then I'll keep going!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth and unleashed his time powers wildly. Fortunately, his strength had grown far beyond before, and he had mastered Time Retrace much better than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to rewind time this far.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One hundred and fifty years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two hundred years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three hundred years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's forehead was sweating, and Satan's Eye kept twitching. After rewinding to three hundred years ago, Osborne felt the pressure, and Satan's Eye was nearing its limit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne still saw nothing. He didn&rsquo;t see Michelle&rsquo;s tomb, nor did he see anyone who had been there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Then I'll continue! No matter what, I must find out what happened here. I must know who destroyed my mother's tomb."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne clenched his teeth, his eyes bloodshot. "If three hundred years isn't enough, then I'll rewind time to five hundred years ago! If five hundred years isn't enough, then I'll rewind to a thousand years ago! No matter what, I must figure out what happened."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne fully activated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time powers were the abilities granted to Osborne by Satan's Eye. At this moment, Satan's Eye was nearing its limit, but Osborne refused to give up. He was determined to squeeze out all of Satan's Eye's power. He had to keep rewinding time to see exactly when Michelle's tomb disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this issue can't be resolved, Osborne will never give up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, time continued to rewind. But Osborne's Satan's Eye was already trembling violently. It was signaling Osborne that it had reached its limit and could no longer unleash greater power to rewind time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, it had to stop. But Osborne refused. He ignored Satan's Eye's trembling, gritted his teeth, and kept rewinding time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sweat poured down his forehead, his eyes turned bloodshot, and his entire body seemed affected. Even his Soul Current Ocean trembled violently. His once calm golden soul power was now surging with raging winds and waves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Four hundred years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Five hundred years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Five hundred years ago, Michelle's tomb was already gone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Six hundred years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seven hundred years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a snap, Osborne seemed to hear the sound of Satan's Eye cracking like a glass bead at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Primordial appeared on Osborne's shoulder. Seeing Osborne's current state, Primordial was shocked and anxiously shouted at Osborne, "Are you crazy?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop it right now. You're squeezing Satan's Eye's potential. If you keep this up, your Satan's Eye will collapse. This has already exceeded Satan's Eye's limit. If you continue, not only will Satan's Eye collapse, but your body will also face problems. Stop immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A look of hesitation appeared on Osborne's face. But in the end, he clenched his teeth and said, "I can't stop!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My mother's tomb has disappeared. I must find out who destroyed my mother's tomb. I need to know where my mother's remains went and who desecrated her remains."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must know what they're trying to do."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne continued to push Satan's Eye's abilities. At this point, he had already rewound time to over seven hundred years ago, while Michelle's exact burial time was eleven hundred years ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Now there's less than four hundred years left. As long as I use Time Retrace to rewind to the time my mother was buried, I will surely find out who destroyed my mother's tomb and remains after her burial."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne kept holding on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he could hear more clearly the sound of Satan's Eye cracking. The intense pain made Osborne's body tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he refused to stop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eight hundred years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nine hundred years!</span></p></div>
