        <h1>Chapter 2239 Farewell-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Osborne, by refusing the chance to be her registered disciple, he wouldn't exactly fall into obscurity, but there was no way he could keep up with Isa, Clarissa, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in their strengths would widen in a flash, and he'd be left in the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the strength gap got too wide, even the closest of relationships could turn into faded memories, with no room left for a real connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Adriana didn't understand why Osborne had turned down her offer, she couldn't help thinking he'd made a bone-headed decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, take good care of yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go looking for women out there! Wait for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay safe, Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make sure to drop by the Fairy Moon Sect whenever you can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One after another, they hugged him and said their goodbyes, their eyes shiny with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his own eyes start to water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The farewell weighed heavily on his heart, but deep down, Osborne knew what was really bothering him&mdash;he just wasn't strong enough. If he had the kind of power Adriana had, he could have guided them himself, and they wouldn't have to part ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip, swallowing back the surge of sorrow as he waved his hand. "Alright, let's get going! Don't keep Ms. Alba waiting! Don't you worry about me. I'll be just fine! And I promise I'll swing by the Fairy Moon Sect whenever I can!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I find out you're slacking off or your progress is lagging, I won't cut you any slack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group fell quiet, just staring at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana chimed in, her voice firm, "Okay, it's time to move!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This short-term separation is just a stepping-stone to a longer reunion down the road. As long as you all live up to my strength expectations, I'll make sure you can leave the Fairy Moon Sect to meet up with Osborne again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's make our way back to the Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, the sadness in their eyes grew deeper, but they had no choice but to turn around and slowly shuffle over to Adriana's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in their eyes and trickled down their cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne struggled to keep his emotions in check as he waved </span><span>goodbye to</span><span> </span><span>Isa, Clarissa, Emma, Austin, Anita, Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Kendra, Diana, Hannah, and Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goodbye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's roll!" Adriana didn't waste a single moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful energy wrapped around them, and mysterious patterns materialized in the air, giving rise to a colossal Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a soft hum, in the blink of an eye, they were gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne felt as if all his energy had been sapped away. He stood there, in a daze, his eyes fixed on the spot where they'd just been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela walked up and gave his shoulder a gentle pat. "Having second thoughts about your decision?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can feel how much you're </span><span>gonna</span><span> miss them! But why didn't you want to go with Ms. Alba to the Fairy Moon Sect? Why not stick with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snapped out of his reverie at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, not keen on explaining. All that filled his mind was the fact that he was now here alone among those who'd come to the Racial Convergence Planet with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of sadness washed over Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only console himself with the idea that this brief separation was for the sake of a more wonderful reunion down the road. It was the best-case scenario he could envision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne managed a forced smile. "I'm good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen, from now on, I'll be an inner disciple at Peak Seven of the Mystic Sirius Sect. So, I'm counting on you to watch my back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela stared at him, her expression pensive and solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment of silence, she finally nodded. "Don't fret; they'll be in safe hands at the Fairy Moon Sect! As for you... I'll be training at the Mystic Sirius Sect for a while. If you ever get into a bind, just come and find me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she took out a token. "This is my Peak Lord Token. With this, you can drop by my place whenever you like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After handing it over to him, Angela disappeared in a flash.</span></p></div>
