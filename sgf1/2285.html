        <h1>Chapter 2244 Single Strike-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In each group of fourteen, only the last person standing would advance to the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to deny that this format carried a hefty dose of luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone ended up in a group with the likes of Vadim, Jamar, or Bethan, his chances of progressing were virtually nil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he had the potential to break into the top ten, facing off against them would likely end his hopes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To mitigate such misfortune, </span><span>the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect had set up safeguards&mdash;last tournament's top ten participants would be seeded and wouldn't be grouped together during the draw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne stepped onto the ring, he scanned the faces of his thirteen opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his relief, Vadim, Jamar, and Bethan were nowhere to be seen, nor were any of the top ten from the last tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt little concern, but he noticed the relief washing over the others, their excitement bubbling just beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their group, there weren't any big-name favorites. That meant every single person had a real shot at shining and snagging a spot in the top twenty. Just making it that far would score them some sweet rewards from their Peak Lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> nail it! I'm taking the top prize in Group Five!" one contestant boasted, his eyes practically sparking with self-assurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, right! Not on my watch! That top spot's mine for the taking!" another retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're living in a fantasy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's stop talking and start fighting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with competition as the thirteen participants got ready to rumble. They were all familiar with one another, and no one was about to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that things were about to get heated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, back at Peak Seven, Angela was eyeing the action across all ten arenas, and her worry was mounting. Her forehead creased when she caught sight of something that set off alarm bells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! Zebedee </span><span>Daddario</span><span> was our best bet for the top twenty, but he's landed in the same group as Bethan! His chances are toast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elders around her let out heavy sighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Zebedee really got unlucky this time. If he'd been in Group Five, he'd have had a proper shot at moving on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For sure. Group Five seems like the softest group! We've got Areli and Osborne in there, but Areli's definitely not strong enough to make it. And as for Osborne, he's just an inner disciple. He only signed up as an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King to fill a spot. He's just a placeholder; there's no way he'll go far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another Elder let out a long sigh and shook his head. "Looks like Peak Seven's </span><span>gonna</span><span> get wiped out again. We might not have anyone in the top twenty this time again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's expression soured at their defeatist talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been through this twice before and was almost getting numb to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the idea of Peak Seven not having a single representative in the top twenty for three tournaments in a row was beyond humiliating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was zip she could do; all Angela could do was cross her fingers for a miracle, for a surprise underdog to step up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let the group battles kick off!" an Elder overseeing the matches announced, and the arena came alive with action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Group Five, the fight got underway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, calm and focused, when out of the blue, a figure popped up a short way off&mdash;it was Areli.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Areli shot Osborne a sneering </span><span>look</span><span> full of contempt. "You think you can just waltz in here as a placeholder inner disciple and diss me? I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget! You'll be laid up in bed after I'm through with you!"</span></p></div>
