        <h1>Chapter 2284 Invitations-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me start by introducing myself. I'm Gustave Fanny. These four are the teammates I've recruited. This is Quintina..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave then introduced the four people standing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly realized that these four were no slouches. They were all ranked within the top 200 on the strength rankings. And those in the top 200 were nothing to scoff at. After all, Osborne himself was only ranked 108th, and Clara was barely hanging on to the top 300.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the eyes of the Zephyr State officials, Gustave, Quintina, and the rest were all stronger than Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave, in particular, was even more powerful than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could tell that Gustave's introduction of his teammates was a subtle flex, a way to show off the team's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Gustave continued, "I'm well aware that on my own, there's no way I can break into the top ten in the state duel. That's why I'm pulling out all the stops to recruit more powerful warriors to join our team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't rope in those ranked in the top hundred, so I've set my sights on assembling a team of at least ten warriors ranked within the top two hundred. That way, I still stand a fair chance of making it into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm wondering, are you game?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a smile and then gave his head a shake. "Sorry, but I'll have to pass. I've already made plans to team up with someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave couldn't hide his disappointment. "All right then! I won't trouble you any further."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gustave and his entourage took their leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before there was another knock on Osborne's courtyard door. Once again, it was someone looking to recruit Osborne for their team. This time, the offer was pretty much the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how things turned out, he'd get 50 thousand Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the recruiter made it into the top ten, the reward would jump to 100 thousand Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned down the offer once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then came the third group of recruiters, followed by the fourth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had rebuffed four waves of people trying to rope him into their teams, and he was starting to get fed up. But the onslaught didn't stop there. The fifth wave showed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was someone he knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Leroy in surprise. "What, are you here to ask me to join your team too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy grinned. "Looks like a bunch of folks have already come calling, but you've shot them all down. Well, I'm not here to recruit you. I've already got my team sorted... Besides, I'm just playing a supporting role, helping others go for the top ten. Why would I ask you to join?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief. "Then what brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy said, "I'm here to express my gratitude!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During the city duel, I was hit by the backlash of the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance and went into a frenzy. All I could think about at that moment was beating you, even killing you! If you hadn't knocked me out in the nick of time, I would have suffered severe internal injuries that could have hampered my future potential. So, thanks for stepping in and helping me back then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "I knocked you out and snatched the championship from you. And yet you're thanking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy's face turned serious. "Let's keep things separate! You earned that championship fair and square with your own skills! Back then, you didn't have to take the quick route to defeat me. If you'd just stalled for a bit, I'd have been finished. But you still put yourself at risk to knock me out. You basically saved my skin!</span></p></div>
