        <h1>Chapter 1470 Hybrid Slave</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana spoke candidly, "But if a Deity Overlord warrior comes after you, we might not be able to save you in time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their power is far beyond yours&mdash;you're merely at the Transcendent Deity level, and you'd struggle to withstand even a single blow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you're a Super VIP, we can't assign a Deity Overlord warrior to protect you around the clock."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if the worst happens, even if we want to help, we might just be too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words drew scoffs from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he spends 100 million, he can't get a Deity Overlord warrior's protection! This guy thinks that scoring some ancient deity's treasure and a pile of Essence Crystals makes him untouchable now that he's a super VIP."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's rich! No wonder he dared to provoke Fabian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now he probably regrets ever stepping up. I bet he'll be begging for mercy soon enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must definitely be regretting it now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chose to ignore their jeers and pressed on with his questioning. "So if a Deity Overlord warrior targets me, you all just stand by? That Super VIP status sounds pretty useless, doesn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana shook her head, her tone firm. "Of course, we won't just sit idly by."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As a super VIP, you'll receive our protection. Generally, people will think twice before messing with you, but there are always those who are reckless&mdash;like Fabian! If he really comes after you, we won't let him get away unscathed. We'll make him pay a hefty price for his actions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That being said, don't expect us to help you kill Fabian or seek revenge; that's simply not possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded thoughtfully. "Got it! So, becoming a Super VIP is mostly a deterrent. If a Deity Overlord warrior decides to take me out, they'll just face a few consequences and move on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shrugged, a hint of determination shining in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like I really need to rely on myself after all. Trusting others is a fool's game! But I still want that Super VIP status. Are there any more items up for auction? Let's keep this going."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne settled back, ready for the next round of bidding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, the auction resumed its usual pace, and this time, they showcased slaves from various other clans. It seemed the world wasn't just about alliances&mdash;there were debts to be settled and vendettas to be avenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some had fallen victim to betrayal, while others were driven to sell themselves into servitude to escape disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the number of slaves from different clans was significantly lower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't interested in any of the other clans' slaves that came up for bidding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Osborne's involvement, the auction regained its normal pace, allowing the various factions in attendance to finally make some gains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he awaited the next item, the auctioneer's voice rang out once more. "Next up, we have a very special female slave on the block. Her background is quite unique&mdash;she's a hybrid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't disclose her specifics or abilities, but I assure you, no matter how much you pay, she will be worth every crystal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished, the crowd erupted into a frenzy of chatter and speculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? All her details are a secret, and you expect us to bid just because she's a female slave? And you seriously think she'll be worth whatever we pay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not buying that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least tell us what two clans she's a hybrid of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auctioneer chuckled in response. "I'm afraid I can't reveal everything due to the sensitive nature of her case. But I can tell you this&mdash;she has half human blood in her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that revelation, a new wave of excitement surged through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One half human blood? And you can't even disclose the other half? It's not some superior clan, is it? Otherwise, why would you keep it under wraps?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Superior clan? What a joke! There's no way a superior bloodline would mix with a lowly one like the Human Community. That would just tarnish their lineage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! It's impossible for there to be a hybrid of the Human Community and a superior clan. With such pathetic details, do you expect us to throw our coins at this auction? You think we're fools?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know I'm out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, intrigued by the murmurs. "A Human Community hybrid with another clan? Half human blood, and no revelation about the other half? What's the deal there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found himself pondering the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But given the Human Community connection, Osborne mulled it over before making a decision; he couldn't let this opportunity slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lifting his paddle, he stated confidently, "I bid one million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a hefty sum for an unknown hybrid slave, even with her Human Community lineage. He figured it would be enough to keep others at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as he settled in, the auctioneer spoke again, cutting through the chatter, "Apologies, but this hybrid girl is under a commission from someone else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The starting bid is 30 million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it doesn't reach that, she will be destroyed on the spot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stunned silence fell over the crowd at the auctioneer's announcement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty million?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was an outrageous starting price, even higher than the opening bids for three top-tier Human Community female slaves who were at the Celestial Deity level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt astronomical, completely off the charts.</span></p></div>
