        <h1>Chapter 1222 Disgraceful</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to watch the Deschanel family's performance unfold before him, his attention split as he kept an eye on the situation within their sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above Hearin City, Joseph stood his ground against three Dark Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This trio consisted of one Superior Deity and two Intermediate Deities. However, Joseph was a Transcendent Deity-level warrior, and perhaps to maintain the Deschanel family's interests, he had emerged from the Sanctuary Casket before fully regaining his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, his power was only at the Superior Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, there was a significant gap even among Superior Deities. Joseph's Divine Body was Level Four, while the three Dark Deities boasted Divine Flames glowing a dull gold, indicating their Divine Bodies were only Level Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference between a Level Four and a Level Two Divine Body was substantial, meaning Joseph's divine power was purer and more robust than theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Monsters! Surrender now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you manipulate the Beast Tide to attack Hearin City? Don't you know this city is under the protection of the Deschanel Clan? You've slaughtered three million innocent citizens&mdash;your sins are unforgivable! Repent at once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph radiated light, shining like the sun in the eyes of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne, it was a sheer waste of divine power, but the effect was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His appearance resembled that of a legendary deity, and his commanding words stirred the crowd into a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's our guardian!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our savior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family is invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Dark Deities roared in response to Joseph's proclamation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher-ranking Dark Deity twisted its form, quickly morphing into a humanoid shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its icy gaze locked onto Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A human god? I didn't expect you to awaken so soon! But do you really think you can stand against us? Today, we will wipe out every last human in this city, and you won't be able to stop us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph scoffed at the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A beast is still a beast, no matter how you dress it up! You think you can destroy this city? You think you can slaughter 30 million innocent people?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't succeed! This city is under my protection! The 30 million souls here are sheltered by the Deschanel Clan! If you dare harm them, I will annihilate you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead meat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury ignited within the Dark Deity. "Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all three Dark Deities launched their attack. Though each of them might not match Joseph in strength, their numbers were overwhelming, and they charged at him without fear, choosing to gang up on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them loomed nearly 10 thousand Class S Dark Exotic Beasts, along with a Beast Tide of millions of beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack! Destroy this city and slaughter every last human!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the three Dark Deities assaulted Joseph, they commanded the Beast Tide to surge forward, which was like a relentless wave crashing toward the heart of the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic gripped the citizens of Hearin City once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Monsters, how dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Deschanel family here, you filthy beasts will never harm a soul in Hearin City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill! Wipe these monsters out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We swear to protect Hearin City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will defend every single citizen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, thousands of warriors burst forth from the direction of the Deschanel Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clad in uniforms emblazoned with the Deschanel family crest, they shouted slogans of unwavering commitment, declaring that they would protect Hearin City and each citizen, even if it cost them their lives, as they rushed headlong into the fray against the Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the millions of ordinary citizens in Hearin City were once again stirred into a frenzy, their hearts swollen with emotion as they watched the brave members of the Deschanel family charging headlong into the Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hidden among the crowd, the Deschanel family members began to shout at the top of their lungs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family is our savior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're our guardians!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Deschanel family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Deschanel family in Hearin City, it's our honor! Rosmandi is lucky to have them! The Deschanel family is a true powerhouse, a family with responsibility!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family should lead all of Rosmandi!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only the Deschanel family can protect us, can safeguard Hearin City, and defend Rosmandi!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Long live the Deschanel family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Joseph clashed fiercely with the three Dark Deities above, down below, Deschanel family warriors engaged in intense combat against the advancing Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ordinary citizens of Hearin City could do nothing but shout themselves hoarse, caught up in a whirlwind of excitement and gratitude for the Deschanel family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Deschanel family's reputation soared to incredible heights!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And soon, as stories of their bravery spread, their standing would rise even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but clap his hands in reluctant admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like I was way too naive! As the head of the Augustine family, I never thought this is how you could gain such prestige."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a wry smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne had no intention of following suit; in his eyes, using the deaths of millions of ordinary people to cultivate a false sense of glory was nothing short of disgraceful.</span></p></div>
