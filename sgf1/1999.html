        <h1>Chapter 1994 Two Straight Losses-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, it was a victory&mdash;though a pyrrhic one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a thousand of the Human Community's Deity Overlord Level geniuses were left standing in the arena. The rest had been wiped out, their bodies scattered on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they had won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One scowled, clearly irritated. "I didn't expect you to win a single match. But it doesn't matter. I got careless. Next time, your Human Community won't win a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deity King Level battle... let's start it right now!" he ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span>'s face remained hard and unreadable, though her thoughts were heavy. Yes, the Human Community had won at the Celestial Deity Level, but the cost had been devastating. And it was true, as Icy One had pointed out&mdash;the Dark Deity Legion hadn't even unleashed their best fighters yet. The ten geniuses from the Upper Races had been few, and there wasn't a single Paramount Supreme Clan genius in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion hadn't even tried to go all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Human Community? They had thrown everything they had into this. Every top fighter they could spare had been sent out, all to make a statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, the outcome left her speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, the battle wasn't over. The competition had been initiated by the Human Community&mdash;it couldn't end with them backing down. To do so would be disastrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they retreated now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the arena battles were over, the Dark Deity Legion would launch a full-scale attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The death toll for the Human Community would skyrocket&mdash;hundreds, maybe thousands, more would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So they had no choice but to keep fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night... where are you? Come back... please. Don't let any more of our people die. Only you can put an end to this war that should never have even begun," </span><span>God of Light</span><span> whispered to herself, but her face remained a mask of stoic determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her hand, signaling the start of the next round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, ten thousand of the Human Community's top Deity King Level fighters flew up to the viewing platform, their presence commanding the attention of everyone in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the Human Community factions, standing beside </span><span>God of Light</span><span>, couldn't hide their growing concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew the gravity of this match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deity King Level fighters were pillars of any major faction. Many of the ten thousand Human Community elites were not just warriors&mdash;they were their families, their nieces and nephews, their children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Human Community lost here...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cost would be too much to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If things are looking hopeless, you can surrender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span>'s voice echoed in the minds of every Human Community fighter on the arena platforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This border competition will last a long time! It's not just about today. Even if we lose today, we can still win in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if you can't win, surrender! Save yourselves. The Human Community will need you for the battles ahead..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hung in the air, and every Human Community fighter on the platforms shuddered involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all turned their eyes to </span><span>God of Light</span><span>, their gazes burning with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one spoke. Instead, they all locked their eyes on the thousand enemies standing across from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight for the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight for glory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle exploded into chaos once more. For these ten thousand Deity King Level fighters, the arena&mdash;which spanned a 300-mile radius&mdash;was beginning to feel cramped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wave after wave of attacks flooded the battlefield, engulfing the entire arena in a storm of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At their level, their vitality was immense, making them harder to kill, but that only made the battle more brutal and blood-soaked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though </span><span>God of Light</span><span> had urged them to save themselves if the fight was too much...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, no one from the Human Community surrendered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fought until the very last man, until the last ounce of strength left their bodies...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one from the Unity Clan surrendered. How could we, the Human Community, surrender?" one fighter shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the final Human Community warrior self-destructed in a fiery explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once again, the Human Community lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All ten thousand of their Deity King Level fighters perished in the arena, leaving only a handful of the enemy standing&mdash;less than ten of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a battle of mutual destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty thousand Deity King Level warriors, and in the end, fewer than ten remained alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An oppressive silence.</span></p></div>
