        <h1>Chapter 2296 Shocked-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Frost Peak City, the entire expanse of the sky was commandeered by gigantic projected screens, broadcasting the state duel live. All it took was a casual glance upwards, and one could immerse themselves in the action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screens were teeming with figures braving perilous terrains in a frenzied quest for something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Folks from every nook and cranny of Zephyr State were transfixed by these images, practically with their noses glued to the screens, desperately scouring for a glimpse of their own sect's disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the onlookers were Danilo and Angela, the Peak Lord of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela pointed out, squinting at the screen. "Look, Bethan and Jamar have camped out at the third layer. Given their skills, they'd be hard-pressed to make it through the fourth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm. If they went charging in there recklessly, they'd probably get kicked out of the competition. Searching for tokens on the third layer? That's a smart play."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo gave a thoughtful nod. "Let's face it, with their current strength, they're not going to snag a high-ranking spot in the state duel. Accepting invitations to join other teams? That's a savvy way to rake in some Sacred Crystals. And just being in the duel is a golden opportunity for them to grow and learn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela let out a long, weary sigh, a tinge of resignation lacing her voice. "The Mystic Sirius Sect? We're just a drop in the bucket in Zephyr State. We're hardly even noticeable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think about it. In all the previous state duels, the best our disciples have ever managed is to fall short of making the top hundred. There were a couple of times they helped others land in the top twenty, but who even remembers that? It's like a drop in the ocean of this competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, I'm really hoping Osborne can throw us a curveball and pull something off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo shot her a look, his face etched with mild shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a skeptical grunt and shook his head. "You're dreaming if you think Osborne can score a decent result. That's asking for the moon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This year's state duel is like a shark tank. The competition is stiffer than ever; it's as if all the top-notch talent decided to show up at once. These super prodigies have popped out of thin air, blowing everyone's minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson, for instance. They've somehow managed to blend three powers at the Supernal Deity King Level. In any other state duel, any one of them would have walked away with the trophy, no questions asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even in the zone duel, with a bit of good fortune, they'd all be shoo-ins for the top ten and make it to the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. But now, they're going to be going at each other like dogs fighting over a bone just to stay in the game. If they really catch a bad break, some of them might not even make it out of the state duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard the same story from other states. There's been a sudden influx of these insanely talented folks, even scarier than the ones here in Zephyr State. In a normal </span><span>year, they'd be guaranteed state </span><span>duel</span><span> champions. Now, they're scrapping for whatever they can get."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo paused for a moment, shaking his head once again. "Osborne's got skills, no doubt about it. But in this cut-throat environment, getting a top spot in the state duel? That's about as likely as pigs flying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's a tough nut to crack," Angela agreed, the glimmer of hope in her eyes fading a smidge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that she doubted Osborne; rather, she was being realistic about the stiff competition he faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logic told her not to set her sights too high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, the heart has its own reasons, and emotions could overrule cold, hard logic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's eyes lit up again, and her voice regained its firmness. "But just think about the Mystic Sirius Sect's tournament and the Tempest Fortress City's city duel. No one gave Osborne a snowball's chance in hell of winning. Everyone said he didn't stand a ghost of a chance! Yet, time and time again, he managed to turn the tables, taking down stronger opponents and walking away with the prize.</span></p></div>
