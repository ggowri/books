        <h1>Chapter 2477 Deal-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne was still far from the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, the pulling force was already astonishing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne was not the least bit flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was merely relying on Sacred Power to resist this pulling force, without even using spatial power or time powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, this was far from his limit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Primordial's voice echoed in his mind. "The Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign is generating such a powerful pulling force nearby because the space and time within it are collapsing! Its internal spacetime structure differs from the outside. Specifically, time flows much slower inside than outside. A day spent within could correspond to a year, or even longer, in the outside world!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, the actual scope of the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign is far more vast than what you see. Under such intense spacetime collapse effects, it naturally exerts a massive pulling force on the outside world, like an elongated black hole."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In fact, the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign is also known as the Space-time Wormhole. Since you possess spatial power and time powers, you can resist this collapse and pulling force more easily than others."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ordinary people might need to reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness to freely enter or exit the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, but you only need to reach Advanced Empyrean Sacredness or even Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection to handle it with ease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's words gave Osborne a deeper understanding of the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Primordial advised Osborne to stay away from the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign and retreat as soon as possible, he also knew that leaving now would be even more dangerous. Only by leveraging the terrifying collapse and pulling force of the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign could Osborne have a chance to contend with Lionel, who had already reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, this is by no means an easy task.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel sneered, "Looks like you still don't want to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne stopped again, Lionel also came to a halt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He worried that pushing too hard might drive Osborne to rush into the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign with the Kingdom Duel Badge. If that happened, all his efforts would be in vain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was unleashing Sacred Power to resist the immense pull from the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, and his condition was clearly much calmer than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He calmly said, "We can have a proper talk. You should understand that with your strength and background, it's impossible for you to keep your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can only survive by handing over the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to me. Otherwise, even if I don't take them, someone else will, and you won't escape in the end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm willing to make a deal with you. As long as you hand over all the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to me, I can offer you ample rewards. I might even give you this Void Sword."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is a supreme Sacred Artifact-level Void Sword! I went through immense hardships to obtain it, and it possesses extremely powerful void-crossing abilities. If it were auctioned, it would be worth at least two to three billion Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you give me your Kingdom Duel Badge, I'll give you the Void Sword. This way, it's not a loss for you and better than dying in the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Lionel's words, Osborne couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, looking somewhat surprised. "You want to trade this Void Sword for my Kingdom Duel Badge?"</span></p></div>
