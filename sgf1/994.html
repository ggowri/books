        <h1>Chapter 994 Assassins Strike</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the forest outside the Lambert family's secluded abode, two figures&mdash;a man and a woman&mdash;stood frozen, their heads bowed in disbelief. Before them lay a lifeless body, trembling violently on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the corpse was missing its head, a gruesome sight as if it had been blasted apart by overwhelming force, they recognized at once that it was their daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple, known as Sin and Crimson, were the second and third-ranked elite assassins of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization. Both held positions in the top fifty of the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings, among the most formidable forces in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, their daughter, Scarlett, lay dead in the forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin and Crimson quaked with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying aura of murderous intent began to swell around them, rising like a tidal wave and engulfing the area for miles. Every creature&mdash;bird and beast&mdash;froze in horror, too frightened to move, while the sounds of insects abruptly vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, nearly a hundred </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins could hardly contain their fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even three Class S assassins among them trembled in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin bellowed, his voice a chilling promise, "I don't care who you are! You killed our daughter, and I will hunt you down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will wipe out your entire family! Every single person related to you will pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will kill you!" Crimson </span><span>echoed,</span><span> her voice laced with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin and Crimson's murderous energy exploded, and in that split second, all living things within a thousand-meter radius&mdash;the birds, the beasts, the insects&mdash;seemed to explode under the sheer weight of their rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin commanded, his voice icy, "Find out who did this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever killed my daughter will pay tenfold, a hundredfold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will chase him to the ends of the world, and I will ensure that everyone connected to him meets the same fate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Class S assassins stepped forward, visibly shaken. "Mr. Kane, Mrs. Kane, according to our intelligence, it was Osborne from the Augustine family who killed the Blood Princess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The princess was leading the mission to surround and eliminate the Lambert family. Everything was going smoothly until, for some unknown reason, all fifty Class AAA assassins hidden near the Lambert family were mysteriously slaughtered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the princess realized something was wrong, she came to check it out. She spotted Osborne in the act and attempted to ambush him after sending a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But then... she never came back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Sin and Crimson froze, their bodies stiffening with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin exclaimed, fury mixing with confusion, "Osborne?! That damned bastard again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there's no way he alone could have taken our daughter down with two Class S assassins protecting her! The Lambert family must have intervened! They teamed up to kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their killing intent intensified, filling the clearing with palpable dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Lambert family is likely heading toward the Augustine Estate now, believing their only chance of escape lies there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the Augustine Estate is still over 300 miles away! They haven't gotten far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Split up and pursue!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who spots the Lambert family as they flee, report back immediately. I want them stopped! You have my permission to wipe out every last one of them! Just leave Osborne to me; I want to make him suffer myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly a hundred Class AAA killers from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, along with three Class S assassins, received their orders and instantly launched into a frenzied pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracking the traces left by the Lambert family as they escaped, those assassins sped along the forest path with an efficiency that outpaced the fleeing convoy's vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, they caught up to the back of the Lambert family's convoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne, who had just finished testing his martial art aura, sensed a multitude of faint spatial fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial fluctuations?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rare as world-class spatial metahumans were, it was unfathomable for so many to mobilize simultaneously. In an instant, Osborne knew&mdash;it was the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forty minutes only! </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's killers are here so soon. I just hope Sin and Crimson aren't among them; otherwise, we're in real trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another thought, Osborne ripped through a dimensional rift and zoomed ahead to intercept the Lambert family's convoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "Attention, everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop the vehicles immediately and prepare for defensive formation! The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> </span><span>Organization's killers are on our tail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pandemonium broke out in the convoy. Greyson and an elderly man swiftly appeared beside </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> their faces etched with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That man was none other than Roy Lambert, the old patriarch of the Lambert family&mdash;a Class S powerhouse no less formidable than Greyson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the situation, Godfather?" Greyson spoke with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With barely an hour on the road and a long distance from their destination at the Augustine Estate, the arrival of </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> assassins meant serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne briefed them rapidly, "With so many of us, we're too slow to outrun them! We'll have to fortify here. I've already called for backup; help will arrive within half an hour. Our mission is clear&mdash;hold the line for half an hour!"</span></p></div>
