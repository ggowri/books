        <h1>Chapter 364 The Wise Order</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, the Alisa Ship made its first port call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After disembarking, Osborne and the others did not return to the ship but instead took a chartered flight back to Pinchide City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These past two days had been uneventful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither the Paltrow family nor the Luther or Walker families had done anything </span><span>against them. The Alisa Ship sailed without incident, free from any further assaults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was well aware that this was the aftermath of the Ghost Ship's demise. Until the dust settled and the truth was uncovered, the Paltrow, Luther, and Walker families would not make any hasty moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From this, it seems they harbor no suspicions towards me. That means there are no moles around me. At least Ryan, Nathan, Yulissa, along with Jacob and Layla, are not traitors within the Augustine family. I had my doubts about Ryan, but it appears I was mistaken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon his return to the Augustine Estate, Osborne pondered deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who among us is the traitor for the Augustine family? If this traitor isn't unmasked, accidents will continue to happen. This traitor must hold a significant yet inconspicuous position within the Augustine family. Who fits the bill?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in thought, he was interrupted by a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Brian sent me to inform you that the Wise Order is convening a meeting and insists on your attendance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa </span><span>entered,</span><span> her cheeks slightly flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted the previous day, she had fallen asleep, only to wake up realizing she had been clutching Osborne's sleeve the entire time. He had let her sleep, staying by her side until she awoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Embarrassed to find she had drooled in her </span><span>sleep,</span><span> she nearly buried her head like an ostrich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, this very incident made her feel closer to Osborne. Although she knew he was not her blood brother, in her heart, she had come to regard him as family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. Lead the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. He had been at the Augustine Estate for some time but had only met Jacob and Layla from The Wise Order. He had yet to encounter the rest of its members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meeting of The Wise Order was likely called because of his intelligence and to discuss the Augustine family's next steps and how to deal with Webster and Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also an opportunity for Osborne to gauge the strength of the Augustine family's Wise Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa swiftly guided Osborne to a central, ancient building within the estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne entered, he found over a dozen individuals waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized only Brian, along with Jacob and Layla.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all offered him a nod of acknowledgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reciprocated with a nod, surveying the room. He knew these individuals were the members of The Wise Order, the actual core of the Augustine family and the most formidable group within it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they stood, the Augustine family would not fall, and no one would dare to underestimate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seated at the head of the room was an older man with a full head of white hair and a beard, sitting upright in a wheelchair, his spirit undiminished. He was the Augustine family's elder statesman, Isaac Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed a presence around him that was subtle yet formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A true master! A genuine Class A master!" Osborne thought with a sense of awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's aura, distinct from the others in The Wise Order, was not strong but overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bowed to Isaac, greeting him and the other elders. "Osborne greets Sir Augustine and all the elders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac offered a faint smile and waved his hand, saying, "Osborne, there's no need for such formality! Everyone here knows who you are. You come highly recommended by that esteemed figure; we are all one family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Truth be told, even with his endorsement, we were initially skeptical of your abilities, doubting that you, so young, could truly resolve the predicament of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we didn't rush to meet you. I must apologize now for our previous underestimation. You've given us a great surprise, destroying the Ghost Ship, finding out who was targeting us, and even bringing back the murderers of Allen, the head of our family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of this, Isaac became a little excited. "On behalf of the Augustine family, I extend our gratitude to you! From this moment forward, should you so desire, you shall be recognized as the true heir to the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he bowed deeply to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members of The Wise Order followed suit, each bowing to Osborne with looks of gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could sense their genuine recognition of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment, then spoke. "Esteemed elders, there's no need for such formality. That's my duty. Let's discuss what we should do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ghost Ship has been destroyed, but the Paltrow, Luther, and Walker families behind it won't let it go. They will still seek opportunities to annihilate the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, the members of The Wise Order all looked solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight them to the end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to annihilate us? We can just spread the news and join forces with the other five ancient families to fight against them together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another one said, "No! Even if we spread the news now, the three families will definitely not admit it. The other five ancient families may not believe it and refuse to join forces with us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we will be exposed; the Paltrow, Walker, and Luther families will know we destroyed the Ghost Ship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac asked, "So what should we do? We can't just do nothing. If we don't join forces with the other five ancient families, we won't be able to stand against them! We will eventually be annihilated!"</span></p></div>
