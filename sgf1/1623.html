        <h1>Chapter 1622 Lethal Intent</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's words only deepened Osborne's rage, leaving him feeling utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Celestara, aside from the West Zone, which was still under the control of the Human Community, the rest of the territory was a harsh reality where oppression and exploitation were the norm&mdash;not just for Diana but for countless others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Diana was in a relatively better position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least her mining skills were impressive, giving her a degree of worth that Emmett and Riley couldn't afford to overlook completely. They were reluctant to make things too difficult for her and even considered her feelings to some extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Other Human Community miners had it far worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many faced cruel fates, sometimes with their lives on the line for a single misstep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet even Diana's plight was intolerable to Osborne. Why should the Human Community, beings born from the cosmos, have to endure such exploitation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celestara was originally their home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The various Dark Deity factions were nothing but invaders, following Lord Malevolence to conquer Celestara. What right did they have to treat the Human Community this way, to look down on them from their lofty positions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, anger flared in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sensing his rising fury, Diana turned to comfort him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, don't dwell on it too much! At least I'm still alive, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, trying to steady himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, have you thought about leaving this place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked taken aback, shaking her head as she bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't leave! My powers are recorded in the Ninth Dark Deity Legion's system. I'm only allowed to operate in this vicinity; if I stray too far, alarms will go off! The entire Ninth Dark Deity Legion would label me a traitor and hunt me down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My life is destined to be here, mining Essence Crystals. There's no chance for me to leave; it's simply impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her last words were laced with a heavy sense of despair, and Osborne saw a deep yearning for freedom in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His heart ached for her situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, if you trust me, I'll make sure to get you out of here! I'll take you away and let you live freely in Celestara. Believe me, I can do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze at his declaration, her eyes wide with disbelief as she tried to comprehend what he was saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Why would he make such a bold promise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when she looked into his eyes, she saw determination and sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For reasons Diana couldn't fully grasp, she found herself wanting to believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! I believe you. I'll wait for that day!" she said, her voice tinged with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It won't be long!" Osborne vowed once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Emmett's booming voice cut through their moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you two doing? Diana, why aren't you mining Essence Crystals? Don't just stand around daydreaming! I'm on the verge of breaking through to Deity Overlord, and I need more Ultimate Essence Crystals. Get to work and dig out as many as you can!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I also need to rise to the 'Brigadier' level soon, which means I have to turn in a ton of Ultimate Essence Crystals&mdash;so make sure to dig up at least a hundred and fifty this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Emmett stalked over, flanked by a few followers, a smug look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glared at Diana, barking orders for her to produce more Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana bit her lip, saying nothing as she activated her earth elemental power to continue mining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her compliance, Emmett smirked, clearly pleased with himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then turned to Osborne, his tone cold and commanding. "You'd better keep an eye on her! She's a leader-of-ten-thousand-level miner&mdash;my right-hand woman. If anything happens to her, you'll be the one held accountable, got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With those condescending words, Emmett strutted away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne scoffed, his voice dripping with disdain. "Emmett, when are you going to learn? What do you think you are&mdash;a commander? You have the nerve to order me around?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you're a miner yourself! Why don't you get your hands dirty and mine the Essence Crystals yourself instead of making Diana do your work? You're not just lazy; you're useless! Do you take some twisted pride in exploiting her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's a miracle you've made it this far, considering what a piece of trash you really are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's derisive words hit their mark, and Emmett's face flushed with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You little punk! What did you just say? You think you can talk to me like that? You lowly Human Community scum! If it weren't for Mr. Riley Raglan holding me back before, you'd already be dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And guess what? Mr. Riley is busy training now, so there's no one to stop me! Apologize right now, or I swear I'll kill you where you stand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A murderous glint filled Emmett's eyes as his threat hung in the air, but Osborne merely smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at Emmett's companions&mdash;a mid-level Deity Overlord and three peak Celestial Deities. Despite the odds, a flicker of lethal intent sparked within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had long wanted to do away with Emmett, but the presence of Riley, a mid-level Deity Overlord, had kept him on edge. He feared engaging could unleash a chain reaction he wouldn't be able to control, leading to a mess he didn't want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, in the depths of the underground, they were at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was only one tunnel back to the surface, and if he could block it, no one would be able to escape.</span></p></div>
