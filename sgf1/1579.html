        <h1>Chapter 1578 Promotion Denied</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After transforming Guy into a Blood Clan member, Osborne thought securing a promotion to chiliarch would be a breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The requirements were straightforward&mdash;achieve the power level of a Celestial Deity and either have a personal third-class merit or three collective third-class merits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne, neither of these obstacles posed a problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While he currently lacked any personal achievements, the warriors under Guy's command were all his Blood Clan descendants. They could easily carry out missions, and any merits gained could be attributed to Osborne. Personal second or first-class contributions might be challenging to attain, but earning a personal third-class merit would be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a well-known tactic among the elites of major factions&mdash;cumulatively building accomplishments through strategic assignments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, within just one day, Osborne earned his first personal third-class merit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy then submitted the recommendation for Osborne's promotion to chiliarch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a leader of ten thousand, so Guy's submissions typically went unchallenged, especially since there was indeed an open chiliarch position in his ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both Osborne and Guy anticipated that the approval process would go smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as often happened, things took an unexpected turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My Lord, there's a problem! Your promotion has been denied!" Guy approached Osborne; his brow furrowed in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne turned, surprised. "Denied? "Why? You're part of the Borden family! How could they reject your proposal for a chiliarch from your own ranks? Did you offend someone up top?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's forced smile revealed his frustration. "It's not me who upset them, my Lord. It's you! More specifically, it's your identity as part of the Human Community that played a role in this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The one who denied my promotion is a general named Herman Saxton! He's at the peak of Deity Overlord strength, and he happens to be my superior's superior. Plus, he's from the Aether Hawks Clan, which is nearly as powerful as our Fero Tiger Clan. The Saxton family is even stronger than the Borden family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy looked apologetic. "I'm so sorry, My Lord! I let you down. I can't argue against Herman's decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's brow creased in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, just because I'm part of the Human Community, Herman gave you no consideration and shut down your promotion outright? Even if the Saxton family is stronger than the Borden family, they wouldn't typically make a move like this without having a solid reason."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sensed that matters were not as straightforward as they seemed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For him, the implications of whether or not he ascended to the rank of chiliarch held less weight; after all, even Guy now followed his orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A promotion to chiliarch would not significantly augment his already substantial covert influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it was the more enduring and overt power that concerned Osborne. He needed to climb the ranks swiftly to command greater authority in the open, earning him broader respect and undeniable clout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even more galling to Osborne was the fact that, simply because he hailed from the Human Community, Herman had vetoed his promotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy continued, "Your identity as a Human is just part of the equation. The bigger issue is that Herman has a son, Donald Saxton, who recently broke through to the Celestial Deity level. His former squad has no chiliarch vacancy, and now Herman wants his son to temporarily transfer to my unit. By doing so, Donald can step into the chiliarch role right here since I have an open spot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Ah, now it makes sense. So, Donald will be joining your team?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right! His transfer order has already been processed, and he'll be reporting to me shortly. Once he arrives, I expect the command for his promotion to chiliarch will follow right on his heels."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's mood grew gloomier at the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Steal my position? Do they really think I'm a pushover? Since Herman had the nerve to send his son here, I don't mind transforming his son into a member of the Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's the one who sent his son to the fire."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, continuing, "Tell me about the Aether Hawks Clan and the Saxton family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy replied, "Yes, sir. The Saxton family is the most powerful family within the Aether Hawks Clan. In Wild Flame City, the Saxton family can easily rank in the top ten, making them a top-tier force, slightly more powerful than our Borden family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Saxton family boasts one Deity King warrior and three peak Deity Overlord warriors. All three peak Deity Overlord warriors hold significant positions in Wild Flame City, two as generals and one as a vice-general.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Saxton family has considerable influence within the Wild Flame Army, arguably more so than some families from the three Upper Races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, the Aether Hawks Clan despises the Human Community, and the Saxton family shares this sentiment. Herman is known for his hostility toward the Human Community, often assigning Human Community warriors to the most dangerous missions in the Wild Flame Army, treating them like cannon fodder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's words only made Osborne's gaze colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Saxton family hates the Human Community and treats them like cannon fodder, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Excellent! When Herman's son arrives, do exactly this..."</span></p></div>
