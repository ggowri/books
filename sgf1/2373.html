        <h1>Chapter 2296 Shocked-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, maybe we should keep a tiny sliver of hope alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo stared at her in disbelief, then let out a wry chuckle and shook his head. "Nah, I still </span><span>ain't</span><span> buying it! With Osborne's current power, he might last a little while on the fifth layer, but there's no way he can stick around there for the long haul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, it's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be next to impossible for him to rack up enough tokens and points. And let's not forget, he doesn't have a kick-ass team to back him up. He'll be left in the dust by the top hundred in the first stage of the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And once that gap starts to widen, trying to catch up in the second stage is like chasing rainbows. It's a total pipe dream!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he talked, Danilo motioned towards the score rankings floating above them. "Take a gander at this. Horace, Broderick, and Benson have already muscled their way into the sixth layer and snagged some emblems. Horace is sitting pretty with a cool 200 thousand points! Broderick and Benson aren't far behind, each with 100 thousand. And players with strong teams, like Conrad, have already sailed past the </span><span>50 thousand-point</span><span> mark...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne going up against them? It's a lost cause, plain and simple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Danilo's face went slack, and a look of sheer disbelief washed over him as he gawked at the projection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the big deal?" Angela asked, all confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She followed Danilo's line of sight up to the screens, and in no time, her face mirrored his shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on a second... Where is Osborne?! Wasn't Osborne on camera just now? I'm pretty sure he was going into the fifth layer along with the others. How the hell did he just disappear into thin air?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo took a deep breath, and his voice suddenly turned serious as a heart attack. "I just saw Osborne go... into the sixth layer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela let out a gasp, completely floored. "What?! Osborne went to the sixth layer? What in the world is he thinking? With his strength, there's no way he can make it there. He'll be a goner in minutes, shredded by those storms!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He couldn't possibly find a token up there in such a short time. </span><span>So</span><span> what's he doing running up there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is crazy! So damn reckless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela sounded a real mix of worried sick and ticked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The sixth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm is way too extreme to keep tabs on properly. The winds are blowing like a son of a gun up there all the time. Any camera equipment we set up gets trashed quicker than you can say 'Jack Robinson'. We've got no clue what's going down up there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worry etched across Angela's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The projections could only display the first five layers of the Arctic Maw Chasm. Osborne had slipped into the sixth layer and simply dropped off the screens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For all they knew, he could be lying cold and dead up there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo frowned and said, "He's out of his mind! I'll bet he got his hackles up seeing Horace, Broderick, and Benson each score 100 thousand points and decided to go for the big bucks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's too hot-headed, that's his problem. He..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo suddenly stopped short. His eyes went as wide as saucers as he gawked at the projections. Danilo looked totally </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span> and even rubbed his eyes, thinking he must be seeing things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a ripple of gasps spread through Frost Peak City like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look! The leaderboard's changing again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the heck is Osborne? He just shot up 100 thousand points and is now tied for second place with Broderick and Benson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a new name on the block. He wasn't in the top twenty, hell, not even in the top fifty, or even the top hundred before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy smokes! He's ranked 108th on the strength leaderboard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Somebody that low-ranked went into the sixth layer? And managed to find an emblem and score 100 thousand points? How the hell did that happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of insane luck is that?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's excited chatter made Angela look back up at the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There it was, plain as day&mdash;Osborne's name, bold and prominent in second place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was left completely </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>.</span></p></div>
