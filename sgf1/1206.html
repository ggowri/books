        <h1>Chapter 1205 Eradicate the Beast Tide</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's excitement was palpable as he mulled over Osborne's plan, finding it highly feasible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we spread the word that anyone who passes our trials and joins the Draco Armed Services Branch will have their immediate family protected by the Augustine family and the Draco Group, we'll attract a ton of talented individuals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this climate of fear and uncertainty, at least a third of Rosmandi's top talents will consider joining us. That's more than enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, simply smiled, his expression calm. "No, that's not enough. I want every single talent in Rosmandi to join the Draco Armed Services Branch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His declaration sent a ripple of shock through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could sense Osborne's ambition and confidence, but how could that be possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Talented individuals were often arrogant and proud; not everyone would willingly submit to being others' subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, not everyone believed that the Augustine family could withstand the Beast Tide or protect their families from the Dark Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke up again, his tone steady, "Grandfather, in the coming days, I plan to lead the Blood Demon members to eliminate all major Beast Tides within Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to ensure that for a while, there will be no more Beast Tides here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's eyes widened in disbelief. "You're aiming to showcase your strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Absolutely! If I want to recruit Rosmandi's talents, they need to see the strength of the Augustine family. They need to know we have the confidence to protect them and their families in these dangerous times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But more importantly, I don't want any more cities in Rosmandi to suffer from Beast Tide attacks. I don't want ordinary citizens to die because of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As the Godfather of Rosmandi, I have to do something for this place! Eliminating all major Beast Tides is my responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I might not be able to control the chaos in other countries for now, but I must take charge of what happens here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His determination was unmistakable, and it left Sebastian and the others in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a world where most were focused solely on survival and where many powerful factions chose to flee with their families during the Beast Tide, Osborne stood out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even some of the superpowers had opted for self-preservation, banding together for safety rather than caring for the common people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here was Osborne, ready to lead the Blood Demon members to eradicate the Beast Tides and restore safety and peace to Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Sebastian sighed, a mix of admiration and concern in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've outdone me. I can't argue with you on this. You've made your decision, and I trust you. You've ascended to a god-like status and are far stronger than I am. I believe you'll act wisely. But even with your newfound power, tackling all the major Beast Tides won't be easy, and there will be dangers. Just promise me one thing... come back safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded earnestly. "Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm not looking to throw my life away. If I encounter a danger I can't handle, I won't act recklessly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian smiled, his expression filled with trust. "In that case, go ahead and set your plan in motion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and said, "Mr. Wesson Augustine, and Matthew, the expansion of Draco Armed Services Branch is now your responsibility. From this moment on, immediately dispatch recruitment orders to all wealthy families, Ancient Families, and even ordinary citizens within Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone, regardless of their background, as long as they possess exceptional talents in powers or martial arts, is eligible to participate in our assessments. Those who pass </span><span>will be entitled to bring their immediate family to Newport City and receive the protection of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the evaluation criteria, you two can decide as you see fit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only requirement is that they must show potential."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson and Matthew nodded promptly. "Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "And get our intel teams moving! We need those satellites scanning every inch of Rosmandi. If any place shows a large gathering of Ferocious Beasts, signifying a potential Beast Tide, I need to know immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the satellites can't cut it, send drones. Engage the populace, too&mdash;if they spot a sizeable number of Ferocious Beasts, they should report it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I'll personally lead the Blood Demons to wipe them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with ferocious resolve as he finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "With 48 hundred Blood Demon members, most of them already top-tier Class S, this is a force that could make even a Dark Deity think twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, it's time for us to take the offensive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's commands rang out, the Augustine family sprang into action, each member galvanized by the urgency of their leader's mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then turned to Bryce. "Mr. Clarkson, I want you to take the helm of Draco Armed Services Branch."</span></p></div>
