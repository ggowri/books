        <h1>Chapter 2629 Toby-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina said, "The Battle Points Monument on the ninth level can exchange for any resources, treasures, Sacred Artifacts, and achievements you can think of! Of course, the premise is that you have enough battle points."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, start redeeming on your own!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"An hour later, the staircase to the tenth level will disappear. We must enter the tenth level before that. So, whatever you want to redeem, make sure to finish within an hour."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina placed her hand on the Battle Points Monument. Instantly, a red glow emanated from the Monument, completely enveloping her, as if forming a cocoon, making her figure invisible to the outside world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone else was astonished but quickly followed Seraphina's example, placing their hands on the Battle Points Monument. In an instant, red light burst forth, enveloping each person and forming individual red cocoons.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone began redeeming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the trials were getting increasingly difficult, and none of them were fully confident they could clear all the way to the eighteenth level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they didn't redeem now and got eliminated midway, their battle points would be wasted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Seraphina was redeeming something at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she was confident in clearing all the way to the eighteenth level, she considered that she could earn more battle points after clearing and still redeem later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, she chose to use these battle points to exchange for items that could enhance her strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While they were redeeming, Osborne and his group of four also arrived nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara asked, "Are they using battle points to redeem something?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Ignore them for now. Let's complete the ninth level's trial first. After we pass, we'll check out what good items we can redeem."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he stepped into the beam of light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina and the others were redeeming battle points, which didn't affect them starting the trial. Osborne easily defeated the warriors' projections of Primary Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For him now, this was too easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even before his breakthrough, he could finish the fight in one breath, let alone now as an advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Clara and Leroy also defeated the warriors' projections in one breath, each earning one million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey, however, took nearly five breaths to defeat the warriors' projections, earning only two hundred thousand battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, the battle points above Osborne, Clara, and Leroy's heads were all 3.3 million, while Casey's was exactly 2 million.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Let's first see what treasures and resources these battle points can be exchanged for."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They also approached the Battle Points Monument, placed their hands on it, and were instantly enveloped in a red glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne found himself in an independent space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was completely empty&mdash;except for a warped shadow that vaguely resembled a tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a deep voice echoed in Osborne's mind. "Challenger, you have 3.3 million battle points. What would you like to exchange from me? You can tell me your needs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at the twisted shadow in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Is this thing actually alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this some kind of peculiar lifeform, or a power projection?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without thinking much, Osborne asked, "What level of weapon can my battle points exchange for?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wanted to first understand the approximate value of over three million battle points to better proceed with the upcoming exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One million battle points can be exchanged for a high-quality Superior Sacred Artifact, and over three million battle points can be exchanged for three artifacts of the same quality," the deep voice sounded again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "One million battle points can only exchange for a decent Superior Sacred Artifact? That's way too low in value!"</span></p></div>
