        <h1>Chapter 2505 Disguising His Cultivation Level</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vice City </span><span>wa</span><span>s huge, and obviously, many people s</span><span>aw</span><span> Osborne, Angela, and Agatha as prey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne felt malicious gazes again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, without any hesitation, he directly drew the Bloodwrought Bow, unleashed the Three-Arrow Volley of Human Arrow, and killed another mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior</span><span>. Just like that,</span><span> all malicious gazes vanish</span><span>ed</span><span> once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, why do I feel like you've gotten stronger?" Angela looked at Osborne curiously. Although he could easily kill mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors before, it  seemed even easier</span><span> </span><span>now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela found it unbelievable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was still just an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, yet his strength was already so terrifying. Could he really continue to enhance his power without breaking </span><span>to the next</span><span> cultivation level? He was incredible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, Angela would never have believed such a person existed. He was simply an anomaly!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, "I did improve a little. But it will be hard to advance further unless I break through</span><span> to</span><span> the cultivation level or encounter some other opportunity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela couldn't help but want to roll her eyes. As an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, he could easily kill mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors, even advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors. And yet Osborne was still unsatisfied? Still wanted to improve? This was just too unfair to others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to Osborne, other prodigies were simply not worth mentioning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Agatha felt a bit speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though she was </span><span>a</span><span> Dark Phoenix, she had to admit that at the same cultivation level, she was </span><span>nowhere near</span><span> Osborne's match. If Osborne wanted to defeat her at the same cultivation level, one move might be enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What a monster!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Osborne made another move, killing someone secretly spying on them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This won't do," Osborne frowned. "There are hardly any normal </span><span>beings</span><span> in Vice City. And our cultivation level is just too low; anyone with a bit of strength will see us as prey."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this rate, no matter how many people we kill, it won't be enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela and Agatha also nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire Vice City </span><span>was</span><span> like a primal jungle&mdash;either you</span><span> were</span><span> strong enough to be the hunter, or you</span><span> would</span><span> just</span><span> be</span><span> prey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they </span><span>were</span><span> not weak, their cultivation level </span><span>wa</span><span>s too low.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone who </span><span>saw</span><span> them </span><span>could not</span><span> help but treat them as prey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was </span><span>trying to come up with</span><span> a solution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, </span><span>he</span><span> could </span><span>use</span><span> the Sublime Concealment Orb</span><span> too </span><span>disguise as someone with a higher cultivation level. However, such a disguise </span><span>wa</span><span>s not perfect and c</span><span>ould</span><span> be easily seen through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the disguise of the Sublime Concealment Orb </span><span>wa</span><span>s not invincible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially for low-cultivation-level warriors trying to disguise as high-cultivation-level ones, they </span><span>we</span><span>re even more likely to be exposed. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However</span><span>, if Osborne disguised his cultivation level as Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection or Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, no one in Vice City would dare to </span><span>approach</span><span> him, and it might even </span><span>make them scared</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne hadn't </span><span>done this</span><span> before. If someone saw through it, they might figure out that he possesse</span><span>d</span><span> the Sublime Concealment Orb, which would cause even more trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, there</span><span> was</span><span> no other choice now. Osborne decided to use the Sublime Concealment Orb to disguise his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Next, I will disguise myself as an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>This might save us a lot of trouble</span><span>. Anyway, we won't stay here for too long. Unless we encounter an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior, most people shouldn't be able to see through my disguise."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela and Agatha exchanged a glance and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela gave a wry smile. "This is the only way. After all, your strength is too overwhelming now. If you don't disguise your cultivation level at all, others won't believe you're just an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King. Instead, they might even suspect you have the Sublime Concealment Orb."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you disguise yourself as an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior, it might </span><span>make more sense</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he found a secluded spot, ensured no one was watching, and immediately used the Sublime Concealment Orb to disguise his cultivation level</span><span>. Soon, he exuded</span><span> a</span><span>the aura of</span><span> an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne believed that ordinary advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors </span><span>would not be able to </span><span>detect his disguise, and even Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors wouldn't notice. However, Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors might sense something amiss, but whether they could </span><span>connect it to</span><span> the Sublime Concealment Orb would depend on their </span><span>experience</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne walked at the front, and </span><span>his</span><span> aura of an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior intimidated many ill-intentioned individuals. In Vice City, advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors were considered the strongest, and </span><span>most </span><span>people wouldn't dare to offend </span><span>one</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There weren't many Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors in the entire Vice City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While</span><span> Osborne could still feel many people watching them, their ill intentions were gone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure enough, </span><span>this works like a charm</span><span>," Osborne was very satisfied. "Should'</span><span>v</span><span>e done this sooner. Would've saved me the trouble of constantly being underestimated."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela smiled and said, "Only you could pull off disguising as an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior. If it were someone else, they'd </span><span>expose themselves</span><span> the moment they made a move. But even if you make a move, no one would doubt you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, your strength has already reached this level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, </span><span>everything went well. </span><span> </span><span>S</span><span>oon</span><span> they</span><span> saw a massive, majestic building in the distance. The structure was incredibly luxurious, enveloped in colorful lights. At the very top hung a plaque with a stage name.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Blossom Cage!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They finally arrived at Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before heading inside, they found a nearby hotel where Angela and Agatha could stay. Once they were settled, Osborne made his way to Blossom Cage alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire Blossom Cage was shrouded in a heavy protective shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne </span><span>activated</span><span> Satan's Eye to </span><span>peer inside.</span><span> </span><span>B</span><span>ut </span><span>to his surprise,</span><span> he couldn't see through the protective shield or glimpse inside Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Interesting, Blossom Cage is indeed extraordinary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If even Satan&rsquo;s Eye can't penetrate this, then there must be at least an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior behind it</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still couldn't take on an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior, as had been proven before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with Flash by his side, they couldn't defeat them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like I can't make a move on Layne in this Blossom Cage unless absolutely necessary. </span><span>First, I need to figure out</span><span> what Layne is up to," Osborne stepped into the Blossom Cage</span><span> with that</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he stepped into the Blossom Cage, two incredibly beautiful women warmly called out to Osborne, "Welcome!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had alluring figures and beautiful faces, rare beauties to behold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And they were merely the receptionists </span><span>here</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but glance at them, and he was instantly shocked</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>T</span><span>hese two beautiful receptionists </span><span>were</span><span> </span><span>at </span><span>mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They have mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors working as receptionists?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression grew more serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a beautifully dressed mature woman approached with a smile and asked, "Sir, is this your first time at Blossom Cage?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed to be a steward of Blossom Cage. Osborne sensed her cultivation level and was instantly surprised again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had just entered Blossom Cage and already encountered an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally understood why no one dared to cause trouble in Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne </span><span>frowned at</span><span> </span><span>the</span><span> strange aura from this woman.</span></p></div>
