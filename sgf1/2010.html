        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light looked at Osborne in silence for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, she spoke with a gentle smile. "It is a pleasure to meet you all. I have heard about your names. To see such promising talents in the Human Community makes me truly happy. And seeing you all in person brings me even more joy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing, her gaze shifted to Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are the one who went by the alias 'Vivienne Hudson,' correct?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's face lit up with excitement as God of Light addressed her directly. Her cheeks flushed, and she replied with enthusiasm. "Yes, God of Light! I did use the name 'Vivienne Hudson' before, but my real name is Anastasia Augustine ."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes sparkled with admiration as she looked at God of Light, an expression that left Osborne feeling exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What is with this overexcited girl? It is just the God of Light. Why are you so thrilled just because she spoke to you? Is it that big of a deal? Why do I not feel excited or awed by her presence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could not grasp Anastasia's reaction and the excitement from Zoe, Mila, and the others. Then again, they could not fathom why Osborne was so calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "It is the God of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She is the Human Community's guardian, one of the strongest warriors in Celestara, and one of the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her legend is etched into the hearts of every human cultivator, making her an idol to countless individuals. Seeing her in person is an event worthy of such excitement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light continued to exchange a few words with Zoe, Mila, Kendra, Diana, Hannah, and even Bryce, asking about their backgrounds. Each of them was visibly thrilled by her attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, her gaze landed on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne," she said, her tone turning serious. "Jethro mentioned that you are here for tomorrow's border competition. Are you planning to participate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew solemn. The time for pleasantries was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is correct," he replied with a nod. "I have heard about the state of the border competition over the past few days. The Human Community is at its most desperate hour. If we keep losing, the morale of our Human Alliance will plummet. At that point, we will not even need the Dark Deity Legion to attack&mdash;some of our own might start defecting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light's expression turned grave. His words struck at the heart of her concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him intently. "Do you have a solution?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled confidently. "Of course! What the Human Community needs right now is victory. A victory in the border competition will reignite the Human Alliance's morale and rekindle their fighting spirit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I need to do is step onto the stage and secure that victory for the Human Community. Then everything will change!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was surprised by his unwavering confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her skepticism quickly surfaced. "I believe in your talent and strength," she said, frowning slightly. "But even if you participate, you will only win one match!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The border competition consists of eight matches every day. Winning just one or two will not change much. In the past two days, we have only won one out of eight matches each day. The Human Alliance's morale has completely crumbled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed softly but quickly composed herself, unwilling to show weakness in front of the younger generation. Her tone turned sharp once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I trust your strength and that of the Seven Young Deity Kings, at best, you will secure a win in the Ascension One Supernal Deity King Level! But that is just one match. It will not alter the overall outcome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne listened quietly, then smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And how many matches would the Human Community need to win tomorrow to turn the tide?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light considered his question carefully. "At least three, preferably four. That would stop the downward spiral and restore some confidence to our Human Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To completely reverse the situation, we must win five matches&mdash;dominating the Unity Clan's Dark Deity Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head as she finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Winning five matches?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even winning two matches seems out of reach with the current disparity in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I even fear a complete defeat tomorrow&mdash;zero wins and eight losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a result would shatter the Human Alliance's morale, possibly leading to mass defections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrival of Osborne and his team has given me a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on the Seven Young Deity Kings' potential and combat prowess, they might win at the Ascension One Supernal Deity King Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that is just one match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One victory cannot stem the tide or restore morale."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three matches at least? Four would be better, and five would be ideal?" Osborne repeated calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at God of Light's worried expression and said, "That is all? I thought you would expect us to win all eight matches. If that were the case, I must admit it is beyond my capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if it is just with five wins, I am confident we can do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sanctum fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light stared at Osborne, blinking in disbelief. She wondered if she had misheard him, but it was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Is Osborne spouting nonsense?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He claims he has the confidence to secure even five victories in tomorrow's border competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could that be possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression darkened as she frowned. She thought, "Osborne is not just confident&mdash;he is arrogant and overestimating himself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you just say?" she asked coldly. "Repeat it. Perhaps I misheard you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone carried a subtle warning. She was giving Osborne a chance to correct himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings, she had high hopes for him. While he seemed prone to exaggeration, she believed he could learn and grow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne remained calm and said, "If your goal is to win five matches tomorrow, I am confident we can make it happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sanctum grew deathly quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light's gaze turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, do you understand what you are saying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is no time for jokes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand perfectly," Osborne replied, unflinching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light's patience wore thin. Her tone turned frosty as she demanded, "Then tell me&mdash;what exactly is your plan to secure five victories in the border competition?"</span></p></div>
