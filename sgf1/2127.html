        <h1>Chapter 2118 Corrosive Marsh Gas!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes darted to a particular direction; he was piecing together the aftermath of the battle that had unfolded hours earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On one side were the exploration teams led by Prince Chuck and Princess Joanna, and on the other, an unknown team or perhaps the creatures lurking within the Corrosive Marsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either way, it was evident that Chuck's and Joanna's team had suffered a defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had left behind a few bodies as they fled into the distance, with their enemies hot on their heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think we should follow and see what's going on!" Osborne declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a debt of gratitude to both Joanna, who had once helped him, and Letitia, who had also lent him a hand. Knowing that they might be in danger, he felt compelled to follow and see if he could lend assistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda glanced at him and nodded. "Alright! You're the boss; I'm with you! Besides, this swamp is massive&mdash;I have no clue which way to go! Might as well follow the trail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their minds set, they quickly pursued the signs of battle, guided by the remnants of the struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne kept his Satan's Eye scanning the marsh as they moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had relaxed a bit since they hadn't encountered any dangers up to this point, but with the knowledge that Joanna's </span><span>team</span><span> was under attack, he sharpened his focus once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there's danger lurking here, it's definitely hiding in the deeper parts of the marsh," Osborne thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The limits of his Satan's Eye meant he could only see about 16 feet into the depths; anything further was a complete mystery. If Umbra Earth creatures lay </span><span>and</span><span> wait below the surface and launched a surprise ambush, most people wouldn't even stand a chance to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of Umbra Earth creatures could be lurking in the Corrosive Marsh? Uriel mentioned it was ten times worse than Death Chasm&mdash;so I can only imagine how vile the creatures here are. We just haven't run into one yet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered this, a sudden movement caught his eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of bubbles began to erupt in the slowly roiling swamp ahead. Normally, bubbles surfacing in a marsh wouldn't raise any alarms, but Osborne's Satan's Eye unexpectedly flared with activity, sending waves of urgency through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a warning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression sobered as he trusted the alert. He immediately halted and grabbed Alfreda's hand, channeling his spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Interdimensional travel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne and Alfreda were propelled backward by several hundred yards, landing on a massive, dark purple lily pad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on the bubbling swamp in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bubbles surged upwards and then burst, releasing a waft of faintly colored smoke. As the smoke encountered the air, it quickly expanded, enveloping a radius of about 328 feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the terrifying reality dawned on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the area consumed by the smoke, everything&mdash;whether it was the floating purple-blue lily pads, rocks, or the decaying vines of the Soulreaver&mdash;melted away as if ice had met a blazing fire. The sizzling sounds filled the air, accompanied by a haze of green smoke rising into the atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Corrosive smoke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Osborne and Alfreda gasped, their faces paling at the sight. A chill crept down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! This stuff can corrode even the rocks from above Umbra Earth! What a terrifying level of corrosive power!" Alfreda gasped, glancing at Osborne with a mix of relief and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a blur when Osborne had whisked her away using interdimensional travel, and she hadn't understood what was happening. The next moment, however, everything in the spot they had just occupied was now shrouded in smoke&mdash;a smoke with a horrifying corrosive ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't reacted quickly and pulled her back, they would have been caught in that deadly cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a corrosive potency, even if they survived, they would undoubtedly suffer severe burns!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's definitely the bubbles coming from deeper within the swamp! Those bubbles contain some terrifying corrosive gas&mdash;let's call it corrosive marsh gas! But the question is, what's causing them? Are they naturally occurring, or is there a fearsome Umbra Earth creature down there, generating this deadly sludge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he fully accepted Uriel's warnings inscribed on the stone tablet&mdash;the Corrosive Marsh was ten times more dangerous than the Death Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for his Satan's Eye, and the early warning it provided about the unusual bubbles, they would have been caught unprepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, his brow furrowing deeply, "Anyone else&mdash;even an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King&mdash;would likely be severely injured or dead if enveloped by this corrosive gas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's no surprise Uriel warned that no one below Ascension Six could survive here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joanna and her team must be in a dire situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's keep moving!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thankfully, there aren't many bubbles around. If we stay cautious, we can dodge them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded, her expression turning serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The confidence and pride she had felt after breaking through to the next cultivation level had evaporated, replaced by the weight of their perilous circumstance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>E</span><span>ven </span><span>a</span><span>n Ascension Six Supernal Deity King couldn't claim safety in this land of Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the newfound knowledge of the danger lurking beneath their feet, they surged ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye allowed him to foresee threats with relative ease, spurring their speed as they followed the faint traces of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne spotted something amid the marsh. "A body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, belonging to the Sylvan Elf Clan&mdash;a member of Chuck's exploration team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, frowning, "He just died less than an hour ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This means we're not far behind them. But I still can't figure out what kind of enemy they faced!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The bodies showed no external injuries, but the organs and bones looked completely shattered. It appeared as if they had suffered some sort of sonic attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That type of attack can pierce through their divine power defenses and directly harm their internal organs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's frown deepened as he processed this revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda chimed in, "At least there's some good news&mdash;the traces of battle are still fresh. This means Chuck and Joanna's team are still alive! The fact they've been running this long without being wiped out means their enemy isn't as terrifying as we thought!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's keep pushing forward! At this pace, we'll catch up in no time, and then we'll finally understand who&mdash;or what&mdash;they're up against!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed determination, he accelerated his pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't shake the growing concern for Joanna; she was only an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, and Letitia was </span><span>at </span><span>the same</span><span> level</span><span>. Yet they had seen several bodies of Ascension Fives along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they still alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching his jaw, Osborne took hold of Alfreda's hand and initiated interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While each leap only covered half a mile to a mile, it was much faster than trudging through the mire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they were getting closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After executing a swift leap, Osborne felt a surge of intense energy surging from ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unmistakably the clash of combat&mdash;just twelve miles away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've caught up!" he exclaimed, urgency flooding his voice.</span></p></div>
