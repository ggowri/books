        <h1>Chapter 1419 Settle Down</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stone house was Lachlan's home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flanking it on either side were similar stone structures, stretching into the distance like a formidable wall, encircling all of Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were a staggering 500 thousand of these houses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every official member of the Wild Flame Army was entitled to one, and the higher their rank, the larger their home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, Albert, Laird, and others had their own stone houses, albeit smaller than Lachlan's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each entrance displayed a plaque detailing the occupant's name, rank, and race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instructed Albert, Laird, and the others to return to their own homes while he led Harry and Amelia to stand before Lachlan's residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door was firmly shut, enveloped in a faint aura of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry exclaimed, eyes wide with surprise, "That's a divine power lock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard people mention them before. They say every citizen's home is protected by a divine power lock, only openable by the owner's divine power! If someone tries to force it, an alarm goes off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Osborne, concern etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How were they going to get inside?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne was merely masquerading as Lachlan; his divine power signature was different. Would he even be able to unlock it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they forced their way in and triggered an alarm, it could raise suspicions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a divine power lock. Let me handle this," Osborne replied with a calm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had learned about the divine power lock from Lachlan's memories. If he was bold enough to impersonate Lachlan, Osborne was confident he could mimic Lachlan's divine power well enough to fool the lock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of the Eclipsing Mantra, his divine power signature matched Lachlan's perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused and channeled a stream of divine power toward the lock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hum, the divine power enveloping the stone house dissipated, revealing an entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped inside with Harry and Amelia, and to their relief, no alarm sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia exchanged astonished glances, their eyes wide with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, your impersonation of Lachlan's divine power is so convincing that it even fooled the divine power lock!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hushed them, signaling for silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shh! We're surrounded by Wild Flame Army members, and the weakest among them is a Superior Deity. Let's keep our voices down to avoid drawing attention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry nodded, his expression turning serious. "Got it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, a grin spreading across his face, "Alright, let's head inside! This will be our new home. On the surface, you'll be my 'servants,' but feel free to treat it like your own place. Just be mindful when outsiders are around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead and pick your rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll find a way to restore your freedom soon, and then you can live as you please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia beamed with joy. "Thank you, Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just be careful. If you sense any danger of exposure, don't hesitate to run. Don't worry about us!" they urged before stepping into the stone house to choose their rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's residence was a far cry from their shabby homes back in Rodriguez Village. It was spacious and beautifully decorated, and most importantly, they wouldn't have to spend endless hours in dangerous mines digging for Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, they could focus on their training instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the Essence Crystals they had stored, while their supply wasn't vast, it was enough to sustain their cultivation for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had seamlessly assumed Lachlan's identity, serving as the captain of his squad. Each month, he received a stipend of two thousand low-grade Essence Crystals, or twenty mid-grade Essence Crystals, from the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These resources, however, were clearly insufficient for the cultivation needs of a Transcendent Deity warrior. Consequently, Lachlan had resorted to other means to acquire more Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This often involved visiting remote villages, fabricating accusations against them, and coercing them into "compensation" with Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Refusal meant death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Lachlan's reputation was so infamous among the Human Community miners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "I can't keep doing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if I change too abruptly, it might raise suspicions. I need a plan that allows me to maintain a semblance of Lachlan's oppressive ways without drawing too much attention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne intended to disguise himself as Lachlan for the long haul, so every move had to be meticulously calculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arousing suspicion could spell disaster, especially considering the overwhelming number of powerful individuals in Wild Flame City. Furthermore, he hadn't fully recovered his own strength, requiring an even more cautious approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First things first. I need to report back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My squad suffered significant losses&mdash;four members died during our mission. While these five weren't from the most powerful upper-caste races, they were far from weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This might put me in a tight spot."</span></p></div>
