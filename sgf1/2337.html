        <h1>Chapter 2277 Why Did You Mislead Osborne-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't be in it. But the Glorious Divine Kingdom has informed me that after the duel, they want me to join a major event. All the leaders of First-rate Powers in the kingdom are required to attend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Glorious Divine Kingdom is up to something big this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's expression hardened in an instant. "The Glorious Divine Kingdom is planning something major? What on earth are they up to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana shook her head. "Don't fret about things that don't concern you. Just focus on your training mission at the Mystic Sirius Sect. By the way, have you found any clues about the alleged slave-trading business of the Mystic Sirius Sect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shook her head again. "Ms. Alba, could the intelligence be off the mark? I've been at the Mystic Sirius Sect for over thirty years, and I've yet to find any proof of their involvement in slave trading."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana furrowed her brows. "Let's hope that's the case. But my source is reliable. If they said it, there's probably some truth to it. The Mystic Sirius Sect might be in the wrong. Keep looking into it, but make sure you don't blow your cover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, Ms. Alba!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana said, "Good. I'm off. If Osborne makes a splash in the state duel and gets the green light for the zone one, let me know. I'll set aside some time to watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Adriana took her leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had made his way back to his quarters. He wasted no time activating the time-acceleration function and went into seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana's words had been like a light bulb going off in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same time, the things she'd said later had piled on the pressure for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were people out there who could merge three, or even four, powers ahead of schedule at the Supernal Deity King Level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was well aware of how tough it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if others could pull it off, Osborne was convinced he could, too. If he couldn't, it just meant he wasn't cutting it and there was still plenty of room to step up his game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Others can merge three or four powers ahead of schedule. Well, then I've got to merge at least four! And since I'm fully merged with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I should be able to handle even more. So, my aim is to merge five powers ahead of time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Or maybe even more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a fierce glint of determination in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">For now, I'll start by merging the third energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne promptly began sizing up his options for the next power to merge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd already combined the dark and spatial powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also had other choices like thunder power, divine power, physical power, soul power, or time power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All in all, there were seven powers on the table!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, these seven were the more potent powers Osborne had under his belt, the ones that were really worth merging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't worry about how strong they were, he also had metal, water, fire, earth, and wind elemental powers, light power, and mind-control power at his disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These powers could also be part of the merging process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had neglected these powers for ages and hadn't put any real effort into cultivating them. Even if he merged them, they wouldn't give him much of an edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once I've merged the powers I've been focusing on, then I'll think about these. Even though the boost won't be huge, at that high-level stage, every little bit of improvement can help me outshine a bunch of opponents. It's all about that extra step forward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and zeroed in on his next merging target&mdash;thunder power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been concentrating on three powers&mdash;dark, spatial, and thunder powers. Since the dark and spatial powers were already merged, adding thunder power next would be a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they all fell into the same elemental power category.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merging divine power, physical power, or soul power would obviously be a lot trickier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And time power, which came from Satan's Eye, was a whole different ballgame compared to dark, spatial, and thunder power. Merging it would also be a real uphill battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alright, thunder power it is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Next, I'll tap into my own understanding and forcefully integrate thunder power into my Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Leroy can pull it off, and Clara can manage it, and most of the top disciples from First-rate Powers can do it, then I, Osborne, sure as hell can too!</span></p></div>
