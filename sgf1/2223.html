        <h1>Chapter 2202 Hunt-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait here for me. I'll be back soon! Kendra, you're coming with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a hundred shimmering figures suddenly appeared behind Osborne, quickly solidifying into reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were Osborne's Spatial Clones!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forged with Sacred Power, these clones were even mightier, their attack power on par with that of the Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings. With a hundred Spatial Clones standing behind Isa and the others, they could keep everything firmly in check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Dark Deity Legion dared to put up a fight, Osborne's clones would unleash a ruthless onslaught, showing them no mercy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'm leaving!" he declared, striding into the Ascending Sacred Sanctum with Kendra beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra, which way did Maddox and the others go?" Osborne asked in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra had a special gift. Once she'd laid eyes on someone, she could imprint their energy signature in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unique ability enabled her to zero-in on their location and the direction they were heading, no matter the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she'd crossed paths with Maddox and his gang before, she knew their energy signatures like the back of her hand and could easily track them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's secret weapon for catching up with Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra closed her eyes briefly and then pointed skyward. "They took to the sky!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Up into the sky? Are Maddox and the others planning to cross the cosmos to reach Racial Convergence Planet? That place is a long way off, isn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd thought they'd slink into deep space, make for Elf City, and use its teleportation array to get back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Elf City had a direct connection to Racial Convergence Planet, and that route was far faster than journeying through the boundless expanse of space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had no cause to doubt Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she said Maddox and the others were up in the sky, then they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne gave the command to the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. "Let's chase after them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum disappeared from the women's view and rocketed upward into the void at a blistering pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, hoping to catch sight of Maddox and his gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, they'd already put some distance between them. Even with the Sacredness Level of his Satan's Eye, he couldn't spot them in the vastness of space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The distance between Celestara Planet and Racial Convergence Planet was enormous. As long as Maddox and the others didn't have a Sacred Artifact, they wouldn't be able to make the return quickly. He had plenty of time to catch up with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Ascending Sacred Sanctum at his disposal, Osborne was definitely faster than Maddox and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Kendra's intuition was right, he'd catch up with them and settle the score.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum pierced through Celestara Planet's atmosphere and plunged into the inky, boundless cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite its breakneck speed, the sheer vastness of space made it seem almost sluggish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it not been for Celestara Planet shrinking rapidly in the rearview, Osborne might not have even noticed the movement of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, they've changed course! Looks like they've caught on that we're hot on their heels!" Kendra said, pointing in another direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a smirk. "Caught on to our pursuit? They've got sharp senses! I hadn't even managed to detect them yet, and they'd already sniffed us out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's too late for them&mdash;there's no escaping now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made a slight adjustment to the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's trajectory and continued the chase with a calm yet determined demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, far ahead in the distance, a colossal war blade sliced through space at an astonishing velocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several figures sat cross-legged atop the blade, their faces etched with grim expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were Maddox and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were seven of them in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, they had come as eight, but Ricky had been killed by Osborne, leaving just the remaining seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pick up the pace!" Maddox gritted his teeth. "I can feel a threat closing in from behind! It's that damn Osborne&mdash;he must have dealt with Zayne and is now chasing us!"</span></p></div>
