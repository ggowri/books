        <h1>Chapter 736 The Final Decision</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent as everyone turned their eyes to Wesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's gaze slowly swept across everyone present. His initially smiling face suddenly turned cold as ice, and for a moment, a chilling pressure settled over the entire room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone felt a shiver run down their spines, a deep sense of dread creeping into their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson let out a contemptuous snort, and many members of the Augustine family immediately slumped to the ground, their faces drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at Wesson, confused as to why he was suddenly so angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson spoke coldly. "Have you all gotten too comfortable? Have you forgotten how you've come to live the way you do now? Have you forgotten who calls the shots in the Augustine family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I not make myself clear?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am merely conveying Godfather's order. In one month, the Augustine family will host an Honor Quest Ceremony for Osborne, the champion of the heir selection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did any of you think Godfather was negotiating with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Wesson spoke, the elders of the Augustine family turned pale, beads of cold sweat dripping down their foreheads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had been adamantly opposed before now looked utterly terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson snorted again, "I have relayed Godfather's order clearly. Your job is to fully prepare for the Honor Quest Ceremony! It has nothing to do with you guys that whether Osborne is qualified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think your judgment is better than Godfather's? Do you believe your decisions are more sound than his?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone thinks so, step forward and tell me. I will relay it to Godfather and suggest he hand over the head of the Augustine family to them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's gaze swept across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone immediately lowered their heads, not daring to meet his eyes, let alone speak up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Wesson ease his anger a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, this is Godfather's decision! Every member of the Augustine family must ensure the Honor Quest Ceremony proceeds smoothly. Whether Osborne's Honor Quest Ceremony turns into a disgrace in a month doesn't matter; it must go on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, does anyone still oppose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's gaze swept over the crowd once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, no one dared to object. They all nodded in agreement, promising to follow Godfather's orders and properly prepare for Osborne's Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile returned to Wesson's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well! Then it's settled. All of you should head back to Newport City to begin preparations for the Honor Quest Ceremony! Over the next month, I don't want to see anyone holding Osborne back. Anyone who does will face punishment under family law!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's threatening words sent a wave of fear through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gazes towards Osborne became more complicated. Wesson's words meant that for the next month, the entire Augustine family would revolve around Osborne's Honor Quest Ceremony. No one would dare provoke Osborne anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if Wesson decided to hold them accountable, no one could bear the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, the resources of the Augustine family would also be fully open to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson then turned his gaze to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "Osborne, tell me, are you confident? In the history of the Augustine family, there have been six Honor Quest Ceremonies, but only two people have ever achieved fifty consecutive victories, and no one has ever reached a hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Godfather only managed ninety-five wins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have the confidence to host a truly glorious Honor Quest Ceremony for the Augustine family? To achieve at least a hundred consecutive victories?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's words left everyone in the Augustine family stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought it was pure fantasy to expect Osborne to surpass Godfather and achieve a hundred wins!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, they just hoped Osborne could at least achieve ten consecutive wins during the Honor Quest Ceremony and not turn it into a disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They dared not even dream of Osborne reaching fifty consecutive wins, let alone a hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family began whispering among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson ignored them, continuing to smile as he looked intently at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, feeling a bit helpless, replied honestly, "I don't have a shred of confidence! But I will do my best. If someone else can do it, why can't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson was momentarily taken aback, then laughed and said, "You're right. If someone else can do it, why can't you? I'll be waiting to see your performance. If you can't even achieve fifty wins, then find a remote place and go into seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't bring shame to Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Wesson waved his hand, and a beam of light shot toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne caught the light and saw that it was a new emblem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Premier Heir Emblem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson handed an Heir Emblem to Emma and subsequently gave another to Matthew before finally turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In a month, I will personally go to the Augustine Estate in Newport City to preside over the Honor Quest Ceremony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't disappoint me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Wesson's figure disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd finally breathed a sigh of relief, then turned their gaze to Osborne. Every face was filled with seriousness and worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we really going to hold an Honor Quest Ceremony for Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't a joke, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This will definitely turn into a disgraceful ceremony!"</span></p></div>
