        <h1>Chapter 1962 Standing Proud on the Ascension Stairway</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fusion of Divine Flame and Divine Body was the crucial key to breaking through from the highest Deity King Level to become a Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, however, it was the merging of the Infinite Sacred Flame with the Infinite Sacred Body. No one had ever achieved such a feat while still on the brink of becoming a Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, even after breaking through, those who possessed the Infinite Sacred Body were exceedingly rare. At least, no such being had ever appeared in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of Osborne's breakthrough was nothing short of cataclysmic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire expanse of deep space trembled as chaotic spatial currents drew near, only to be shredded apart by the sheer ferocity of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blazing Infinite Sacred Flame enveloped Osborne, each flicker of flame penetrating his body, seeping into every single cell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, a more terrifying energy erupted violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's veins bulged, and the searing pain forced a primal roar from his lips, his face contorting into a mask of agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt every cell in his body being scorched, burning within the Infinite Sacred Flame, undergoing a transformation toward a higher state. It was as if his consciousness detached from his physical form, merging with the world around him, allowing him to feel the energies of the universe like obedient little sprites ready to heed his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fundamental difference between a Supernal Deity King and an ordinary Deity King lay in their mastery of the world's energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a deeper, more comprehensive understanding that allowed for effortless manipulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a whole new level, akin to how a primitive man learned to wield fire and operate heavy machinery, igniting an industrial revolution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne's Infinite Sacred Flame and Infinite Sacred Body fused, it wasn't just about the Infinite Sacred Body becoming stronger. He established a more profound connection with the world around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very fabric of the universe seemed to become his ally, ready to rally to his call whenever he needed its strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fusion of the Infinite Sacred Flame and Infinite Sacred Body continued for two full days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the last flicker of the Infinite Sacred Flame completely melded into the Infinite Sacred Body. At that moment, Osborne's form shimmered with an otherworldly glow, every angle and contour resembling a masterpiece crafted by the creator, radiating both beauty and explosive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his physical strength surge tenfold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, he had already achieved Single Dragon Might, but now he was at least at Denary Dragon Might!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that I have Denary Dragon Might, I can finally hold my own against the newly awakened Sacred Dragon Clan," Osborne chuckled to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Dragon Clan was one of the most powerful high-tier races in this cosmic expanse, born with Single Dragon Might, capable of annihilating most peak warriors with a mere glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the Sacred Dragon Clan, the Human Community seemed weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that didn't mean the Human Community would fall short once they matured. The top warriors among them were no less formidable than fully grown Sacred Dragons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Becoming a Supernal Deity King is just the beginning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that my Infinite Sacred Body and Infinite Sacred Flame have fully merged, it's time to ascend the Ascension Stairway and stand firm upon it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered this, he looked around, confusion etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is the Ascension Stairway?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the thought crossed his mind, the world around him shook violently, and a massive staircase suddenly descended from the heavens, landing right before Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ascension Stairway! It's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was overwhelmed with excitement, his heart racing at the sight before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed at the Ascension Stairway, a grand staircase that seemed to descend from the heavens without a visible endpoint. Its sheer magnificence resembled a celestial ladder, promising that those who climbed it would ascend to higher realms of existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne could only glimpse a small portion of this monumental structure, just seeing one step made him feel insignificantly small.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Ascension Stairway! As long as I step onto it and endure its trials, standing firm along the way, I'll become a Supernal Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He inhaled deeply, confidence radiating from his every pore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't yet know what challenges awaited him atop the Ascension Stairway, but exuberance filled him. He was convinced that no trial could shake him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't remain steady here, who could? Nobody!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this realm, I am invincible! Others? They're merely stepping stones!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that indomitable spirit fueling him, Osborne wasted no time and stepped onto the first rung of the Ascension Stairway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Ascension Stairway quaked violently, as if it had come to life, roaring like a mighty dragon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a rush of force, as if the very staircase aimed to throw him off balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, an enormous repelling force surged against him, attempting to launch him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed, saying, "You think you can shake me off? Dream on! If I am deemed unworthy to tread this path, then who is worthy? I have every right to stand on this Ascension Stairway! Stay still!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He punctuated his command with a thunderous stomp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of terrifying power erupted on the Ascension Stairway, rippling through the structure until it became silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The repelling force evaporated in an instant, leaving Osborne firmly planted on the steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A confident smile crept onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, it looks like you know your place! So, does this mean I've passed the test and am officially a Supernal Deity King now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he contemplated this, a sudden frown crossed his brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed a massive wave of soul power hurtling toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "A soul attack? Is this part of the Ascension Stairway's challenge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such an attack might work on others. But against me? That's just laughable! Be gone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce bellow, Osborne shattered the incoming soul attack before it even grazed his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His soul power vastly exceeded this level of assault!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on! What other trials do you have for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood with his arms crossed, his gaze proudly fixed on the end of Ascension Stairway, which seemed swallowed by the void, his eyes glinting with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps his defiance stirred the Ascension Stairway to anger, as it trembled once more, and a barrage of attacks rained down upon him, completely enveloping Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each assault was on par with a full-force strike from an Ascension One Supernal Deity King. For anyone else attempting to stabilize themselves on the Ascension Stairway during such an attack, it would indeed be a pipe dream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet for Osborne, these strikes were practically nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't be bothered to defend himself against them, allowing the blows to crash against his Infinite Sacred Body. With the Infinite Sacred Flame enhancing his form, his body had become far more resilient. Not even the strongest of those attacks could tear through his skin, let alone harm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, it was as if Osborne had transformed into a battle god, standing tall and proud upon the Ascension Stairway. He remained unyielding against the wrath of the staircase, unwavering in the face of its onslaught!</span></p></div>
