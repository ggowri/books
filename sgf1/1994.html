        <h1>Chapter 1992 A Battle to the Death-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, are you kidding me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was in shock, barely able to process what he was hearing. "The Hudson family submitted a list with ten thousand of the highest Deity King level geniuses? Ten thousand! Are you sure that's right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even we, at HeartUnited Alliance, only have just over ten thousand of those top-tier Deity Kings. Mr. Jackson, I'd imagine your family's numbers are pretty close, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten thousand Deity Kings at the highest level... from the Hudson family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And on top of that, the Hudson family is supposed to have a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings? How is that even possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A hundred Supernal Deity Kings?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did Supernal Deity Kings start being so common? I can't believe it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian finished speaking, and the others couldn't help but nod in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had voiced what was on everyone's mind. They all knew the Hudson family well, and as far as they were concerned, the Hudsons ranked near the bottom of the Dukedom-level power structure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their intelligence...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family had only a little over a thousand of the highest Deity Kings. Even at their peak, they only had two or three thousand at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Supernal Deity Kings? They were practically nonexistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, the few Supernal Deity Kings they had were mostly dead by now. Wasn't Jethro the only one left?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So where on earth did these hundred Supernal Deity Kings come from?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned their eyes toward Jethro, then to </span><span>God of Light</span><span>, waiting for an explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span> spoke calmly, "So, as I said, I was pretty shocked by the list Mr. Hudson submitted. The reason I didn't include anyone from the Hudson family on today's roster is because their list was too perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hudson suggested that, if possible, we should have these individuals from his family compete in the border competition. They work so well together, they've got perfect chemistry... if they fight as a team, they could showcase even more power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I haven't seen them in action yet, so I wasn't willing to risk putting them on the line. That's why I didn't arrange for any Hudson family members to compete today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I've verified the strength of the people on their list, though, the Hudson family will definitely enter the competition. And most likely, they'll sweep the Deity Overlord Level, the Deity King Level, and the Ascension One Supernal Deity King categories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, is there anyone who still has doubts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After </span><span>God of Light</span><span> finished speaking, the room was filled with stunned silence. Everyone collectively gasped, utterly shaken by the revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro... was going to let the Hudson family sweep all three of the major competitions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten thousand top-tier Deity Overlords...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten thousand of the highest Deity Kings...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't that the perfect lineup to dominate those three categories?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How was this even possible?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the top three powerhouses&mdash;Jackson family, HeartUnited Alliance&mdash;had never dreamed of sweeping a single competition, let alone all three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, the Hudson family&mdash;whom they'd all looked down on&mdash;was about to claim them all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone, at this moment, was completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian furrowed his brow. "How could the Hudson family possibly be this strong? With this kind of power, they could easily be ranked among the top five Dukedom-level powers in the entire Human Community, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Jethro. "Jethro, aren't you going to explain yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro sneered. "Julian, don't you think you're going too far? Why should I explain anything to you? </span><span>God of Light</span><span> didn't ask me to explain, so who do you think you are, demanding answers from me?</span></p></div>
