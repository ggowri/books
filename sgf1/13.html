        <h1>Chapter 13 Don’t You Want to Have Me?</h1>
        <div><p>Isa replied indifferently, “Just call me Isa. As for the Alpha Elixir, the Godfather has already prepared it for you.”</p><p>After saying this, Isa handed Osborne a vial of the potion.</p><p>Osborne looked at the potion, his eyes gleaming, and without hesitation, he drank it.</p><p>Instantly, he felt his left eye begin to pulse wildly.</p><p>The world before him became clearer and seemed to move slower.</p><p>A second silver star spot appeared in his eye.</p><p>At the same time, Isa’s red and black riding suit began to become transparent in Osborne’s view.</p><p>A stunningly perfect figure appeared before his eyes.</p><p>Osborne was completely dumbfounded, his eyes glued to Isa’s body, unable to look away.</p><p>X-ray vision…</p><p>His Satan’s Eye had indeed reached level two. Now, he truly possessed the ability to see through objects.</p><p>Isa’s riding suit could no longer conceal her beautiful figure…lush and curvy, with ample breasts.</p><p>She was simply voluptuous…and unexpectedly hairless between her legs.</p><p>Osborne swallowed hard, glancing up and down at Isa, feeling parched and unwilling to look away.</p><p>Fortunately, the X-ray ability of Satan’s Eye was absolutely confidential. Isa did not know, or she might have become furiously embarrassed and gouged out Osborne’s eyes.</p><p>“What are you looking at?”</p><p>Although unaware of Osborne’s X-ray vision, Isa still felt uncomfortable under his intense gaze, as if he wanted to devour her.</p><p>Osborne snapped back to reality and stopped using his X-ray vision.</p><p>He was slightly embarrassed and quickly said, “Nothing, just… You look very beautiful, and your figure is perfect.”</p><p>Isa smirked proudly. “At least you have good taste. How about it, want to swap your reward for me? Give me a hundred million dollars in cash, and you can do whatever you want with me.”</p><p>Osborne coughed, looking away from Isa.</p><p>Isa was indeed beautiful and tempting, but between a hundred million dollars and Isa, he still chose the money.</p><p>With a hundred million dollars, why not find countless beautiful women?</p><p>“Humph! Silly boy, you’ll regret it. Now, you don’t want to trade me for a hundred million dollars, but later, even a hundred billion dollars won’t get you a chance.”</p><p>Isa continued, “Also, the Draco Star Wristlet integrates a store where you can buy some things you need. The higher your access level, the more you can purchase.”</p><p>Osborne quickly got back to exploring and soon found the store.</p><p>The store was filled with dazzling items, including luxury cars, designer watches, as well as advanced handguns, automatic rifles, even large-caliber sniper rifles, and high-powered explosives.</p><p>Osborne was astonished.</p><p>If he had the Draco Star Wristlet earlier, why would he have needed to use fake explosives to intimidate the Caldwell family?</p><p>He could have just ordered real explosives here.</p><p>Now, however, he no longer needed explosives. What he did need was a good handgun.</p><p>He quickly took a liking to a Draco Model H mini-handgun.</p><p>This was a special handgun that claimed to have the fastest bullet speed, three times faster than a normal handgun, making the bullets nearly impossible to dodge.</p><p>It used special bullets, one-tenth the size of regular bullets, lethal only if they precisely hit the head or heart, and a magazine could hold a hundred rounds.</p><p>The price was three hundred thousand dollars.</p><p>Osborne’s face lit up with excitement. He knew this type of handgun because of its unique design and performance, plus its limited production was collected by many important figures.</p><p>On the black market, such a handgun could cost millions of dollars, even tens of millions of dollars.</p><p>But it was only three hundred thousand dollars in the Draco Star Wristlet’s store.</p><p>Without hesitation, Osborne ordered two handguns and several tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition.</p><p>The total cost was one million dollars.</p><p>After the purchases, Osborne’s account still had one hundred and nineteen million dollars left.</p><p>He was satisfied.</p><p>Only then did he turn his attention to another subfolder in the Draco Star Wristlet.</p><p>This folder was named The Breath of Celestial.</p><p>The Breath of Celestial was a form of Glacium martial arts, a special breathing technique that, if mastered, could rapidly enhance physical fitness, far more than lifting weights in a gym, and could even break human physical limits.</p><p>Its value was immeasurable.</p><p>“You’d better not have too many expectations for The Breath of Celestial.”</p><p>However, Isa spoke up at that moment.</p><p>“In today’s world, Equitaria martial arts are dominant, while Glacium martial arts have declined, primarily because Glacium martial arts are too weak in the early stages, even considered superficial, and not as straightforward and practical as Equitaria martial arts. Moreover, Glacium martial arts are difficult to master, requiring a high level of innate talent.”</p><p>Osborne nodded, not paying much attention. He felt his martial arts talent was pretty good, and since The Breath of Celestial was a reward from the Godfather, he naturally wanted to give it a try.</p><p>“Alright, we’ve wasted enough time. Let’s get on the motorcycle.”</p><p>Isa suddenly straddled the motorcycle, leaned forward, displayed her impressive figure, and signaled Osborne to hurry up and sit behind her.</p><p>Osborne asked, puzzled, “Where are we going?”</p></div>
