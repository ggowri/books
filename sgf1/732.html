        <h1>Chapter 732 Honor Quest Ceremony</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Wesson finished speaking, everyone, except Osborne, who looked utterly confused, had expressions of shock as if they couldn't believe what they had just heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Emma was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Honor Quest Ceremony for Osborne in one month? How is that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could Godfather have made a mistake?" Emma muttered under her breath, and her brows furrowed in concern as she glanced at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others were even more shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather wants to hold an Honor Quest Ceremony for Osborne? This is outrageous! We can't let this happen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne isn't qualified!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne doesn't have the strength to support an Honor Quest Ceremony! At his current level, if we go through with this, the Augustine family will become a laughingstock across the globe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, absolutely not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is only at Class AA; how could he possibly hold an Honor Quest Ceremony? Even if he were at Class AAA, it still wouldn't be enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This will end in disaster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone discussed heatedly, their expressions extremely serious, even somewhat panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was quite surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know what the Honor Quest Ceremony was, nor did he understand why every member of the Augustine family reacted with such shock upon hearing that Godfather intended to host one for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, it seemed as if the entire Augustine family was against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to ask Emma for clarification, but before he could speak, Emma urgently said, "Osborne, you absolutely must not agree to hold the Honor Quest Ceremony! This won't be good for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and was about to ask why when he suddenly felt the Draco Star Wristlet move slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew it meant his Seventh Inheritance Trial had arrived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly glanced at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Seventh Inheritance Trial. Now, you must shoulder the responsibility of the Augustine family, hold your own Honor Quest Ceremony, and become the first heir in the history of the Augustine family to successfully complete an Honor Quest Ceremony. You must fight until no one dares to challenge you, accomplishing what even I have never done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Godfather's Seventh Inheritance Trial is for me to hold my own Honor Quest Ceremony and become the first in the Augustine family's history to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Godfather never accomplished this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has Godfather failed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather wants me to fight until no one dares to challenge me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression became serious. Although he still wasn't clear on the specifics of the Honor Quest Ceremony, he already knew it was no simple task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Godfather wouldn't have failed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne actually didn't know just how powerful Godfather was. But Godfather had founded the Draco Group, defeated the Aberrants, and become the king of the Rosmandi underworld. Osborne wasn't confident he could achieve any one of these feats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather was undeniably a legend of Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet such a powerful man had failed in his own Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't confident he could succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression grew even more solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, did you hear me? Remember, you must refuse. If you refuse to hold the Honor Quest Ceremony, no one will force you! No one will look down on you; everyone will just think you're smart," Emma said anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and replied calmly, "No! I will hold my Honor Quest Ceremony! This is Godfather's wish, and I won't let him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was stunned by his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "But you still haven't told me, what exactly is the Honor Quest Ceremony? Why is everyone so agitated about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma took a deep breath to calm herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Biting her lip, she said, "So, you don't know what the Honor Quest Ceremony is. Alright, I'll explain it to you now. I believe that once you understand what it is, you'll give up on the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Honor Quest Ceremony was initially proposed by Marcelin's Thornberry family. The Thornberry family is the most powerful Divine Family in Marcelin and one of the strongest Divine Families in the world. They are far stronger than the Rosenthal family of Yalynch and much stronger than our Augustine family as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Thornberry family once had an unbelievably powerful individual named Helios Thornberry, who shared his name with the Sun God. His strength was universally acknowledged, and he held the number-one spot on the global Quasi-Divine Rankings for a long time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some even say he is still alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over two hundred years ago, he was appointed as the heir of the Thornberry family. He requested an Honor Quest Ceremony, inviting all the young geniuses and experts from around the world to participate in his ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During his Honor Quest Ceremony, young talents from across the globe could challenge him. He wouldn't refuse anyone's challenge, and anyone who could defeat him would receive a massive reward of 500 billion dollars and be allowed to choose any one of the Thornberry family's divine artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that Honor Quest Ceremony, Helios Thornberry faced a total of 170 challenges from young talents around the world. He defeated them all. In the end, no one dared challenge him anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After that, he became a Class S Supreme Overlord and rose to the top of the global Quasi-Divine Rankings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From then on, he became truly the strongest in the world!"</span></p></div>
