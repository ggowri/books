        <h1>Chapter 1412 Take Down Lachlan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne commanded, "Rise up! Here's what I want you to do next..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert and Laird exchanged a glance, both nodding in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they executed Osborne's orders without hesitation or question&mdash;after all, in their minds, Osborne had ascended to the status of their utmost deity, the one who held sway over their every fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swiftly absorbed the surrounding blood energy, capturing the memories of the two fallen comrades and weaving them into a mental palace deep within his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he melded into the very rock itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the concealment of the Eclipsing Mantra, his presence blended seamlessly with the stone. Even if someone brushed past him, they wouldn't sense so much as a ripple of his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne readied himself for another ambush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, his target was the Transcendent Deity team leader&mdash;Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defeating Lachlan wouldn't be a walk in the park given Osborne's current strength, but with Albert and Laird's support, coupled with his stealthy strike, he was confident he stood a decent chance of taking Lachlan down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he decided to go for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lay in wait within the rock, anticipation coursing through him as he awaited Lachlan's arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes later, Lachlan finally broke through the collapsed rock, re-establishing the mine's passageway that had caved in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had sensed the chaos of the earlier battle almost immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rushing forward, he was met with the sight of the battered Albert and Laird, as well as the bodies of their fallen comrades sprawled on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned gloomy, a storm brewing within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dead were his teammates! To lose two members while handling a few rebellious miners was a bitter blow. Heartache washed over him. Lachlan sensed punishment looming for this failure upon returning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Albert! What in blazes happened here? Who attacked you? Was it Harry and Amelia? No way&mdash;they're hardly a match for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert, visibly injured, struggled to get the words out. "Mr. Swift, it was the Deathborn! We faced three Superior Deity Deathborns. We barely managed to injure them enough to drive them off, but we... we lost two of our own in the process..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's brow furrowed deeply. "Three Superior Deity Deathborns?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What rotten luck! Those things are a rarity in these mines. How did you run into three at once?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed under his breath, frustration boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a nightmare! If you two had been lost, our team would have taken a serious hit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stepped closer to the two men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are you both holding up? Are your injuries serious? Let me take a look..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in that instant, the seemingly wounded Albert and Laird exploded into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their divine power surged, slamming into Lachlan's chest with unrestrained ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan completely underestimated them; after all, these two men, despite often belittling his human heritage, had always shown him respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never had he imagined they would turn on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, Lachlan, even as a Transcendent Deity vastly stronger than them, found himself reeling. The blow sent him staggering back, blood exploding from his mouth as he crashed against the rocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert and Laird knew they wouldn't take down Lachlan in a single hit, even with the advantage of surprise. They charged at him again, relentless in their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You traitors! Stop them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan roared, fury evident in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five others standing nearby were caught off guard, equally stunned that Albert and Laird would turn on their own leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until they heard Lachlan's furious command that they snapped back to reality, but instead of rushing to his aid, they hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's anger boiled over at their inaction. "What are you standing around for? Get in there!" he bellowed, his frustration palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Albert seized the moment, his voice rising above the chaos. "Guys! Here's our chance! Let's take down this pathetic human! He doesn't deserve to lead us. If we can get rid of him and pin the blame on the Deathborn, we all have a shot at stepping up! Let's take him out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's eyes widened in horror as the realization hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Those Dark Deities&mdash;they're in cahoots! They must have been scheming against me all along!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear clawed at him as he processed this betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the five hadn't yet acted, he could feel the tide shifting against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With both Albert and Laird bearing down on him, Lachlan found himself struggling to mount a defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a shadow loomed behind him, hidden amidst the jagged rocks&mdash;a figure emerged, gripping a wickedly sharp scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grin spread across Osborne's face. Everything was playing out even better than he'd anticipated. As he observed the disheveled Lachlan, he felt over eighty percent sure he could finish him off now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at you, a human cultivator aligning yourself with the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, serving Lord Malevolence while exploiting and humiliating your fellow humans! You've sealed your fate!" Osborne mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a flash, he lunged forward, swinging the Goddess of Grain's scythe towards Lachlan's neck without a sound.</span></p></div>
