        <h1>Chapter 2479 Take the Void Sword-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder who had been speaking with Osborne earlier now coldly said to Lionel, "We don't care who you are, whether you're Lionel or someone else. Hand over the Kingdom Duel Badge immediately! That</span><span>'</span><span>s not something you can keep for yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We</span><span>'</span><span>ve chased Osborne for so long with so many people. There</span><span>'</span><span>s no way his Kingdom Duel Badge will be yours alone. Hand it over obediently, and we can let you take a bigger share."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, don't even think about leaving today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is also a warrior of Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, among the dozen or so people present, there was another warrior of Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, while the rest were at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. Osborne, relying on Satan's Eye, noticed that all of them were disguised, with none revealing their true faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, silently memorizing their true appearances, planning to take revenge once he had the strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his gaze turned to Lionel, wanting to see how he would respond.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could Lionel be intimidated by these people? If he really takes out the Kingdom Duel Badge and shares it with them, that would be trouble," Osborne </span><span>said</span><span> to himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, his worries were clearly unnecessary. Lionel would never easily hand over something already in his possession. Even when facing two warriors of Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection at his level and over a dozen warriors of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, he would never back down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, if the more than 46 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were divided among nearly twenty people, even if he got a larger share, it would only amount to around 500,000. That wouldn't even be enough to buy a single supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To obtain the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, he went as far as burning his blood essence to chase Osborne, barely managing to stop him, erase the imprint on the Void Sword to gain trust, and secure his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. There was no way he would just give it up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel sneered and replied, "Ridiculous! The Kingdom Duel Badge is something I obtained on my own. Why should I share it with you? If you want it, come and take it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he unleashed his full power instantly, swiftly charging toward Osborne, aiming to reclaim his Void Sword and make a quick escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His idea was good, but hard to achieve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man reacted swiftly, or rather, he had already anticipated Lionel's refusal and prepared in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Lionel move, he immediately took action. "Stay with us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying force erupted from the old man, instantly engulfing Lionel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel, though angry, was unafraid and unleashed a powerful force to resist. Unfortunately, he was alone, while the opponents trying to stop him numbered over a dozen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a dozen attacks struck simultaneously, each immensely powerful, leaving Lionel no room for carelessness as he frantically dodged and counterattacked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An intense battle unfolded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne became a bystander in the chaos. Having lost the Kingdom Duel Badge, he was no longer seen as a threat, and no one would bother wasting effort on him anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's lips curved slightly, revealing a faint smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The fiercer you fight, the better. This way, no one will notice me, and I can slip away smoothly!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he did not leave immediately but kept his eyes fixed on the Void Sword nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel tampered with the Void Sword. It c</span><span>ould</span><span>n't be stored in Dimensional Space or Satan Space, and even touching it with bare hands cause</span><span>d</span><span> injury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I want to take this Void Sword, it seems a bit tricky.</span></p></div>
