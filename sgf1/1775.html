        <h1>Chapter 1774 Eager</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow declared with a smug grin and her pride evident, "Osborne is going to be my grandson too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Osborne is just incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian chuckled, nodding in agreement as he gazed fondly at Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa! Grandma Divine Shadow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne and the others appeared at their side, grinning at the sight of their intertwined hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment made Divine Shadow blush, and she quickly let go of Sebastian's hand, prompting even more laughter from the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila couldn't help but tease. "So, when's the wedding? We can't wait to celebrate with you two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow wished she could find a hole to hide in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the playful banter, everyone's attention shifted to the last battlefield still in action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over 48 hundred Blood Demon members were locked in combat against hundreds of thousands of Dark Undeads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne announced, "Time's almost up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Dark Undead could only remain summoned for one day before they vanished, requiring him to expend a significant amount of divine and soul power for each summoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the clock ticking, he noted that out of the one million Dark Undead he had summoned, only about 200 thousand remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive! In just one day, the Blood Demon members have taken down nearly 800 thousand Dark Undeads. Sure, they've revived an average of six times each, but they've definitely improved since before," Osborne remarked, genuinely pleased with the Blood Demon's fighting prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One million Dark Undeads? Osborne was confident that even against the combined forces of Wild Flame Army, Inferno Army, Thunderwind Army, and Firestorm Army, totaling over two million troops, a million Dark Undeads could wipe them out in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here they were, struggling against the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the ability to revive kept them from total defeat, it was their sheer skill that allowed them to slay 800 thousand Dark Undead amidst the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is insane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're so strong! If all the Blood Demon members could break through to Deity King, they could change the tide of a battle involving millions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group couldn't help but marvel at their performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even at the peak of Deity King, a warrior would have a rough time against the Blood Demon members! Their teamwork is just on another level! And with the ability to revive, it's downright demoralizing," Anastasia added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the number of Dark Undead dwindled to around 200 thousand, the Blood Demon members, after a day of defense, finally launched their counterattack. Like a spear, they pierced through the ranks of Dark Undead, led by three hundred Deity King warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, fewer than 50 thousand Dark Undeads vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The time was up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members had withstood the onslaught of one million Dark Undeads for an entire day, taking down a staggering 950 thousand of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The victory left every Blood Demon member feeling exhilarated, their bodies radiating an aura of blood energy and menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any ordinary army would probably hesitate to even approach them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great job, everyone! Go rest up and keep honing your skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, and the Blood Demon members' battered bodies instantly healed, allowing them to return to their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hope Haven has been through two hundred days, and the outside world has passed two days as well! The time we set for the arena challenge has arrived! Now, it's time for us to step out and face the geniuses from all the races!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, determination flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time laying out their next move. "After this, we're leaving East Zone behind and heading to West Zone, the settlement under Human Community's control. Are you guys ready to take on all the geniuses from the various races who'll show up in the arena? We're going to prove just how tough the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings' really are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze swept over the group, and in their eyes, he saw flames of eagerness burning fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For weeks now, they'd been on the receiving end of Osborne's Spatial Clones and the relentless assaults of Blood Demon members. Tired of taking hits, they were more than ready to dish out some pain of their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The time had finally come to face the prodigies of other races and let off some steam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been chomping at the bit for this!" Bryce's voice trembled with excitement, and his body practically vibrated from the thrill. "I'm so ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me too! I've been itching to get my hands on these so-called prodigies. As long as none of them are as freakishly strong as Osborne, we've got this in the bag!" another chimed in, and his fists clenched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as none of them are as freakishly strong as Osborne, we've got this in the bag!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get moving already!" someone else urged, and their voice was fired up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!" the group roared in unison, and their eyes gleamed with fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned, feeling the intensity of their collective resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, nodding approvingly, "That's the spirit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's give those geniuses out there a shock they won't forget. We're going to make sure our names shine across Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they exited Hope Haven, ready to take on the prodigies of every race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, near Divine Peak Nine, the massive floating arena was already surrounded by a sea of warriors from various races.</span></p></div>
