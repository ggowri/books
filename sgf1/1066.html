        <h1>Chapter 1065 Blood Demon Takes Action</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's face showed disdain. "If it were Sebastian using the Godfather's scepter, I might have been wary. But it's you, Wesson. You are not worthy of using it. So, just give it to me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Gerardo launched his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's expression changed dramatically. Gerardo's speed was too fast. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of Wesson, reaching out to snatch the Godfather's scepter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Wesson reacted quickly, immediately swinging the Godfather's scepter </span><span>down against Gerardo's hand. Gerardo's palm exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force erupted from the Godfather's scepter, sending Gerardo flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo looked at his shattered hand, somewhat in disbelief, but then turned his gaze back to the Godfather's scepter in Wesson's hand, greed shining even more fiercely in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph. I underestimated the Godfather's scepter. It seems I must kill you if I want to get it. In that case, I will kill you. Fusion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo shouted, and his body began to undergo drastic changes, soon taking on the form of the goddess Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His exploded hand fully restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying power erupted from Gerardo's body, causing everyone present to feel immense pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo sneered, "Wesson, it's all over! Without your assistance, those worthless fools won't hold out for long. They will be killed off soon. And you will be next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson tensed up, his complexion turning ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was highly unfavorable to them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the coalition forces had a significant advantage in fighting the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' army with combat drones and robots, they had suffered substantial losses yet were still on the path to victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with another one hundred Class S clones, the combat drones and robots suddenly felt more like decorations, their numbers rapidly dwindling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle had entered a meat grinder mode. The casualties among the coalition forces were increasing, and there was no hope of victory in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even worse was the plight of the nearly fifty Class S warriors, who were now down to only forty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their opponents, over five hundred Class S clones, were launching a frenzied siege, with someone dying every moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the only one with a chance to turn the tide, Wesson, was entangled with Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we really going to lose?" Wesson felt immense anguish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's roll!" But just then, a powerful shout suddenly rang out, accompanied by a terrifying battle intent that dispersed some of the dark clouds above. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following that, a team that no one had noticed finally moved out. It was the Blood Demon Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly five thousand members of the Blood Demon Organization seemed quite insignificant compared to the nearly fifty thousand strong coalition forces. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had remained hidden until the situation turned unfavorable, and they finally decided to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their target was not the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' army but rather the over five hundred Class S clones attacking Bryce and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members of the Blood Demon Vanguard, such as First Augustine and Ninety-third Augustine, charged to the forefront, raising their super energy guns and aiming at a group of Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When a divine power bullet from the super energy gun hit a clone, it broke through </span><span>their defenses and caused an explosion. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it did not kill the clone, it seriously injured him, and subsequent divine power bullets shattered his body into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of these super energy guns was at least equal to that of the massive energy cannons but offered far more flexibility and precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, regular members of the Blood Demon Organization pulled their triggers, using ordinary energy guns to attack the clones. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These energy guns had undergone special modifications. While they were less potent than the super energy guns, they were still much stronger than standard energy weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One energy gun could not breach the defenses of a Class S clone, but one hundred or a thousand energy guns striking the same Class S clone simultaneously could easily kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members of the Blood Demon Organization were well-trained, and with their sudden arrival, over twenty clones were quickly killed, greatly relieving the pressure on Bryce and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members continued to pull their triggers coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, clones fell under their fire, like chopped trees. Waves upon waves collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several rounds of shooting, without any physical engagement, at least one hundred clones had been blasted apart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the addition of the Blood Demon Organization members, the tide of battle began to change once again.</span></p></div>
