        <h1>Chapter 2572 The Powerful Seraphina-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The battle on the arena was incredibly intense."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Every prodigy emerging from the zone duel is incredibly powerful. In fact, each of them possesses the strength to defeat an ordinary warrior at the primary Empyrean Sacredness level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At the very least, they have fused three types of powers in advance, possess two or three Mid-grade Sacred Artifacts, and can fully unleash the power of the Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, the rules of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel are very cruel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each group has eleven people, but only two will advance, while the rest will be eliminated. Among these two, one is bound to be a prince or princess of the Glorious Divine Kingdom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In other words, only one out of the ten prodigies emerging from the zone duel can advance. A chaotic battle will directly eliminate nine prodigies."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For this, everyone gave it their all; no one wanted to give up the chance to enter the top twenty."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With a boom, various powerful attacks erupted. One contestant after another was defeated, injured, and then either fell off the stage or directly surrendered."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The pace of the competition was extremely fast."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, in a situation where Offensive Sacred Artifacts can be used but Defensive Sacred Artifacts cannot, most cultivators' defenses are inadequate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as they get hit, they are easily defeated."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only those with extraordinary talent from powerful races, like the Magma Devourer among Silicon-based Lifeforms or the Astralwreck Dragon like Flash, can have defenses stronger than their attacks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, the people on the stage don't have such strong defenses. So, attacking and dodging are the keys to victory."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In just a few minutes, eight people from the first group had already been knocked out of the ring, losing directly. At this moment, still fighting were Mason, ranked tenth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, and a warrior ranked in the top twenty of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Finally, Mason displayed greater strength and blasted his opponent out of the ring. He immediately threw his head back and roared excitedly, overwhelmed with emotion, because after defeating this opponent, only he and Seraphina were left on the stage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This means he has advanced."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, he will face Seraphina to determine who will be the group champion."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, Mason looked at Seraphina."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seraphina had been standing at the center of the ring all along. No matter how intense the battles around her were, she remained indifferent, and no one dared to attack her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This was a bit boring for Seraphina."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, seeing that the others had finally decided the outcome and only Mason was left on the ring besides her, she couldn't help but smile and say, 'Are you going to admit defeat?'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After hearing her words, Mason said with a serious expression, 'Of course, I won't admit defeat. Princess Seraphina, I know I probably can't match you, but it's rare for me to have the chance to face you. I don't want to waste this opportunity.'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Seraphina, let me see just how big the gap is between me and you, the number one in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Mason unleashed an even stronger Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that he hadn't been giving his all earlier, many spectators couldn't help but show surprised expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man said, "Mason is impressive. He hadn't been going all out earlier, yet he still dared to challenge Princess Seraphina. He's truly courageous, worthy of being ranked tenth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. If the princes and princesses weren't participating, he would most likely be the champion of this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel."</span></p></div>
