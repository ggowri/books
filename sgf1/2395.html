        <h1>Chapter 2313 Osborne's Return-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the instant Osborne materialized on the fifth layer's Translocator, his mug was plastered all over the projection screens above Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, most of the spectators were too busy watching the mayhem unfold on the first layer to even notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those who did notice didn't give it a second thought, except for Angela.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's eyes locked onto the Translocator on the fifth layer the moment a figure popped into existence. She froze, her heart skipping a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Seriously? It's the sixth day of the state duel, and someone's just now crawling out of the sixth layer? Someone strong enough to reach the sixth layer didn't bother looting other teams and instead just chilled there the whole time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of confusion washed over Angela's face as she squinted, trying to get a better look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Angela went rigid, and in a flash, she was on her feet, her face a mask of disbelief, her cheeks flushed. A wild buzz of excitement coursed through her veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sudden outburst startled Danilo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up? What's wrong? Ms. Olsen, what is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was practically vibrating with excitement. Hearing Danilo's voice, she frantically jabbed a finger at the corner of the projection screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne... Osborne, he's not dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's alive! Right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's words left Danilo utterly flabbergasted. He whipped his head around and saw Osborne had just strolled back to the fourth layer through the fifth layer's Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked like he'd just stepped out of a spa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few moments of unadulterated joy, Angela managed to pull herself together. She flashed a smile and said, "Good, he's not dead! Good! But he had the nerve to scare me half to death like that. Just wait until I get my hands on him, I'll give him a piece of my mind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Angela plopped back down in her seat, her face glowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo, however, was still trying to wrap his head around it. "Osborne emerged from the sixth layer? You're telling me he's been holed up in the sixth layer for the last six days? He survived six days in the sixth layer, and he's still breathing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His jaw practically hit the floor. "Only the top twenty could pull off something like that, right? Does Osborne even have that kind of strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shot him a quick glance and chuckled. "Who cares whether he does or doesn't? If he does, awesome! If not, so what? The important thing is he's alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo nodded in agreement. "What a bummer, though! He must've run into some kind of trouble in the sixth layer, and gotten stuck in a relatively safe zone! That's the only way to explain why the referees couldn't find him! And it's the only way he could've survived that long in the sixth layer without his score budging an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's only got 300 thousand points right now... that puts him way outside the top fifty. Even though there's still a day left in the state duel, there's no way he can rack up a decent score! Plus, with only 300 thousand points, he's gonna be a prime target for the heavy hitters once he gets back to the first layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those powerhouses won't give him an inch. They'll definitely try to bleed him dry of points! I wonder how many points he'll manage to hold onto in the end, and if he'll even stay in the top hundred!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can stay in the top hundred, he'll have already made history for our Mystic Sirius Sect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Angela couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold onto the top hundred? I think... he can definitely do that! I believe in him! In fact, I'm betting his score will shoot up, and he'll crack the top fifty for sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo stared at Angela, his eyebrows shooting up in surprise. "Ms. Olsen, you really have that much faith in Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shook her head. "Nope! This is me not having faith in him! If I actually had faith in him... well, then I'd be saying I believe he can muscle his way into the top ten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo's jaw dropped even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela took a deep breath, trying to sound nonchalant. "Anyway, I'm just stoked he's back! From here on out, we'll just sit back and watch him do his thing. I don't give a damn about his final score anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Angela flashed a genuine smile. "Unless, of course, he actually pulls a rabbit out of his hat and cracks the top ten. Now that would really knock my socks off."</span></p></div>
