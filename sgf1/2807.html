        <h1>Chapter 2658 Entering the Skyfall Casket-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a day had passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished his training. Soon after, Clara, Leroy, and Casey also completed theirs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, each of them was dressed in a beautiful snow-white battle armor. The armor fully enveloped their bodies, radiating the energy of a Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, the three of them had already mastered the Legendary Sacred Artifact Armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the armor on, their defense became incredibly strong. Although they were only at primary Empyrean Sacredness, even a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, or even Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, couldn't easily break through their defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, the Legendary Sacred Artifact consumed their Sacred Power significantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the three of them took off their armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "If I use all my Sacred Power for defense, I can probably last two hours. If I fight while defending, my Sacred Power will be depleted quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I'll keep the armor stored away usually and only use it when facing overwhelming danger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Leroy nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her strength was similar to Clara's, and she couldn't wear the armor all the time. Otherwise, her Sacred Power would be exhausted in just two hours.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey was slightly weaker. "Even if I focus entirely on defense, my Sacred Power can barely last an hour. However, since it's Legendary Sacred Artifact Armor, it provides full protection. If I really face danger, it will definitely save my life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Your cultivation level is too low. Once you reach advanced Empyrean Sacredness, you won't need to worry about the energy consumption of the Legendary Sacred Artifact Armor. By then, you can wear the armor anytime, anywhere, without fearing ambushes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey all nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They certainly knew it was because their cultivation level was too low.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "But improving cultivation level isn't that easy. Especially after reaching Empyrean Sacredness, if we want to keep breaking through, it takes decades, centuries, or even millennia. By the time we reach advanced Empyrean Sacredness, it will probably be at least a few hundred years later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the three of them looked at Osborne with some envy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before entering Celestial Spire, although Osborne was powerful, he was at the same cultivation level as them. However, after reaching Empyrean Sacredness, they were only at primary Empyrean Sacredness, while Osborne had already reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's cultivation speed was simply terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Will it take you hundreds of years to reach advanced Empyrean Sacredness? Not necessarily." Osborne smiled and pointed at the Eighth Skyfall Casket, saying, "You might reach advanced Empyrean Sacredness very soon. In fact, if you're a bit lucky, your cultivation level might surpass mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Clara, Leroy, and Casey immediately widened their eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is that possible?" Clara, Leroy, and Casey said simultaneously, all in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why is it impossible?" Osborne said, "Don't forget how the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet suddenly emerged tens of thousands of years ago. They obtained the key to the Ninth Skyfall Casket in the Celestial Spire and then entered the Ninth Skyfall Casket together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eventually, when the twelve of them emerged from the Ninth Skyfall Casket, nine had already reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, or even Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. The other three were even more formidable, becoming true warriors at Imperial Empyrean Sacredness. On the Racial Convergence Planet, no one could defeat them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This shows that the opportunities within the Skyfall Casket are immense, even beyond our imagination. Otherwise, Frederick wouldn't be so excited. So, after entering the Skyfall Casket, your cultivation level has a chance to rise rapidly.</span></p></div>
