        <h1>Chapter 2617 Black Whirlpool</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this situation, Osborne felt very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick invited the top experts of these forces to explore Necropolis City because he promised them benefits, and each force could receive twenty Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is indeed a deal hard to refuse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Frederick didn't have time to deal with this at the moment. While they were trading, Osborne quickly took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Time Retrace!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye flickered briefly before quickly dimming. In that instant, he had already used Time Retrace to see the scene where Frederick designed the teleportation coordinates on the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That coordinate was naturally memorized by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This coordinate..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Why does this feel so strange? It's neither within the cosmos nor in deep space. I've never seen such coordinates before."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can this translocator be teleported to this coordinate?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne carefully looked at the Cosmic Translocator under his feet again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he couldn't help but feel very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey! This Cosmic Translocator has an issue; it has some extra parts compared to a regular Cosmic Translocator. I mistakenly thought their skills were too low before, but now I realize maybe these extra parts are what brought us to this strange coordinate!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quickly note down every detail of the Cosmic Translocator!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt he had discovered a secret.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they wanted to go to Necropolis City, they would need not only special coordinates but also a special Cosmic Translocator; missing either wouldn't work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne finally discovered the problem. Otherwise, even if he had noted down the coordinates, the Cosmic Translocator he built wouldn't have been able to transport him to Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne memorized every detail of this Cosmic Translocator, Adriana and the others also stepped onto the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana instinctively walked to a spot not far from Osborne. This way, if anything happened to Osborne, she could react in time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Adriana's voice echoed in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, be careful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After entering Necropolis City, don't stray too far from me. Remember to be cautious! Also, the person next to me is the Vice Palace Master of the Fairy Moon Sect. Her name is May Ramirez!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"May is very trustworthy, and she knows your identity. If I'm not by your side, you can go to May for anything!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded slightly after hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's set off!" Frederick said calmly at this moment. However, Osborne vaguely felt that Frederick was suppressing his inner excitement and thrill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Frederick personally activated the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A vast power immediately enveloped everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, everyone vanished from the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a strong sense of dizziness. Under normal circumstances, this feeling would quickly fade. After all, he had spatial power and was long accustomed to teleportation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this time, the dizziness lasted much longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time Osborne felt his feet on solid ground, a long time had passed. The people around him, including Clara, Leroy, Seraphina, and others, immediately collapsed to the ground and started vomiting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't handle the dizziness from the teleportation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Except for Osborne, everyone who hadn't reached Empyrean Sacredness was vomiting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the princes, princesses, or royal guards who had reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection were dry-heaving, their faces extremely pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Frederick, Adriana, and other powerhouses who had reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness appeared very calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching everyone vomiting, Frederick just smiled calmly. However, when he noticed that Osborne, though pale, seemed relatively fine, he was immediately surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he shifted his gaze to the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're almost there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne quickly looked around. He noticed they were on a small meteorite, surrounded by an endless starry sky with few stars.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Above them, there was a massive Black Whirlpool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The whirlpool was emanating a terrifying power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a chill run down his spine with just one glance, as if approaching it would mean certain death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, Frederick pointed at the massive Black Whirlpool and calmly said, "Necropolis City is inside this Black Whirlpool!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Necropolis City is inside this Black Whirlpool?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana murmured. She stared at the Black Whirlpool, her expression extremely serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you sure? This Black Whirlpool is terrifying. Even if we join forces, we might be torn apart. Moreover, we have brought along hundreds of burdens who haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness. Protecting them while entering this vortex will be very difficult..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick heard this and smiled faintly, "We won't be mistaken. I've been here many times. Everyone, rest assured. Although this vortex is terrifying, we can definitely handle it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everything is within my expectations!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The reason I invited you to enter Necropolis City, this land of opportunity, is to protect those who haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They are very important to us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only they can enter the Celestial Spire, and only within the Celestial Spire can we obtain the key to fully uncover the secrets of this land of opportunity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, it would be meaningless for us to go in. If not to protect them, I wouldn't have invited you. With the power of the royal family alone, we could easily enter Necropolis City."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Frederick finished speaking, Adriana remained silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, her expression remained grave. Just by seeing the intensity of this Black Whirlpool, she knew their exploration of Necropolis City would be extremely dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let them rest for a while. Let's take action first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Those who have reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness will act with me. Let's first carve out a passage through this Black Whirlpool!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick took the lead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He swiftly flew toward the Black Whirlpool, his body appearing so tiny in front of it, like an ant approaching a massive planet...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, an incredibly terrifying power erupted around him, and the dark brown Panoply Armor on his body glowed, making him appear like a giant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he raised his hands, a terrifying power began to converge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista, Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and over a dozen Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness experts from the royal family quickly followed Frederick. They raised their hands high, gathering immense power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Adriana, May, and the others also began to act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nearly fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness experts from various major forces all flew to Frederick's side, gathering immense power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, their powers converged into a dazzling, colorful sun.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick suddenly pointed at the Black Whirlpool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately unleashed the power he controlled and blasted it forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Open it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, everyone's power erupted. The strength of over sixty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness-level experts looked incredibly terrifying as they blasted it onto the massive Black Whirlpool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the terrifying tremor, the Black Whirlpool was instantly torn open with a crack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a passage appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly looked at the situation inside the crack...</span></p></div>
