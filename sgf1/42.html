        <h1>Chapter 42 Scathing Tirade</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh, sneering. &ldquo;Wesley, I called you out by name, and you still have the nerve to ask who the lapdog is? Did you leave your brain at home? The way you grovel, isn&rsquo;t that exactly what a lapdog does?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;And I was clearly insulting you, so how did it become an insult to Ms. Radcliffe in your twisted mind? Do you think Ms. Radcliffe lacks intelligence like you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Vulgar? So what if I&rsquo;m vulgar? What are you going to do? Bite me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s face contorted in disgust as he unleashed a scathing tirade against Wesley, leaving both Wesley and Ophelia stunned. Wesley, in particular, was seething with anger, wanting to retort and insult Osborne back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But glancing at Clarissa, he restrained himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I endure</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> Wesley thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">I must maintain my composure</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> I absolutely cannot act as recklessly as Osborne, who&rsquo;s like a rabid dog, embarrassing himself in front of Ms. Radcliffe</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clenching his jaw, Wesley simmered with suppressed rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Little did he know, Clarissa was observing the situation with curiosity, her beautiful eyes reflecting genuine interest in Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For her, the typical flattery she received from people like Wesley was nothing new. Many individuals with even more prestigious backgrounds than Wesley went to greater lengths to flatter her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, encountering someone like Osborne, who dared to use harsh language and insult others in her presence, was entirely novel to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This novelty intrigued Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She found Osborne&rsquo;s unfiltered reactions refreshing and authentic&mdash;a stark contrast to the restrained gentlemanly facades put on by others when challenged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In fact, she felt a surge of fondness towards Osborne rather than revulsion at his &ldquo;vulgarity&rdquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Wesley knew, he would probably be fuming with jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alas, he remained unaware of Clarissa&rsquo;s thoughts, still convinced that Osborne&rsquo;s crude words had turned her against Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Osborne looked back at him icily, Wesley returned to his seat, glaring at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ignoring Wesley as if he didn&rsquo;t exist, Osborne mulled over how to broach the subject of becoming Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, the formal lunch began.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia and Wesley continued their efforts to impress Clarissa. Ophelia demonstrated more tact than Wesley, wisely avoiding provoking Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After their flattery session, Clarissa surprisingly warmed up to Ophelia, even exchanging contact information with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This thrilled Ophelia, fueling her efforts to please even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne remained mostly silent, observing Ophelia&rsquo;s performance with detached amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To his surprise, his proud ex-wife was now bending over backward to please someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Indeed, the power of influence, Osborne thought, studying Clarissa with a watchful eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He noticed that, contrary to her cool exterior, she was unexpectedly approachable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although of noble status, she wasn&rsquo;t aloof.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, a sense of distance always lingered around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the banquet neared its end, Osborne knew he couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer. It was time to act.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as he prepared to make a move, Clarissa said first, &ldquo;Mr. Augustine, did you bring that painting with you? Could I see it again?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne froze, halting his preparations and retrieving the artwork.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa took it carefully as if holding the most precious treasure, her beautiful eyes filled with nostalgia and tenderness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This surprised Ophelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To her, the painting seemed quite ordinary, so much so that even knowing Clarissa painted it, she didn&rsquo;t know how to praise it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a moment of hesitation, Ophelia asked, &ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, does this painting hold any special meaning for you? You seem to care a lot about it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa smiled faintly and nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It does have a special meaning for me because it&rsquo;s the first painting I ever did. The content on it represents the most cherished memory of my life.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before Ophelia could ask more, Clarissa continued, &ldquo;I was only five years old that year. I was born into the Radcliffe family, and while my parents and elders loved me dearly, I felt like a canary trapped in a cage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I had to learn so many things, piano, violin, various languages, all of which I didn&rsquo;t enjoy. In reality, I just wanted to be like other children, with many friends my age, free to play in the fields without a care in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That day, my father told me he had hired a famous painter to teach me how to paint, and I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore. So, I sneaked out.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she spoke, Clarissa seemed lost in her memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia, Wesley, and Osborne remained silent, listening intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The escape that day is a memory I can never forget. It was unforgettable because I was in danger. I got lost in a dark alley, terrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;But then, a group of terrifying wolves appeared out of nowhere, snarling at me with sharp teeth. I was scared, crying, frozen in fear, thinking I was going to die.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia gasped, exclaiming, &ldquo;Wolves?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The wolves in the painting?&rdquo;</p></div>
