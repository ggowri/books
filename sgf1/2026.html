        <h1>Chapter 2018 Eight Against a Hundred-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those on the Paramount Supreme Clan's side were even more shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings had reappeared! Not only that, they had broken through from mid Deity King Level to Ascension One Supernal Deity King in such a short time, now standing on the border competition's arena!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alongside the Seven Young Deity Kings was Hannah from the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the eight of them stood in the arena at this moment, staring down at them with arrogant expressions and provocative gazes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What were they planning to do?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the sky, the massive divine power projection of Icy One appeared once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Osborne and the others in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?! I never expected your cultivation to advance so quickly! Just a few months ago, you were only at mid Deity King Level, weren't you? It seems the Human Community has invested heavily in your training!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's gaze shifted to the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's divine power projection also appeared, hovering near Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was worried that Icy One might suddenly attack Osborne and his group, so she was there to protect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Icy One's words, the God of Light wanted to tell him that the Human Community hadn't invested any resources in Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their growth was entirely their own doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even speak, because this was Osborne's battle. As long as Icy One didn't forcibly intervene, she wouldn't interfere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Icy One and said, "Can we skip the small talk? Hurry up and send your Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses up here. We can't wait to kill a few more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A hundred Ascension One Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses. Send them up to die! Once we've finished them off, there are still three more matches to go. Let's not waste any time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finish the matches quickly so you can start your retreat. After all, today you'll be retreating 5 million miles. With so many people in the Dark Deity Legion, I'm afraid you won't have enough time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One couldn't help but laugh at Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retreat 5 million miles? Are you saying we won't win a single match today? That the Human Community will win all eight matches?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's face was full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where do you get such confidence? What nonsense is this 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings'? You're nothing! Even the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings wouldn't dare to be so arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, "My confidence comes from the Paramount Supreme Clan! It's because the Paramount Supreme Clan is so useless that I feel almost invincible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for whether the Human Community will win all eight matches today... From the moment I stepped into this arena, there was no longer any doubt. You will lose today. You won't win a single match!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One burst into laughter, but soon his expression turned icy, filled with killing intent. "Arrogant brat, you're digging your own grave! Since that's the case, I'll grant your wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure it's just the eight of you? Don't complain later that the Paramount Supreme Clan outnumbered you when you lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled. "Don't worry. It's just the eight of us. Eight is more than enough to deal with a hundred Paramount Supreme Clan trash at our level. Hurry up and send them up to die..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. In that case, prepare to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy One's divine power projection vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan stepped onto the arena, their faces cold and filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Osborne and the others, their minds replaying Icy One's earlier instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spare no effort to kill the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're so arrogant, thinking eight of them can take on a hundred. This is your chance! If a hundred of you can't kill eight of them...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then don't bother coming back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die in the arena!"</span></p></div>
