        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, he was reluctant to do so. If possible, he would rather kill Osborne directly, take all his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, and leave quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the current situation doesn't allow him to do so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind Osborne was the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, which even Lionel dared not approach easily. If he pushed Osborne into a corner, Osborne might rush in with the Kingdom Duel Badge, leaving him with nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he came up with this plan: exchange the Void Sword for Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge, and then find another opportunity to reclaim the Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he ultimately couldn't reclaim the Void Sword and Osborne took it into the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, he wouldn't care.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge was far more valuable than the Void Sword, Lionel naturally wouldn't let his efforts go to waste.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel shouted, "You'd better think carefully. This is your last chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If those people catch up later, even if I want to give you a chance to live and make this deal with you, they will never agree. By then, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll truly lose your life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can assure you, as long as you're willing to trade with me, I'll help divert the people behind. I'll tell everyone that your Kingdom Duel Badge has already been taken by me. This way, they won't keep chasing you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel looked at Osborne, trying his best to put on a sincere expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh inwardly. He naturally understood Lionel's intentions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel worried that he would directly take the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints into the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, leaving him with nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, although Lionel's Void Sword was a Supreme Sacred Artifact worth at least tens of billions of Sacred Crystals, it still paled in comparison to the over 46 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints in Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This old guy is probably trying to trick me into handing over the Kingdom Duel Badge first, then make a move on me. Once he gets the Badge, he'll definitely try to snatch my Void Sword right away. Even if he can't take it, he'd still profit! But, this might just be my chance!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne deliberately pretended to be deep in thought, as if seriously weighing Lionel's proposal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel started to appear a bit anxious. "Stop hesitating. You should know this is already the best option for you. Even though you'll lose the Kingdom Duel Badge, at least you'll keep your life and gain a Supreme Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>No one else would offer you a deal like this, not in a situation like this. If you don</span><span>'</span><span>t make up your mind soon, those others will catch up, and it</span><span>'</span><span>ll be too late</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finished speaking, and Osborne nodded. "You're right. I don't want to die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the current situation, handing over the Kingdom Duel Badge and getting a Supreme Sacred Artifact is already a decent outcome. However, I don't trust you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What if you take the Kingdom Duel Badge but refuse to give me the Void Sword? So, here's the deal: erase the imprint on the Void Sword first. If your imprint remains, even if I get the Void Sword, I can't control it, and with just a thought, you could turn it against me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Therefore, you must erase the imprint first. Then, you throw me the Void Sword, and I</span><span>'</span><span>ll throw you the Kingdom Duel Badge. That way, we can complete the deal smoothly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel hesitated upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Erasing the imprint on the Void Sword meant he would temporarily lose control of the weapon. If Osborne took it, it would be even harder to get it back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he also knew that to complete the deal, he had to earn Osborne's trust first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking for a moment, he nodded. "Alright. We'll do it your way. I'll erase the imprint on the Void Sword now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he swiftly wiped his palm over the Void Sword. Instantly, the Void Sword dimmed, and his connection to it was severed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel looked at Osborne. "Can we trade now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and nodded. "Alright! We'll count to three, then throw our items in opposite directions. We're about the same speed, so we can only grab one item each! This way, no one can cheat!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a cold glint flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p></div>
