        <h1>Chapter 1621 Exploitation and Oppression</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the past half hour, Osborne had been watching Diana closely as she worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was his first time witnessing someone extract Essence Crystals, and to him, the pace seemed painfully slow. Even with Diana's powerful earth elemental power, her vast experience, and a stroke of good luck, it took her a full thirty minutes to extract the first Ultimate Essence Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that amount of time, Osborne could have cleared out half the mine of Ultimate Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that was just Osborne's exceptional nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In reality, Diana's extraction speed was quite typical; she was already performing at a high level, comparable to a miner of a leader of ten thousand level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley, Emmett, and the others around her seemed quite satisfied with her progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Diana extracted the Ultimate Essence Crystal, Emmett rushed over, snatching it from her hands with a broad grin plastered across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes! Another Ultimate Essence Crystal for us to work with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley joined in the cheer, his eyes sparkling with excitement. "Let's get started! Just like before, I hope this time we all see some real improvements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emmett replied, his voice brimming with anticipation, "Of course we will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe this time, I'll finally break through to the peak of the Celestial Deity realm and become a Deity Overlord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let's congratulate Mr. Emmett Huntington in advance. You go first, and I'll keep watch. I'll wake you up every half hour," Riley said, clapping Emmett on the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sounds good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emmett settled down, crossing his legs and clutching the Ultimate Essence Crystal tightly as he began his meditation. The speed of cultivation was already impressive with the Ultimate Essence Crystal, but here, near Divine Peak Nine, his comprehension was boosted tenfold, allowing him to absorb the energy from the crystal at an astonishing rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that kind of setup, the pure energy within the Ultimate Essence Crystal was quickly consumed, and Emmett's energy surged as he progressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Riley and the rest of the guard team formed a protective circle around him, their eyes filled with envy as they watched Emmett absorb the crystal's energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thirty minutes later, Riley approached Emmett, channeling a surge of divine power to gently rouse him from his trance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill! Kill! Kill!" Emmett shouted as he jolted awake, his eyes ablaze with fierce intent, almost appearing to be lost in a fevered vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It took him a moment to regain his composure, letting out a long breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That was close! I almost got trapped in that vision! It looks like half an hour isn't safe anymore. Mr. Riley Raglan, next time, wake me up in twenty-five minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got it!" Riley nodded enthusiastically, eager to take his turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without wasting any time, Riley grabbed the Ultimate Essence Crystal from Emmett, settling into a cross-legged position of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Emmett Huntington, wake me up in ten minutes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Riley began his meditation, while Emmett and the others stood guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, however, was left scratching his head in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reality of the mining operation was turning out to be quite different from what he had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "Aren't we supposed to be protecting Diana and Emmett, the two miners, while they extract Ultimate Essence Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why is Emmett not mining himself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, he's taking the Ultimate Essence Crystal that Diana worked so hard to extract for his own cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Diana seems perfectly fine with that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Furrowing his brow, Osborne approached Diana, lowering his voice to a whisper through his mind, "Diana, what's going on? Why are you giving the Ultimate Essence Crystal you mined to Emmett? Isn't he a miner, too? Why isn't he the one extracting it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana paused in her work, finally taking a moment to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rocks near Divine Peak Nine were incredibly tough, and using her earth elemental power to extract the Essence Crystals was taking a toll on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, she needed to catch her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glanced over at Emmett, Riley, and the others before responding calmly, "This is why they think I'm still useful and won't turn against me. Each time I come here to mine for Essence Crystals, they focus solely on their own cultivation to boost their power, and the mining part is always left to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Essence Crystals I extract&mdash;some are kept for their training, and a portion goes to Emmett so he can turn them in back at base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Normally, during a task, I can mine about a hundred Ultimate Essence Crystals, but I only get to take back ten for myself to submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The other ninety? A chunk is for their training, and the rest Emmett takes back under his name to submit for the task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, he wouldn't stand a chance of becoming a miner of leaders of ten thousand level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes were filled with disdain when she spoke about Emmett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, however, felt a surge of disbelief. "Isn't this exploitation? They're squeezing you dry. They don't do anything, not even protect you, and yet they take nine-tenths of what you've worked hard to mine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't hide his displeasure, which deepened at the thought of the injustice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana sighed, her expression resigned, "There's nothing I can do about it. This has always been the way things are. I'm just part of the Human Community; I can't fight back. If I didn't go along with it, I wouldn't have survived this long..."</span></p></div>
