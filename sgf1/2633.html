        <h1>Chapter 2519 Unexpected Discovery</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without the Heaven Arrow, Osborne can only attack with the Earth Arrow. If the Earth Arrow's strongest move, Arrow Storm, targets a single enemy, its power is still strong enough to injure an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that's all it can do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne wants to kill an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demon, he would need to use the Earth Arrow's Arrow Storm at least a dozen times to possibly succeed. Even with Flash's support, it would still take them quite some time to take down one Illusionary Heavenly Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the other Illusionary Heavenly Demons won't stay still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they don't coordinate with each other, they share the same thought: to destroy everything in front of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their attacks are not something Flash and Osborne can withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Flash and Osborne can only retreat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne used interdimensional travel. Soon, he took Flash far away from the group of Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a target, they could only turn back into meteorites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a powerful Demon Dragon's Breath was between Osborne's palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "An Illusionary Heavenly Demon at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection can transform into such a pure and dense Demon Dragon's Breath! A Dragon Elixir condensed from such Demon Dragon's Breath would undoubtedly be incredibly powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, we have no way to kill a thousand Illusionary Heavenly Demons at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a thousand Demon Dragon's Breaths, they cannot merge or condense into a Dragon Elixir, nor can they be absorbed or produce any effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the Phantomagic Realm disappears, the Demon Dragon's Breath will also vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "I must find a way to gather a thousand Demon Dragon's Breaths at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly thought of a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only use the Heaven Arrow, unleashing his strongest attack, to truly kill the Illusionary Heavenly Demon at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. But he could only use the Heaven Arrow once every half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He needed half an hour to kill one Illusionary Heavenly Demon. If he wanted to kill a thousand, he would need 500 hours, which is 21 days!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Phantomagic Realm would only exist for one month. It was already the 14th day. Even if they did nothing else for the next 16 days and focused solely on killing these Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons, they still couldn't gather a thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do I have to give up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless. Unless his Heaven Arrow's cooldown time became shorter, they wouldn't be able to gather a thousand Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Demon Dragon's Breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Make the cooldown time shorter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly thought of a solution and murmured, "I have time powers. Can I use Time Acceleration on myself to shorten the cooldown time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For example, if I use a hundredfold Time Acceleration, wouldn't the actual cooldown time of Heaven Arrow also shorten by a hundred times? With just a cooldown time of a dozen seconds, could I use Heaven Arrow again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought he could give it a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately cast Time Acceleration around himself, accelerating by ten thousand times. Only less than a second passed in the outside world, but he had already experienced a long three hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he canceled Time Acceleration, he felt a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cooldown time of Heaven Arrow didn't change!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be that this doesn't work? Or did I use too high a multiplier for Time Acceleration?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne decided to keep trying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, he applied a thousand times Time Acceleration around himself, but after testing, it still didn't work. The rules of heaven and earth in the Time Acceleration area were different, so the cooldown time of Heaven Arrow didn't change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne tested a hundred times Time Acceleration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the result was still no.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it really not work? Fine, I'll test ten times Time Acceleration one last time! If it still doesn't work, then there's nothing I can do, and no need to keep testing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Osborne applied ten times Time Acceleration around himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three minutes passed outside, while Osborne had already spent half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, after deactivating Time Acceleration, he discovered that his Heaven Arrow could be used!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It worked! It actually worked!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was pleasantly surprised. Although the Heaven Arrow's cooldown time could only be shortened under ten times Time Acceleration, it was enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, he would have to wait thirty minutes to use the Heaven Arrow a second time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he only needs three minutes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In one hour, Osborne can use the Heaven Arrow twenty times, which means nearly five hundred arrows in a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just two or three days, he can use the Heaven Arrow to kill a thousand Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons, gather a thousand Demon Dragon's Breath, and forge a stronger Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very happy. Being able to use the Heaven Arrow more frequently greatly enhanced his strength. Before, he could only use it once every half an hour, so he didn&rsquo;t dare to use it recklessly and could only treat it as a trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, he can use it once every three minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He no longer needs to hold back. He can completely treat the Heaven Arrow as his regular attack method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I can't waste time! I must quickly kill a thousand Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons! I can feel that stronger Dragon Elixir will greatly enhance my strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne immediately took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, he no longer needed Flash's help because Flash couldn't withstand the siege of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons, and his attacks couldn't inflict fatal injuries on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Osborne could handle it on his own!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used interdimensional travel and instantly appeared near the group of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons. As they twisted and deformed, he swiftly drew the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's Heaven Arrow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne released the bowstring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As his trump card and strongest attack, the terrifying power of Heaven Arrow erupted once again. An Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demon was instantly obliterated, with even its corpse annihilated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He reached out and grabbed a wisp of Demon Dragon's Breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, without waiting for the other Illusionary Heavenly Demons to launch an attack, Osborne used interdimensional travel again and quickly escaped to a safe distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he immediately cast tenfold Time Acceleration on himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three minutes later, Heaven Arrow's cooldown time ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne used interdimensional travel to approach again, unleashed Heaven Arrow to kill an Illusionary Heavenly Demon, and immediately used interdimensional travel to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That group of Illusionary Heavenly Demons showed neither fear nor anger. They were simply activated repeatedly, then calmed down again when they couldn't find a target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this situation, they completely became Osborne's targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their numbers quickly decreased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne killed an Illusionary Heavenly Demon every three minutes or so. After more than five hours, he finally wiped out all one hundred Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also collected one hundred Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Demon Dragon's Breaths!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got a hundred!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nine hundred more to go, and I can form a higher-level Dragon Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was very excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must continue searching for Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons. No matter what, I have to gather a thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he found the second group of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the slaughter began again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time passed quickly. Over two days went by in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne had been in the Phantomagic Realm for a full fifteen days.</span></p></div>
