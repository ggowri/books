        <h1>Chapter 11 Get Away</h1>
        <div><p>Ophelia clenched her fists tightly, glaring at Osborne angrily. Meanwhile, she&#x27;d already made up her mind in her heart.</p><p>&quot;Get out of here!&quot; she snapped.</p><p>Justin&#x27;s face instantly paled. &quot;No way! Absolutely not gonna let him go!&quot;</p><p>If Osborne left, there&#x27;d be no way for him to prove that the explosives on Osborne were fake.</p><p>Ophelia shot him a look of disdain. &quot;Justin, don&#x27;t forget who you are. I&#x27;m the heir of the Caldwell family now!&quot;</p><p>Justin was furious but couldn&#x27;t utter a single word.</p><p>&quot;Justin, you&#x27;d better watch your own back! If I find out you ever poisoned me and had your personal bodyguard try to assassinate me, you know what will happen,&quot; Ophelia sneered.</p><p>Justin&#x27;s face turned even grimmer.</p><p>He stared daggers at Osborne, his eyes blazing with murderous intent as if he wanted to devour Osborne alive.</p><p>Ophelia locked her cold eyes on Osborne. &quot;Okay, Osborne, I&#x27;ll own up. I&#x27;m beat today. But you better pray you never end up in my clutches. The Caldwell family&#x27;s money? It&#x27;s not some easy pickings.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;ll burn your hands if you&#x27;re not careful.&quot;</p><p>Osborne shrugged nonchalantly. &quot;Don&#x27;t you worry about that. Since I dared to take it, I&#x27;m not afraid of any consequences.&quot;</p><p>With that, Osborne didn&#x27;t waste another word and headed out of the villa.</p><p>The members of the Caldwell family stepped aside, not daring to stop him.</p><p>&quot;Ophelia, you just let that bastard go? That&#x27;s 20 million dollars! How are you gonna explain this to the Elder Council?&quot; Evelyn gritted her teeth, her eyes fixed on the direction where Osborne had disappeared.</p><p>Ophelia shook her head. &quot;Mom, I couldn&#x27;t take the risk. What if the explosives were real? It&#x27;d only play into Justin&#x27;s hands. So I had to let Osborne go. As for the Elder Council, I&#x27;ll handle it.</p><p>&quot;The money of the Caldwell family isn&#x27;t easy to take. I&#x27;ll settle this score with him sooner or later,&quot; Ophelia said, her face still gloomy with anger.</p><p>She&#x27;d been extorted 20 million dollars in cash by the once-looked-down-upon loser, Osborne. It was like getting slapped in the face several times. How could she not be enraged?</p><p>This grudge had to be avenged.</p><p>She&#x27;d make sure Osborne got the money but couldn&#x27;t spend it!</p><p>Evelyn opened her mouth but didn&#x27;t say a word in the end. A crazy glint of murder flashed in her eyes.</p><p>On the other side, Osborne walked out of the Caldwell Estate.</p><p>Once he was far enough away, he started running like crazy.</p><p>&quot;Yes! I did it! I actually pulled it off!&quot;</p><p>Although Osborne had always appeared calm, only he knew how nervous he&#x27;d been.</p><p>Especially when Penelope exposed the fact that the explosives were fake, his heart almost jumped out of his chest.</p><p>Thankfully, he&#x27;d managed to outsmart Ophelia with his wits.</p><p>If Ophelia had been more decisive, he&#x27;d have been a goner.</p><p>Because, indeed, the explosives were fake.</p><p>He was just an ordinary civilian. How could he get his hands on high-powered explosives? He&#x27;d just used the fake ones to scare Ophelia.</p><p>Fortunately, everything had turned out okay.</p><p>&quot;Time to claim my reward! I wonder what the Godfather will give me,&quot; Osborne murmured, his eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p>There were ten levels in the heir test. Each time he passed a level, he&#x27;d inherit a part of the Godfather&#x27;s wealth and power.</p><p>But how could he contact the Godfather?</p><p>Just as Osborne was thinking about it, he saw a motorcycle speeding towards him.</p><p>On the cool-looking motorcycle sat a stunning woman wearing a red-and-black helmet.</p><p>Even though he couldn&#x27;t see her face clearly, just the sight of her long legs, perky butt, and graceful curves told him she was a real beauty.</p><p>But for some reason, Osborne sensed a faint threat from this woman on the motorcycle.</p><p>His face changed, and he quickly tried to hide in the woods by the roadside.</p><p>Before he could get away, the motorcycle suddenly accelerated and did a cool drift right in front of him, coming to a stop with a screech!</p><p>The woman propped her long leg on the ground, took off her helmet with a fluid motion, and let her wavy hair flow freely, revealing a perfectly gorgeous face.</p><p>She wore a playful smile as she looked at Osborne teasingly.</p><p>&quot;Why did you run when you saw me?</p><p>&quot;Are you really that much of a coward? Weren&#x27;t you quite brave back at the Caldwell Estate, scaring people with fake explosives?&quot;</p><p>Osborne&#x27;s face changed, and he eyed her warily. &quot;Who are you?&quot;</p><p>The woman said with a faint smile, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;m not from the Caldwell family.</p><p>&quot;My name is Isa Bowin. I&#x27;m a doctor, and people call me—The Reaper.</p><p>&quot;Oh, I&#x27;m here to give you your reward as ordered by the Godfather.&quot;</p><p>The Reaper?</p><p>And here to give a reward?!</p><p>Hearing that she was here with a reward, Osborne perked up with excitement.</p><p>&quot;What&#x27;s the reward?&quot;</p><p>Isa smiled gently. She puffed out her ample chest and pointed at her beautiful face. &quot;The reward is me! So, how do you like this reward? You can do whatever you want to me.&quot;</p><p>Osborne was instantly stunned.</p><p>The Godfather had rewarded him with a woman?</p><p>He stared at Isa&#x27;s face, truly amazed by her beauty.</p><p>She was really gorgeous and had an amazing figure. However, he couldn&#x27;t figure out why a beautiful girl like her, who was also a doctor, had the nickname the Reaper.</p><p>But getting a woman as a reward just didn&#x27;t seem worth it to him.</p><p>What Osborne needed most now was wealth, power, something that could change his current situation, not just a hot-bodied pretty woman he could have his way with in bed.</p><p>Thinking of this, Osborne let out a sigh.</p><p>But since the reward was a woman, he couldn&#x27;t complain about anything. He began to size her up from head to toe.</p><p>Seeing this, Isa shot him a glare.</p><p>&quot;Hey, you seem dissatisfied with me? Humph, you&#x27;re not even qualified to have me as your prize yet!&quot;</p><p>With that, Isa took out a smartwatch from her bag and casually tossed it to Osborne.</p><p>&quot;Here, your real reward is in this!&quot;</p></div>
