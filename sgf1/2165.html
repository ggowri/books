        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's expression shifted dramatically, her brows knitting together in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence has a trump card? Are you saying he has more warriors besides the five Dark Sovereigns?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa let out a cold laugh. "Of course he does!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The five Dark Sovereigns are nothing compared to what Lord Malevolence has up his sleeve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's not as simple as you think. When the God of Night led you all to defeat and seal him, do you really think he didn't learn from that experience? Don't forget, he hails from Racial Convergence Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He once built an empire there. Although he was ultimately defeated and driven out, he must have some powerful allies from those days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Facing the God of Night, Lord Malevolence doesn't have absolute confidence! So now that he's waging all-out war, you can bet he's called in his friends from Racial Convergence Planet to back him up... and those allies are definitely stronger than the five Dark Sovereigns!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are Lord Malevolence's real trump card against the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our true opponents are them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isa finished speaking, Clarissa's mouth dropped open, her brows furrowing deeper</span><span> and</span><span> her expression grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did the God of Night tell you all this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded. "He anticipated that Lord Malevolence would seek help from Racial Convergence Planet, which is why he had to take the risk and execute his plan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just hope it works out in time! If only he had twenty more years&mdash;no, just ten years would be enough! Given ten more years, Lord Malevolence would be no match for him. But sadly, we don't have that kind of time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa gritted her teeth and nodded firmly. "I believe he can do it! He is the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is... our master! He will succeed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Clarissa added, "Isa, I'm going back to train! In this life, my talent is even better than in my past life. I will become stronger and help him bear the burden!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa continued to gaze into the distance, murmuring to herself, "I believe he can do it too! Because he is the God of Night, my teacher... and my man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warm smile graced her lips, her face softening with longing. "It's been over twenty years..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Isa regained her composure and turned her attention back to Ophelia, who was waiting at the entrance of the Sanctum of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Isa vanished from the temple and reappeared in front of Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's eyes flew open, and she glared at Isa, her teeth clenched. "Isa, bring your teacher out to see me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied coolly, "God of Time, you really are persistent! I've already told you, my teacher isn't here at the Sanctum of Night! I have no reason to lie to you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, have you thought about it? The Paramount Supreme Clan has launched an all-out war against the Human Community. If he were here, do you think he wouldn't show himself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia frowned at her words. "Then where is he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to summon him! I want to ask him why he's treating me this way. He's the one who put me into reincarnation, the one who promised to marry me when I returned!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So why, why is he doing this? Is he deliberately avoiding me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger burned in Ophelia's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head in exasperation. "God of Time, now that you've regained your memories, surely you understand my teacher better than this? He keeps his promises!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The one who made a mistake here is you! You're the one who wronged him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia shouted, her voice filled with denial, "No! I didn't make a mistake! How could I have wronged him?! The reason my reincarnation married Osborne is that I hadn't regained my memories at that time! How can you blame me for that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should it be my fault? It's his fault for not finding me sooner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face twisted with rage as she absorbed Isa's accusations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought that she had wronged the God of Night was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt as though Isa was blaming her for marrying Osborne, for becoming his wife, and for being "tainted".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not my fault! I've always loved him! I never loved Osborne&mdash;not once! That was just my past self being foolish. I've sealed her away now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night will surely forgive me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to let him see me!" Ophelia shouted, her voice rising in desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's eyes flickered with sadness. "Ophelia, you still don't see where you went wrong? You really... deserve this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go! You can't just walk away! If you don't tell me where the God of Night is, I won't let you leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's anxiety surged, and she lunged at Isa, trying to block her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Isa kicked Ophelia away, sending her crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia, stop clinging to this! My teacher owes you nothing! I've fulfilled my promise to you; it's you who made the mistake, you who wronged him! So just let it go and live your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling to her feet, Ophelia stared at Isa in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... how </span><span>can</span><span> you </span><span>be </span><span>so strong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be happening! I've regained my power from my past life and reached the peak of Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King! I'm so close to breaking through to Ascension Eight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you defeat me so easily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How old are you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This doesn't make sense! Your strength feels almost on par with his!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa merely smiled, "He's my teacher. It's only natural that my strength is similar to his. As for you... never mind. I don't want to waste more words on you. You're unaware of your own mistakes, but I'll show you mercy this once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to see him, if you want his forgiveness, then head to the border battlefield! Go help the God of Light and the Human Community! You might just encounter him there soon! And if you genuinely assist the Human Community in resisting the Paramount Supreme Clan, when he returns... he might consider forgiving you! That's all I have to say. Take care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa's figure melted into shadows and vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stood there, stunned. "Go to the border battlefield?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I might run into him there? Help the God of Light? Help the Human Community? Is this the only way to wait for his return? Will he really consider forgiving me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I... truly make a mistake?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I really wrong him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confusion and doubt clouded her eyes, but soon determination replaced it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at the imposing Sanctum of Night, gritting her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, I will go to the border battlefield! I will wait for his return! When that time comes, I will demand to know what I did wrong! I will find out how I wronged him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ophelia vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her target was set on the border battlefield!</span></p></div>
