        <h1>Chapter 946 Expanding Strength</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that, given their current strength, they wouldn't be able to withstand the next assault from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only way forward was to boost their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a surge of relief knowing that he possessed the Blood Cross, a powerful artifact capable of absorbing blood energy to enhance the strength of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without it, there was no way they could achieve such a rapid increase in power through conventional means.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, Osborne activated the Blood Cross, gathering every drop of blood left on the battlefield. In no time, he had amassed over five thousand drops of blood energy, a potent reservoir of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The toll of the battle had been heavy on both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draco Armed Services Branch had suffered over three hundred casualties, while </span><span>the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had lost more than a thousand clones, each one of them at least Class AA, with dozens of </span><span>Class</span><span> AAA among the fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even five Class S clones had met their end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood energy left behind was incredibly rich, especially when combined with the energy from the three Class S clones and over sixty Class AAA clones Osborne had previously dispatched. The sheer volume of blood energy was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each drop was packed with an intensity that could turn the tide of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne distributed the blood energy among every member of the Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the Blood Demon members began to absorb the energy, their strength surging rapidly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Class A+ Blood Demon members, after absorbing the blood energy, broke through to Class AA one after another. Meanwhile, those already at Class AA quickly pushed toward Class AAA, with many successfully shattering their previous limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the last drop was consumed, the power of the Blood Demon members had skyrocketed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All five thousand two hundred and nine members had reached Class AA, and the number of Class AAA members had surpassed five hundred!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon's strength expanded like an inflating balloon, far surpassing that of the Draco Armed Services Branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At their peak, the Draco Armed Services Branch had barely managed to muster two hundred Class AAA fighters, and now, with their losses, they were down to less than a hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, the Blood Demon's power now eclipsed the Draco Armed Services Branch by a factor of five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Blood Demon members stood united, a palpable aura of strength surrounded them, each one radiating the fierce determination of battle-hardened warriors, their eyes burning with intensity as they looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thrill coursed through Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he finally felt he had a formidable force at his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His confidence swelled, and Osborne was itching to lead the Blood Demon members straight into the heart of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' lair to uproot them once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly reined in that impulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Blood Demon organization was undeniably powerful now, the idea of completely dismantling the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was still far-fetched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were missing one critical element&mdash;their top-tier combatants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class S warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this war between the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> and the Draco Group, the true turning point rested on the shoulders of the Class S fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the Blood Demon's strength had surged, Gerardo's clones were equally formidable. If Gerardo managed to create dozens, or even hundreds, of Class S clones, they would pose a genuine threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, allowing himself to regain his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Now is not the time for a final showdown!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to take out more clones to siphon their blood energy and boost the Blood Demon's power. Ideally, I want every member of Blood Demon to break through to Class AAA&mdash;that's the only way we'll stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Gerardo is just too strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I'm going to take him down, I must reach Class S and also find Grandpa to heal his wounds. Only then will I have a fighting chance against Gerardo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With swift determination, Osborne mapped out his next moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa would need six more days to ascend to Class AAA. He resolved to make the most of that time, hunting down as many clones as possible to ensure all of Blood Demon could achieve that level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he'd dash back to the Augustine Estate and tap into Clarissa's fate power to break through to Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, he would have the strength to track down Sebastian. Once Osborne retrieved him and healed his injuries, they could launch a full-fledged counterattack against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, life had a way of throwing curveballs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dead of night, Osborne sensed a terrifying fluctuation in space above Campbell HQ.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his Satan's Eye flared to life, pulsating wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, a horrific attack surged forward. The very center of Campbell Headquarters collapsed into itself, reducing the area to absolute ruin, vanishing from existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in that section of the Draco Armed Services Branch&mdash;regardless of their strength&mdash;never stood a chance to escape. They were erased in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that the earth-shattering sound echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that a... Spatial Collapse?!" Osborne gasped, instinctively taking to the skies.</span></p></div>
