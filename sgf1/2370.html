        <h1>Chapter 2295 Straight to the Sixth Layer-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Chief Judge Rupert's signal, everyone took off like a shot, quickly crossing the rift and landing in the depths below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarcely anyone hung around on the first layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, snagging a token there was only worth one lousy point. It was peanuts. Everyone there was part of Zephyr State's top dogs, and each one of them could handle the first three layers of the Arctic Maw Chasm. Naturally, they were itching to go deeper and would only call it quits when they hit their limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding a token on the third layer was worth a cool hundred points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the fourth layer? A staggering thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding a token on the fourth layer was like striking gold compared to finding a thousand tokens on the first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a dumbbell would stick around on the first layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, almost everyone had made it to the third layer. That was when different paths started to diverge. The majority decided to camp out on the third layer and scattered like cockroaches to hunt for tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, around three to four hundred folks decided to take the plunge and go even deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only about two hundred people could move around freely on the fourth layer. But a good number of them could manage to stay for a few hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Clara, for instance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the state duel had just kicked off, Clara still had plenty of Sacred Power in the tank. Naturally, she was eager to start scouring the fourth layer. Once her Sacred Power was running on empty, she'd head back to the third layer to look for tokens while replenishing her energy at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she'd keep this cycle going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the first three days of the state duel, all the participants were forbidden from getting into fights or causing a ruckus. All they had to do was rack up as many tokens as they could and score as many points as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly four hundred people made their way into the fourth layer. Most of them split up like a pack of wild animals, each going their own way to hunt for tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly turned to Osborne and said, "Osborne, watch your back on the fifth layer! If you start to feel like you can't hack it, hightail it back to the fourth layer right away! Once you're here, give me a shout, and I'll hand over the tokens I've found for you to register!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned and nodded. "Roger that! You stay safe too. Don't go getting yourself kicked out of the duel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'm outta here! Keep me in the loop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Clara took off in a hurry. The fourth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm was a real maze. Even with hundreds of folks out there looking for tokens, it was like finding a needle in a haystack to bump into someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't waste any time. He zapped himself to the fifth layer, using the Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were far fewer people here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only around a hundred could move about freely on the fifth layer. Counting those who could last an hour or two, there were no more than two hundred in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, most of them had scattered like cockroaches when the lights came on, getting ready to hunt for tokens on the fifth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave's team was among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave decided not to head for the sixth layer. Given their team's strength, scouring the fifth layer for tokens was the smartest play. Most of them could stick it out for a good while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the sixth layer, it was a death trap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Gustave couldn't hold his own for long on the sixth layer. If he didn't hightail it out of there in time, he'd be history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, break a leg!" Gustave tossed that comment at Osborne before taking off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You too, buddy!" Osborne flashed a smile and bid farewell to Gustave and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of joining the crowd to hunt for tokens, he had other plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were set on the sixth layer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne wasn't in a rush to head down. He was playing the waiting game, letting Agatha, Horace, and the rest go first. Once he was certain the coast was clear, he'd fire up his Translocator and make his way to the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd noticed earlier that fewer than fifty people had ventured to the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of those, only around twenty had the chops to stay and operate for any real length of time.</span></p></div>
