        <h1>Chapter 801 Humiliating Cuthbert</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert moved forward step by step until he was standing right in front of Osborne, who still couldn't get up. Everyone around thought Osborne was done for. Cuthbert would definitely make him suffer and humiliate him. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Cuthbert was sure of it. Osborne had messed up his Honor Quest Ceremony, draining his energy for future victories. His hatred for Osborne was at its peak. There was no way he would let Osborne off easy. He wanted to make Osborne regret ever existing. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, Osborne suddenly moved. With a bloodied smile that looked more threatening than comforting, Osborne grinned. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert froze, confused. He thought, "In this state, he's smiling? Has he lost his mind?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne wasn't losing his mind. He had noticed the Powerstone on Cuthbert's chest had vanished, causing Cuthbert's steps to falter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment Osborne had been waiting for had arrived.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Slowly, Osborne raised his hand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Light of Redemption!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, a divine light descended from the heavens and enveloped Osborne. Under the glow of this redemptive light, his grievous injuries healed in the blink of an eye.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's bones had been nearly shattered by Cuthbert's blows, but now, they were completely restored.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mental strength, nearly depleted, was instantly revitalized.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash, Osborne's condition was back to its prime. If it weren't for the blood staining him, one might think he hadn't been through a brutal battle at all.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was at his peak!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stood up and looked at Cuthbert with a cold, disdainful smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert was stunned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The spectators, too, were frozen. Apart from the already prepared Emma, everyone was in shock, staring at Osborne with disbelief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They wondered, "Such severe injuries?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He healed just like that?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Such exhaustion?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he's back to full strength?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A collective gasp filled the air as they saw Osborne return to his prime.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They looked at Cuthbert with pity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear to everyone that Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony was over.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his current state, anyone could defeat him with ease.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Osborne, now back at his best, wasn't about to give Cuthbert any chances.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ignoring Cuthbert's dazed state, Osborne moved with lightning speed and landed a crushing kick to Cuthbert's chest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Cuthbert had been at his peak, this attack would have been inconsequential. He could have easily blocked or dodged it without any harm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, Cuthbert had no chance to evade or defend.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's kick sent Cuthbert flying through the air, blood spraying wildly. His ribs shattered with sharp, cracking sounds, the intense pain forcing him into a low, pained scream.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert crashed heavily onto the arena floor, his face twisted in agony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before he could recover, Osborne was already standing over him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked down at Cuthbert with a cold sneer. "Cuthbert, I told you I'd end your Honor Quest Ceremony with my own hands. Now, I've done it! Weren't you so arrogant when you humiliated Rhett?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And when you injured my sister, weren't you full of yourself?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, I'm here to avenge them!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne delivered another powerful kick to Cuthbert's chest, sending him flying once more, blood spraying in his wake as he crashed heavily down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The impact shattered even more of Cuthbert's bones.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne wasn't done yet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression remained icy as he unleashed a flurry of kicks on Cuthbert, his movements so swift that the spectators barely had time to react before Cuthbert was reduced to a battered mess.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop it!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson family erupted in outrage; their faces twisted with fury as they watched Osborne's relentless assault.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They looked on in horror at Cuthbert's pitiful state, trembling with anger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert had lost!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He'd been defeated in his fifty challenge, falling short of the fifty consecutive victories he was supposed to achieve.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson family had placed immense confidence in him, believing Cuthbert could easily achieve eighty or even ninety consecutive wins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had even entertained the notion of him reaching a hundred, given the right luck.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, Cuthbert hadn't even reached fifty consecutive wins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For the Williamson family, this was an unforgivable blow, a mark of shame.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What stung even more was Osborne's refusal to stop despite their desperate pleas. He continued his assault, even stepping on Cuthbert's head with a cold smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stared at the enraged members of the Williamson family. "He hasn't conceded yet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should I stop?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He did the same to Rhett before! Did he stop, then?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should I back off now that it's my turn to humiliate him?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a sneer, Osborne pressed down harder with his foot.</p></div>
