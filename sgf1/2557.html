        <h1>Chapter 2456 Notary-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, only the chief referee Gerald and the others were suitable to act as witnesses for their bet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda, if you don't give it to me then, I'll take it by force!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne decided to invite the chief referee Gerald and the others to be his witnesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a dignified voice suddenly rang out. "How about I act as the notary for this bet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, everyone felt their eyes blur. Not far from them, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man exuded a unique aura of nobility. Although he didn&rsquo;t deliberately act arrogant, everyone instinctively felt that he held a distinguished status.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this middle-aged man, most people looked confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, the chief referee Gerald and the others in the distance immediately stood up and bowed respectfully to the middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"General Ian Augustine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"General Ian Augustine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian casually waved his hand. Looking at Brenda and Osborne, he said calmly, "Let me introduce myself. My name is Ian Augustine, a three-star general of the Glorious Divine Kingdom and a branch bloodline of the royal Augustine family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With my status, being the notary for your bet should be enough, right? I guarantee that no one would dare to go back on their word, no matter the outcome."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Ian's face showed a confident expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, all the contestants present were stunned, staring at him in utter shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's General Ian Augustine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's a warrior who has reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's also a member of the royal family!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A three-star general!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why is he here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people looked at Ian and whispered among themselves, their eyes filled with respect and admiration, which made Ian very satisfied. These contestants were outstanding talents with bright futures, yet they still showed him such respect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was brought to Ian by his royal status.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Brenda was looking at him respectfully at this moment. In Skyearth Dominion, there were naturally many warriors who had reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, and Brenda's master was one of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leader of Skyearth Dominion was even a warrior who had reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, among the warriors who had reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, Ian's status was far more distinguished because he was a three-star general of the Glorious Divine Kingdom and a member of the royal family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Brenda respectfully bowed, not daring to show the slightest neglect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Ian looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He originally thought Osborne's face would show respect, or even admiration, flattery, or ingratiation. After all, Osborne was merely a disciple of a Second-rate Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing a warrior like Ian, who had both strength and status, how could Osborne not try his best to please him? As long as Osborne could gain Ian's favor, his fate would change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne was not as respectful as he had imagined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at Ian, his expression complicated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Ian feel strange, but he didn&rsquo;t think much of it, just assuming Osborne was naturally odd, a weirdo.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, if Osborne wasn&rsquo;t a weirdo, how could he have entered such a losing bet with Brenda? Did Osborne really think Brenda couldn&rsquo;t make it to the top three?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian even found it laughable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You two proposed this bet. As a warrior, since you&rsquo;ve said it, there&rsquo;s no backing out. Now, I&rsquo;ll be the witness and see who among you will be the winner!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Cosmic Translocator still needs some time to be repaired. We&rsquo;ll use this time to tally your achievements and rank you to determine the results of this zone duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Ian finished speaking, everyone nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'd better do that!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chief Judge Gerald said, "This way, we won't have to wait until we return to the Racial Convergence Planet to tally the results. I will project the statistics back so everyone can witness it together..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian nodded after hearing this. "Alright. Let's begin!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, line up and submit your achievements to me. I will convert your achievements into Kingdom Duel Scorepoints based on the exchange ratio on the list!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who&rsquo;s first?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Ian finished speaking, someone immediately stepped forward eagerly. "I'll go first!"</span></p></div>
