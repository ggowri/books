        <h1>Chapter 2613 Leaving the Treasury-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne ultimately decided to exchange for Sacred Turtle Mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Sacred Turtle Mountain can be regarded as both an offensive Sacred Artifact and a defensive Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its attack method is throwing it to smash the enemy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sacred Turtle Mountain itself is incredibly heavy. Once activated, it can be thrown. The massive mountain falling down would cause even warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection or Great Perfection to panic and flee.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, if hit, ordinary Defensive Sacred Artifacts won't be able to withstand it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sacred Turtle Mountain can easily shatter a small planet into pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, he can not only use Sacred Turtle Mountain to smash people but also infuse it with power. The stronger the infused power, the heavier Sacred Turtle Mountain becomes, and the faster it smashes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, this method is straightforward and brutal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those hit either block it if they can, or if not, they'll be smashed into pulp, leaving hardly any remains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only that, Sacred Turtle Mountain is extremely massive and sturdy, serving as a natural barrier when placed in front. It's incredibly difficult for ordinary people to break through, let alone shatter it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This simple and brutal method of attack and defense is astonishing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the price is as high as 30 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, Osborne has no better choice. He finally decides to keep this Sacred Turtle Mountain. When facing an unbeatable expert, he can simply throw it to crush the opponent to death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The only drawback of Sacred Turtle Mountain might be its excessive consumption of Sacred Power. Activating it requires a huge amount of Sacred Power, and if I want to control its direction afterward, it will drain a large amount of Sacred Power every second."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ordinary people indeed find it hard to control, as even slight use would deplete their Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps this is precisely why the Sacred Turtle Mountain, despite its immense power, has remained in the Royal Treasury and was never taken by any Royal Family member."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and put away the Sacred Turtle Mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For him, the drawback of Sacred Turtle Mountain consuming Sacred Power is completely negligible. After all, his Sacred Power will never run out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For him, as long as he can activate the Sacred Turtle Mountain, nothing else matters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Sacred Turtle Mountain will become another of my ultimate moves!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he continued searching for his target.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After redeeming the Sacred Turtle Mountain, Osborne's Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were almost depleted, leaving only nine billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nine billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can be exchanged for a slightly better Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne already had a clear goal. "Dragon Binding Rope exchange price: nine billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne approached a rope. It looked ordinary but emitted an extremely powerful Sacred Artifact aura, being a rather formidable Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its function is also very simple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone bound by it will have their strength suppressed, making it hard to break free.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This ability is similar to Clara's Dominating Coil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had long wanted Clara's Dominating Coil. However, her family-inherited battle skill was something he couldn't learn. Although he had many ways to kill opponents, capturing them alive wasn't easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, the Dragon Binding Rope perfectly makes up for this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only problem is that after using the Dragon Binding Rope to bind an enemy, one must continuously inject power to prevent them from breaking free. For those without deep or strong Sacred Power, merely restraining the enemy for a short time could deplete their own Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne has no concerns about depleting Sacred Power.</span></p></div>
