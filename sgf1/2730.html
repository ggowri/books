        <h1>Chapter 2600 Result</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Seraphina revealed her trump card&mdash;fusion of four types of power, Osborne chose not to reveal his.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want anyone to know that he had also fused four types of power, or even more, before reaching Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He can fuse six in total!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this situation, he could only rely on the Sacred Power fused from three types of forces to defeat Seraphina and severely injure her, making her unable to participate in the upcoming top-five ranking battle. The only way was to use Heaven Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of Heaven Arrow far surpasses Earth Arrow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was Osborne's strongest attack. Even with Sacred Power fused from only three types of forces, Osborne was confident he could defeat Seraphina and severely injure her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only trouble is...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced at the other person on the stage, their referee&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro is an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne's attack could truly severely injure Seraphina, Zorro would definitely step in promptly to save her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that case, although Osborne won, he wouldn't be able to severely injure Seraphina, and she could still participate in the upcoming top-five ranking battles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With her strength, neither Clara nor Leroy is her match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, Seraphina will secure second place!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's plan to dominate the top three and completely disgrace the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom wouldn't be flawless and would have imperfections!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I must severely injure Seraphina quickly before Zorro reacts! If that's the case..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold glint flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina's seventh Twinkling Star Arrow had reached an incredibly terrifying level, and she was almost ready to launch her attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne no longer hesitated and drew the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Bloodwrought Bow might only be a Superior Sacred Artifact and ranked much lower than the Blackstar Bow, but it was a perfect match for Osborne. It synced flawlessly with both him and the Solar Sacred Arrow&mdash;like an extension of his own body. Their bond had reached an extraordinary level of harmony.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, in his hands, the Bloodwrought Bow's power was no less than that of a Legendary Sacred Artifact. Even if someone offered a Supreme Sacred Artifact in exchange for the Bloodwrought Bow, Osborne would never trade it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's settle this with one arrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Heaven Arrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Heaven Arrow has only one move because it consumes too much energy. Every time Osborne uses it, he needs a half-hour cooldown time before he can use it again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, with tenfold Time Acceleration, Osborne can actually use it once every three minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is Osborne's ultimate trump card, his strongest attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the brilliant Sacred Power Arrow gathered on the Bloodwrought Bow, aiming at Seraphina from afar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's Twinkling Star Arrow, the seventh shot, was also aimed at Osborne at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Killing intent erupted between the two.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Under Empyrean Sacredness, I am invincible! This arrow will surely severely wound you! No matter what tricks you have left, you will fall by my hand!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twinkling Star Arrow, Seventh Shot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twinkle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina unleashed her strongest attack, the terrifying arrow shot out, and countless cracks instantly appeared on the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This arena, having endured hundreds or even thousands of Glorious Divine Kingdom Duels before, had never cracked&mdash;until now, it cracked!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Along the path of the Twinkling Star Arrow, massive cracks appeared on the arena, and the newly set-up defensive shield began to tremble violently again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's arrow was truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the spectators, many were Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors. They couldn't help but look grave, as the power of this arrow was not much weaker than their own attacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was an arrow with power comparable to an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior's attack!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Who beneath Empyrean Sacredness could withstand this arrow?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Probably no one!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least on Racial Convergence Planet, there should be none!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people had this thought in their hearts at this moment; they all believed Osborne was already defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne's Heaven Arrow was also unleashed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Heaven Arrow was unleashed, the world trembled, and dense cracks appeared on the arena beneath Osborne's feet. Then, at an astonishing speed, it rushed toward Seraphina's Twinkling Star Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, a massive explosion erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying explosive force once again engulfed the entire arena. The protective shield was now on the verge of collapse, seemingly ready to shatter at any moment. Meanwhile, the arena beneath their feet had completely crumbled and split apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The arena was completely shattered!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The arena, which had remained unshakable for tens of thousands of years and thousands of Glorious Divine Kingdom Duels, was unexpectedly shattered this time by the power of Osborne and Seraphina during the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, dust billowed, and power surged wildly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The view was completely obscured, and everyone grew curious again about who would claim victory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Zorro, the referee on the arena, suddenly had a change in expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not good! Stop!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Zorro suddenly vanished from his spot and rushed into the dust, striking out with a fierce palm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a loud bang, everything settled down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the dust cleared. At this moment, Zorro stood on the ruins of the arena with an extremely grim expression, while at the edge of the ruins, Osborne lay on the ground clutching his chest, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne is injured!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like Osborne lost after all! It's understandable, though&mdash;who would have thought Princess Seraphina had already fused four powers before reaching Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who could stop that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne being able to fight Princess Seraphina to this extent is already impressive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if he lost, he can still be proud!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly! Unfortunately, the ultimate dark horse still couldn't defeat the top favorite for the championship! The Royal Family of Glorious Divine Kingdom managed to keep the title in the end..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such a pity..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd was talking when they suddenly saw Osborne grinning, looking very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While everyone was stunned and wondering why Osborne was smiling despite losing, the dust continued to clear, revealing more of the arena's ruins.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, everyone was stunned, their faces filled with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the middle of the arena's ruins, a figure lay collapsed amidst the debris, covered in blood and unconscious. A Supreme Sacred Artifact bow had fallen beside her...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most important thing, however, was...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The figure's two legs had also fallen beside her!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was Seraphina!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's condition was far more tragic than Osborne's. Not only had both her legs been severed at the root, but there were also two gruesome wounds on her chest and face...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face was pale, and the overwhelming severity of her injuries left her unconscious without even a single scream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone fell silent!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene was utterly silent!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who previously thought Osborne would lose the match were now wide-eyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What exactly happened in that moment?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why were Seraphina's injuries so severe? Even her legs were completely severed?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why was Osborne injured too?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why...?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Zorro spoke grimly, "Young man, why did you strike so heavily? Your Sacred Power Arrow had already defeated her! Why did you still use spatial power to attack Princess Seraphina up close, causing such severe injuries to her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just told you to stop, why didn't you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why did you still sever her legs?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Zorro was extremely furious, and as he finished speaking, everyone suddenly understood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all looked at Osborne, faces full of shock.</span></p></div>
