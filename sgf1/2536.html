        <h1>Chapter 2437 Drum</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Daddy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne froze, staring in disbelief at the fist-sized bug on his shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Was it you talking?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes. Daddy, you finally showed up. Can you take me out to play?" That cute voice sounded again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was startled. "Don't talk nonsense. I'm not your daddy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne felt a bit strange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Is this peculiar bug really Empress Kira's child? It looks so strange, even a bit too ugly. It has eight legs, six eyes, dozens of wings, a horn, and sharp mandibles. It's practically like a monster bug.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But why does it call me daddy? We don't look alike at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne looked at the peculiar bug again and suddenly noticed a mist-like substance gathering in its six eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed to be crying!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A voice sounded again. "Daddy, do you think I'm ugly? Are you saying I'm a monster? Daddy, don't you like me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was startled</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Can this bug hear my thoughts? This is ridiculous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Osborne was about to explain, a cold snort suddenly echoed in his mind, like thunder striking his brain, leaving him dizzy. Massive waves surged in his Soul Current Ocean, almost causing him to collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An angry voice rang out. "The prejudice in the hearts of lower beings is like a mountain. You actually think my child is ugly, a monster? In the eyes of the Bug Clan, your Spirit Clan is also very ugly. How dare you call my child ugly? You're courting death. My child is the most perfect being in this world."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne felt his body become immobile again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, the translucent drum nearby began to tremble slowly. Then, a terrifying force pressed down on Osborne, making him feel the breath of death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was extremely panicked, thinking, "As expected, Empress Kira's consciousness hasn't completely vanished. Her consciousness is still in this drum. Does she want to kill me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, that sweet voice rang out again. "Mom, don't scare Dad. Dad means no harm. If you hurt Dad, no one will take me out to play, and no one will give me tasty food. Then I'll never grow up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne felt the drum stop vibrating, and the sense of death quickly dissipated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne's back was already completely soaked. He looked at the Drum of Empress Kira, feeling utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Empress Kira's voice rang out again. "Human, if it weren't for my child choosing you, just for thinking she's ugly, I would kill you a hundred times and utterly destroy you in the most brutal way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But now, I will spare your life. You better take good care of my child. If she suffers any grievance, you will surely die. Remember, my child is not ugly. She will change because of you in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you are kind, she will become kind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you are cruel, she will become cruel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you are merciful, she will become merciful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you are evil, she will become evil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you are domineering, she will become domineering too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you are weak, she will become weak too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You better take good care of her. If I wake up next time and find her wronged, you're dead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empress Kira's voice grew weaker and weaker. By the time she spoke the last sentence, her voice was almost inaudible. Then, there was no sound anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the moment her voice disappeared, the translucent drum turned into a stream of light and entered Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly checked his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he found the shrunken Drum of Empress Kira in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The drum was still translucent, soaked in the blood of his heart. With each heartbeat, its surface gently pulsed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne felt his heartbeat seemed stronger. Osborne even thought it wasn't a heartbeat but the sound of a drum being struck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned, thinking, "The Drum of Empress Kira actually entered my body and hid inside my heart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He tried to control the Drum of Empress Kira, attempting to get it out of his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he couldn't do it at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, don't worry. My mom won't hurt you. Inside your body, she'll just gradually change you, making you stronger. My mom is tired. She needs to rest now." That sweet voice sounded again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at the bug on his shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt utterly confused, thinking, "What on earth is going on? Why did Empress Kira's child choose me? Why does Empress Kira's child see me as its dad?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could feel the closeness of this peculiar bug, and this peculiar bug could even hear his thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could also hear its thoughts because this peculiar bug had never opened its mouth; all the sounds it made were its thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shaking his head, Osborne tried to calm down and quickly analyze the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, Osborne realized he couldn't figure anything out and thought it might be better to just ask the bug on his shoulder directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he directly asked, "What's your name?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That adorable voice sounded again. "Daddy, Mommy said my name needs to be chosen by you. So, I don't have a name yet. Daddy, can you give me a name now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned, thinking, "It seems this little one has decided I'm its dad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne stopped hesitating because he was worried Empress Kira might kill him outright.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Do you really want me to give you a name?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes. Daddy, you must give me a nice name." At this moment, all six eyes of the peculiar bug revealed a look of anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and said, "How about calling you Drum?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum?" The peculiar bug tilted her head, seemingly pondering. Then, she happily said, "I finally have a name. It's the name Daddy gave me. I'm called Drum!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Drum's dozens of wings were fluttering joyfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was also influenced by Drum's emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He found that Drum's mind was very simple, just like a real child. Drum would be happy because of the name he gave her and sad because he thought she was ugly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Drum's appearance was quite peculiar, they belonged to different species with different aesthetics. This had nothing to do with beauty or ugliness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the eyes of the Bug Clan, humans were also very ugly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Drum doesn't think I'm ugly. How can I think Drum is ugly? This is indeed my fault.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling deeply guilty, he looked at Drum, his eyes full of apology.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Drum's comforting voice sounded. "Dad, you don't need to apologize to me. I know what's going on. I won't blame you, and I won't think you're ugly. I never will."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed out loud, then couldn't wait to ask, "Drum, why did you choose me? Why do you think I'm your dad?"</span></p></div>
