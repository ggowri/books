        <h1>Chapter 2681 Testing</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana quickly put on her clothes to prevent Osborne's hands from wandering on her, making it impossible for her to stay serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her expression returned to coldness and seriousness, as if the powerful and capable Adriana was back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana asked, "Osborne, are you suspecting there's something wrong with May?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "She's definitely suspicious. Not just May, I suspect everyone who entered the jungle is in trouble. I saw them get pierced in vital spots by branches. Even if they didn't die on the spot, they must be seriously injured."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They were dragged into the eerie depths of the jungle by the branches, so I couldn't see them. But why would the jungle's controller let them go after taking control of them? And why didn't May mention such a serious matter after coming out?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana nodded. "Your suspicion does make sense. What do you think is wrong with May? She's still perfectly fine now, her life and powers are no different from before. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to enter Fairy Moon Sect."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne began to think and shook his head, saying, "I don't know what's wrong with her. But I believe if we can restrain May, question her properly, or even press her, we'll naturally get the answer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana frowned and said, "Restrain her? No way! May is one of the leaders of Fairy Moon Sect and also my elder. She's the person my parents trust the most. In fact, May raised me. Without evidence, I can't treat her like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Then let's test her first. Once we have evidence, we'll act."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Adriana didn't refuse. "Alright, I'll test her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana and Osborne left the room and arrived at a crystal-clear grand hall. This was the meeting hall of Fairy Moon Sect, also where Adriana usually handled the sect's affairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the supreme leader of Fairy Moon Sect, Adriana sat on a massive Frostshard Sovereign Throne, while Osborne stood beside her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, May, following Adriana's orders, appeared in the grand hall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana asked, "May, how many of our Elders have returned?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At first, Adriana was simply discussing Fairy Moon Sect matters with May as usual. May showed no signs of anything unusual and handled everything perfectly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Adriana a bit suspicious, thinking, "May seems so normal. Does she really have a problem? I don't think so."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May now seemed no different from before, but Adriana couldn't ignore Osborne's words. So, to find out if May truly had a problem, she had to keep testing her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Adriana said, "May, it's all thanks to you; otherwise, I wouldn't be able to handle so many tedious matters of the Fairy Moon Sect."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May smiled and said, "Ms. Alba, you're too kind. This is what I should do. Besides, it was your father who saved me back then and gave me a second chance at life. Even though he's no longer here, he told me to take good care of you and assist you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, your strength has far surpassed mine. I can only help you with trivial matters and can't assist you with real big issues. I'm old."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing May's words, Adriana felt even more that May couldn't possibly have a problem, as only May could say such things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Adriana continued, "May, now that everything is settled, let's talk about the situation with the Skyfall Casket. After entering the Skyfall Casket, we got separated. I still don't know what you went through during that month in the Skyfall Casket. Tell me in detail. I'm really curious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May smiled and nodded, saying, "Alright. Ms. Alba, since you want to know, I certainly won't hide it from you. Actually, my experience was quite simple. At first, I was trapped in a safe zone, and then..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled and recounted her thirty-day experience in the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing May's words, Osborne became very serious, thinking, "May lied."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her account, she was either hiding in the safe zone of the Ancient Battlefield or killing astral projections. She spent thirty days like this until the Skyfall Casket closed, and she was teleported away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't mention anything about that eerie forest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in Osborne's view, she was deliberately hiding something, which was a sign of her guilt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana also sensed something was off, thinking, "Osborne said May entered an eerie forest and then something happened. But May's account didn't mention that forest at all. So, one of them must be lying. Who could it be?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was very conflicted at this moment. If it were before, she would have been more inclined to believe May. After all, she knew May better. May had even raised her, so she absolutely trusted May.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, she had already been with Osborne. Whether she wanted to admit it or not, Osborne was already her man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana didn&rsquo;t want to doubt the man she chose, nor did she want to doubt May.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Adriana gritted her teeth and said, "May, is this all you experienced at Skyfall Casket? Didn't you come across an eerie forest? I heard someone say that an eerie forest appeared on the Ancient Battlefield, and many emperor fruits flew out on their own. Everyone present got one. Didn't you get one?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana stared intently at May.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, May's expression changed. Then she said, "I haven't heard about this. How could such a thing happen? There's not even a blade of grass on that Ancient Battlefield, so how could a forest appear? And a forest with many emperor fruits? That's simply impossible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May directly denied it, but the instant change in her expression was already caught by Osborne and Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana bit her lower lip, feeling a bit uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She grew more suspicious of May, so she directly said, "May, you're lying because I can feel the energy of emperor fruit on you. You've obtained some emperor fruits. Are you unwilling to tell me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, May was stunned. "Impossible. Those emperor fruits..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, she seemed to realize something and then said, "Ms. Alba, I really haven't obtained any emperor fruit. The emperor fruit energy on me might have come from someone else."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, if you don't believe me, you can search me. If I really had obtained some emperor fruits, how could I not tell you? I'm already old, so improving my strength doesn't mean much to me anymore. If I had some emperor fruits, I would definitely hand them over to you to use."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May sighed immediately, but Adriana's expression grew even colder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne said, "May, you're lying. You indeed don't have any emperor fruit on you, but you did obtain them before. Not only did you get them, but you also entered that eerie forest. Along with you were over thirty warriors at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I saw you all go in with my own eyes. Moreover, I saw you desperately trying to escape that forest in terror. But in the end, you were blocked by nets made of branches, your vital points pierced by them, and then dragged into the depths of the eerie forest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, why are you lying? Who are you really? Are you still May?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, May's expression changed instantly. She glared at Osborne with a somewhat twisted look. "You're talking nonsense!"</span></p></div>
