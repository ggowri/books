        <h1>Chapter 2557 Improvement</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were extremely excited at this moment because their gains were tremendous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Osborne said he would help them achieve a qualitative leap in strength within ten days, making them the supreme powers in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. They didn't believe it at all because it seemed too difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy thought at the time, "In just ten days, we definitely can't make significant progress. For most people at our cultivation level, it's impossible to improve strength so quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, they believed Osborne's words!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The effect of the Top-grade Dragon Elixir was simply incredible. That marvelous Enlightenment State brought them gains far greater than hundreds of years of prior cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy's cultivation level was still Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, but their strength had greatly improved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they fought their ten-day-ago selves now, they might win with just one move!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This feeling was truly amazing. At this moment, Clara and Leroy were incredibly excited, eager for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel to begin so they could test their current strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "We'll talk about other things later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Time is running out. We need to hurry to the Empire Hotel to meet the other contestants, then enter the Royal Sepulcher and wait for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel to begin."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne understood Clara and Leroy's excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his perception, their aura was much stronger than ten days ago. A hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir had completely transformed them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Clara and Leroy took a deep breath and calmed down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They suddenly realized that even though their strength had greatly improved, Osborne still seemed so mysterious to them, like an abyss with no end in sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In front of Osborne, their current strength still seemed so insignificant!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy exchanged glances and restrained their pride.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They said, "We need to change clothes!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Alright, I need to change clothes too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked into the room, preparing to use his power to isolate the space so they could change clothes separately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, he noticed Clara and Leroy had already started changing clothes directly. Their sexy figures were exposed right in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shyly turned his head away quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, all three had changed their clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were wearing light purple battle robes with the emblem of Eastern Zone 3 on them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This battle robe was prepared for the top ten by senior officials of Eastern Zone 3 during the send-off ceremony after the zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wearing this battle robe, they represented Eastern Zone 3.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne wasn't wearing Eastern Zone 3's battle robe; instead, he wore a pure black battle robe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy looked at him in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They asked, "Osborne, why aren't you wearing Eastern Zone 3's battle robe?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne heard this but didn't explain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason he didn't wear the Eastern Zone 3 battle robe was that his main purpose for coming here wasn't to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel but to pay respects to Michelle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want to wear the Eastern Zone 3 battle robe to pay respects to Michelle, but Osborne couldn't explain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne visiting Michelle's grave was risky. If someone discovered it, his identity might be exposed, causing a lot of trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want to tell Clara and Leroy about this because he didn't want to involve them in it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He changed the subject and said, "Let's go! We'll head to Empire Hotel first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy exchanged glances and didn't press further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne took out his Kingdom Duel Badge and said, "I'll return your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne transferred 4 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to both Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, that's too much!" Clara and Leroy quickly said upon seeing this, "Our Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were only 3 billion! You gave us nearly an extra billion."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, "It's fine. Just keep it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he walked forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy exchanged glances, then looked helplessly at Osborne's back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This domineering guy is really unbearable." Clara and Leroy both laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were almost used to being forcibly cared for by Osborne. Since Osborne would never take things back, they could only accept it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three walked toward the nearby Empire Hotel. In front of the Empire Hotel, Clara and Leroy curiously looked at the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leaderboard!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quick, see what position they ranked Osborne this time?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy quickly started searching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had already checked the leaderboard but didn't rush them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Clara and Leroy both showed surprised expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The top nine are all princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom? Princess Seraphina is ranked first? Everyone else can only compete for the tenth spot?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy felt a bit unconvinced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible! Osborne must be in the top ten. You're stronger than all of them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just smiled and said, "This isn't the final leaderboard. Don't worry about it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy nodded and kept searching further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, they saw Brenda's name at the 25th spot. Clara and Leroy both showed disdainful expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they finally saw Osborne at the 28th spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne is 28th!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it. They actually ranked you, Osborne, so far back. You have to show them how amazing you are!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded without saying a word.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy kept looking down, obviously searching for their own names.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, "You can just look at the very end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy paused for a moment, then quickly looked to the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then they both showed angry expressions. "Damn it, they actually ranked us tied at 108th. There are only 109 participants in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. That means the two of us are the weakest among all the contestants."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! So infuriating!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They actually ranked us last. When the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel begins, I'll make them regret looking down on us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara were both very angry at this moment, and their fighting spirit grew even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is just a small episode.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three quickly arrived at the entrance of Empire Hotel. Clara and Leroy easily walked in because they were wearing Eastern Zone 3 battle robes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, however, was stopped by two soldiers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Show your ID!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and took out the Kingdom Duel Badge, hanging it on his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The soldiers let Osborne pass after confirming that the Kingdom Duel Badge was authentic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne put away the Kingdom Duel Badge and walked in with Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, all the contestants in the Empire Hotel had gathered in the lobby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They gathered in their battle robes, staring at others around them, full of fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne and his group walked in, they immediately drew everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda was among the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she saw Osborne enter, she showed a look of anger and hatred. "Osborne!"</span></p></div>
