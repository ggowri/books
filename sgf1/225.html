        <h1>Chapter 225 Dimensional Collapse</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The brilliant yellow of level three Devil's Light wrapped around Osborne, resembling a shimmering suit of golden armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift thought, he unleashed the light, drawing in the elemental forces of water, wind, lightning, and earth around him, causing an explosive expansion that grew rapidly outwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a sphere of light emerged, shining like a miniature sun. This sphere then elongated into a magnificent sword of pure light, which he swung fiercely towards the oncoming dimensional rift that threatened to devour him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous crash, the light sword collided with the rift, generating an explosion akin to a meteor striking the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash sent shockwaves through the air, both the sword and the rift vibrating violently, as if they might shatter under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The environment around them fell into chaos, crumbling under the weight of the unleashed energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, both the light sword and the dimensional rift exploded in a blinding flash, dissolving into the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face lit up with surprising delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The level three Devil's Light hadn't disappointed him; it had stood against Orion's dimensional rift and matched it blow for blow, resulting in mutual annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no small feat, considering Orion was a Class B+ metahuman, while Osborne was only Class C+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gulf between them should have spelled doom for him. Moreover, Orion was someone wielding the fearsome powers of space manipulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the strength of the level three Devil's Light had leveled the playing field, allowing him to push back with equal might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization filled him with exhilaration; he hadn't expected to wield such power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, even Godfather didn't possess it. This assured Osborne to take on foes who were beyond his usual level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Orion's expression morphed into one of disbelief and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this happen?!" Orion exclaimed, watching helplessly as his revered dimensional rift fell apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The confidence that had once reigned in his demeanor dissipated, replaced by a menacing aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two kinds of power?" Orion growled, a twist of suspicion settling in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but think that Osborne was wielding not one but two powers&mdash;the lightning he'd seen earlier and the strange yellow glow now manifesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dual wielder was a rare kind of genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His murderous intent sharpened; Osborne wasn't even a Class B metahuman, yet here he was, presenting a serious threat with his combined powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion realized he couldn't let Osborne grow any stronger. If he did, Osborne would eventually become an insurmountable adversary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smirked, an air of confidence surrounding him. "Two powers? Maybe. What else have you got? Show me what you've got."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion inhaled deeply, his cold voice dripping with disdain. "Fine. I'll acknowledge your skill; you've impressed me. But don't think that just because you've survived this far means you can stand up to me. You've pushed me to use my ultimate move, and now, I'm going to make you wish you hadn't! Dimensional Collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, his words bearing the weight of the world. The space around them trembled violently as rifts began tearing through reality, one after the other, like gaping wounds to hell itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eighteen massive rifts, each measuring a solid 30 feet in length, surrounded Osborne, closing in from every direction as if forming a deadly battalion armed to swallow him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scattered around them were nearly a hundred smaller rifts, writhing like serpents eager to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scowled; the air had shattered around him, reflecting chaos like a mirror splintered into a thousand shards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A collapse of space, huh? Just what I'd expect from a Class B+ metahuman! I suppose this is Orion's ace in the hole. If I can just break this move, he'll be out of options."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's face had turned an unhealthy shade of pale. Controlling that many rifts was evidently taking its toll on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, through that strain, Orion's confidence remained intact as he sneered. "Now, I'm sending you straight to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Orion took a confident step forward into one of the small dimensional rifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was struck with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What the hell is he doing? Is he trying to off himself by jumping into a rift?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Satan's Eye began to pulsate wildly. He felt an overwhelming sense of danger creeping up from behind him. Without a second thought, Osborne lunged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late. A tremendous force slammed into his back, sending him hurtling across the battlefield. He felt a sharp chill race through him as his face paled; the golden, radiant armor of light that surrounded him flickered precariously, threatening to shatter under the assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whipping around, he saw Orion emerging from another dimensional rift behind him. It was Orion who had just attacked Osborne from behind, his fist imbued with the terrifying power of space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Come on, give me your best shot!" Orion taunted, a cruel smirk plastered across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he vanished back into the rift, only to reappear once again behind Osborne from yet another rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne barely had time to react as he was sent flying once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the protective shield of the golden armor, the sheer force of each blow drained him, leaving his complexion increasingly drawn and his body screaming in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion was relentless, slipping in and out of the dimensional rifts like a ghost, making it impossible for Osborne to predict where the next attack would come from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt like a deer in headlights&mdash;completely at the mercy of his unpredictable adversary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each brutal strike, the gravity of the situation escalated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the while, the eighteen colossal dimensional rifts began to close in, merging together into something far more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An ominous pull emanated from the jarring fusion, a force so potent it sent shivers down Osborne's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creeping sensation of utter dread gripped his heart.</span></p></div>
