        <h1>Chapter 2570 Provocation-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the contestants around Osborne all showed expressions of excitement and enthusiasm, as it was finally their turn to take the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, they were merely side characters in this Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony, stuck in the farthest corners of the square, completely unnoticed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This inevitably made them feel a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, those who stood out in the zone duel to participate in this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel were highly regarded in their respective regions, states, and cities. Everyone who saw them would praise them as a prodigy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all felt proud and confident in themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony, they became the most unnoticed side characters. No one cared about them, and no one paid attention to them. How could they not feel disappointed?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, with the start of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and the appearance of that massive arena, they can finally showcase themselves in front of all the big figures and return to the center stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as they perform well enough in the arena, they might even gain Frederick's favor and join Frederick's private guard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, there have been such precedents before. By then, they will be surrounded by glory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get ready," Justina said calmly. "You need to showcase your strength as much as possible in the arena. Even if you can't catch Emperor Frederick's attention and join his private guard, being noticed by other princes or princesses would still be good for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Justina gave Mason a cold glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long ago, Mason was brought back. His face was swollen, clearly showing he'd been severely punished. At this moment, as he felt Justina's gaze, his body trembled instantly. Then, he quickly looked away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he looked at Osborne with hatred in his eyes, thinking, "It's all because of that damn Osborne. If it weren't for him, Justina wouldn't have had me punished. I did nothing wrong. It's all because of Osborne."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason swore in his heart, his face full of hatred and anger, "Just wait! If I meet you in the arena, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll make sure to beat you up in front of Emperor Frederick, Queen Callista, and all the other princes, princesses, and big shots, so you</span><span>'</span><span>ll be utterly humiliated."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda beside him also stared coldly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the zone duel, she had thought she could easily win the championship. But in the end, because of Osborne, she was knocked out of the top three and lost the Legendary Sacred Artifact Ice Scepter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her hatred for Osborne was even deeper than Mason's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda murmured softly, her eyes filled with hatred, "Osborne, this time, I will take back everything I lost at the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. I will make everyone know that I am the most powerful young person in Eastern Zone 3, the strongest among those in Eastern Zone 3 whose cultivation level does not exceed Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You won the championship in the zone duel just because you were lucky. In terms of strength, I should have been the champion. This Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel uses the most direct and straightforward arena battles. This time, luck won't help you&mdash;only strength will decide the outcome."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, nine young men and women in battle robes slowly walked out from the members of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These nine were the princes and princesses participating in this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. They dominated the top nine spots on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone believed their strength far surpassed the other contestants, even thinking they would dominate the top nine spots in the final results.</span></p></div>
