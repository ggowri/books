        <h1>Chapter 1036 Gerardo Is Coming</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was willing to join the Augustine family and fight against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> together with the Augustine family. He&rsquo;s very welcomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Bryce was a Class S warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they lacked most were Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important thing was that Bryce was a genius. Although his current strength was not too strong, he would eventually grow up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the future, as long as Bryce did not die, he could at least reach the top of Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Isa had praised him before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson, welcome to join the Augustine family! Don't worry, we will definitely destroy the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> and avenge the 8,000 pirates of </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain!" Osborne said seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce nodded vigorously. "I believe you can do it! So, from now on, Kendra and I are yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, Kendra glared at him, and her pretty face turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement was ambiguous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, neither Bryce nor Osborne noticed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go back first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was preparing to take Bryce and Kendra back with him. He wanted to use Spatial Tearing and, through interdimensional travel, to quickly return to the Augustine Estate in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, something strange happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The space was extremely stable, and no dimensional rift appeared!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Bryce saw that his face looked strange and asked quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said anxiously, "It&rsquo;s bad! We've wasted too much time. Gerardo has arrived! He probably hasn't found our location yet, but he has already sealed and frozen hundreds of miles of space around us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't use interdimensional travel anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Bryce and Kendra changed their faces drastically, and their expressions became extremely solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became serious, thought quickly, and said, "Mr. Clarkson, Kendra, we must separate here! I just tried to perform interdimensional travel, and although it did not succeed, it also produced a weak spatial fluctuation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Gerardo's strength, he will be able to sense this fluctuation in half a minute! Then, he will appear here in an instant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At our speed, it's impossible to escape his pursuit! We only have a chance to escape separately! If you leave from the bottom of the sea, I will use spatial fluctuations to attract the attention of Gerardo and lure him away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finished speaking quickly, but Bryce and Kendra disagreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce said quickly, "No! How can we let you go to lure away Gerardo? I will be the one to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "Do you have spatial power? If you are being chased by Gerardo, can you escape? You can't! But I am sure I can escape! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as I can leave this sealed and frozen space, I can use interdimensional travel and escape instantly, and Gerardo can't do anything to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I am the only one who can lead Gerardo away! Take Kendra away immediately. Even if you are not afraid of death, don't you think about her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Bryce heard this, his felt conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he could only nod. "Okay! Osborne, be careful and don't get into trouble! We'll be waiting for you at the Augustine Estate in Newport City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying that, Bryce pulled Kendra and instantly entered the sea, shuttling quickly on the seabed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the two leave, Osborne breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn&rsquo;t telling the truth to Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said he was confident that he could escape, but he was actually not. The spatial power of Gerardo was much stronger than him, so Osborne could not use interdimensional travel at all in front of Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he was caught up by Gerardo, there was no way he could escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Osborne didn't say that, Bryce would definitely not leave and go with him to confront Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would be useless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Osborne was well aware of how powerful Gerardo was, even if he joined forces with Bryce, he could not be a match for Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope Gerardo hasn't fully recovered from his injuries!" he murmured and instantly flew in another direction, then tried to perform interdimensional travel again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that it was impossible to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did this just to create spatial fluctuation to attract Gerardo and allow Bryce and Kendra to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ran frantically, constantly changing direction to avoid being chased by Gerardo too quickly. Unfortunately, although his current flying speed was fast, it was still too slow compared to interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo could use interdimensional travel at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he used interdimensional travel, the distance he covered was farther than Osborne's, at least more than 310 miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything Osborne did was actually in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne felt a strong spatial fluctuation. Then, he quickly looked over and saw a tall figure standing three miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was... Gerardo!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Gerardo also saw Osborne and immediately sneered. His body disappeared in place, and the next second, he was already in front of Osborne.</span></p></div>
