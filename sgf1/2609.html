        <h1>Chapter 2497 Phantomagic Realm-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man stepped forward, looking at Osborne and Agatha with surprise and curiosity. "You really don't know the Phantomagic Realm?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is a primary Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at Agatha and was captivated by her. After all, even though Agatha had altered her aura and appearance with the Sublime Concealment Orb, she was still very beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, the man knew it was impolite to stare at someone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly said to Osborne, "That makes sense. You haven't even reached Empyrean Sacredness, so I don't think your goal is the Phantomagic Realm. After all, the Phantomagic Realm is very dangerous, and warriors below Empyrean Sacredness can hardly survive there, let alone gain any benefits."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became even more curious and started talking with the young man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man, named Azael Lefroy, came from the Galactic Stellar Region, a star region similar to the Racial Convergence Stellar Region. This time, he had followed his family elders to prepare for entering the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael said, "The Phantomagic Realm is very mysterious, a special celestial body constantly drifting along the edge of the universe. Inside, there are many small star-like bodies, but they are all illusory and unreal."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Legend has it that the Phantomagic Realm was formed from the corpse of an ancient and extremely powerful beastly sacred spirit, the Hallucimagic Dragon. Everything inside is illusory, a mirage. Anyone who enters will encounter all kinds of Heavenly Demons."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These Heavenly Demons, even the weakest, are comparable to an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, and they appear in swarms. Warriors below Empyrean Sacredness can hardly survive in the Phantomagic Realm and will be torn to pieces by the Heavenly Demons."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But if you have the ability to kill these Heavenly Demons, you can gain benefits. Each Heavenly Demon contains a trace of Demon Dragon aura. If you kill over a thousand of the lowest-level Heavenly Demons, you can gather enough Demon Dragon aura to condense a drop of Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These Dragon Elixirs are truly valuable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just one drop is enough to put you into an Enlightenment State, enhancing your comprehension and talent. Moreover, the higher the grade of the Dragon Elixir, the stronger the effect."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, it can also enhance soul power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After absorbing the Dragon Elixir, people can better resist illusions and Soul Attacks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a bit surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dragon Elixir can put people into an Enlightenment State? This effect is almost identical to Elven Sacred Water. But it doesn't sound as powerful as Elven Sacred Water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, that only refers to ordinary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dragon Elixir is divided into low-grade, mid-grade, top-grade, and Ultimate. The effects of low-grade and mid-grade Dragon Elixir are inferior to Elven Sacred Water, but top-grade Dragon Elixir is already on par with Elven Sacred Water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the effect of Ultimate Dragon Elixir is far stronger than Elven Sacred Water. Moreover, it can also enhance soul power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne became interested in the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He previously used nearly a hundred drops of Elven Sacred Water and underwent nearly a hundred enlightenments, which allowed him to elevate elemental essences like space, darkness, thunder, and fire to the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was only later that Elven Sacred Water became ineffective for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using Elven Sacred Water to enter the Enlightenment State brought him only minimal improvement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne still had many types of elemental essences, such as metal elemental, water elemental, earth elemental, wind elemental, light elemental... Currently, they were stuck at level ten peak, unable to break through to the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These elemental essences were all just at level ten peak.</span></p></div>
