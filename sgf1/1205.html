        <h1>Chapter 1204 Plan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words fell heavy in the air, leaving Sebastian, Bryce, and the others in solemn silence, their expressions once again turning grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all understood that he was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne had taken down a Dark Exotic Beast nest and eliminated a recovering Dark Deity, who could really say that was the only nest around?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could guarantee that there was only one Dark Deity nearby? It was entirely possible that more Dark Deities were currently regaining their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they had sufficient power, a confrontation was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were fortunate this time; the crisis that could have turned Newport City into rubble had been averted by Osborne's quick thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this precious time had to be used wisely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They needed to boost their strength to avoid yet another potential disaster that could wipe them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, heightening their powers wasn't going to be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the room was palpable as they all furrowed their brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Sebastian looked at Osborne and asked, "Osborne, are you saying you have a plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a slight smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Sebastian, the former Godfather, was quick to catch on to the crucial details in his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded confidently. "Exactly! I have a plan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's excitement bubbled over. "Let's hear it! How can we level up quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to Osborne, eager for answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused for a moment, gathering his thoughts before speaking, "Grandpa, our world has undergone a dramatic shift. The energies in the environment have become exponentially richer&mdash;hundreds of times more concentrated than before. This means everyone can train and improve their abilities at a faster rate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But no matter how quickly we advance, we will still lag behind those Dark Deities. They only need to recover their strength, while we have to train and push through barriers to gain power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nods of understanding rippled through the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the source of their despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deities, with their already high levels, only required enough energy to return to their peak forms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how gifted the humans were, it felt hopeless in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we have our advantages!" Osborne quickly added, noticing the glum expressions on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Advantages? What kind of advantages?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group looked at him in surprise, curiosity sparking in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Our greatest advantage lies in numbers! You've heard the saying, 'The many can take down the mighty,' right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When it comes to power levels, we can't compete with the Dark Deities. But if we gather enough Class S warriors, especially top-tier ones, even a Superior Deity would think twice before facing us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know of a training haven where the energy of the world is a hundred times more potent than what we have out here. Training there could accelerate our breakthroughs </span><span>exponentially!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, Gerardo developed a cultivation serum that can significantly boost physical strength. I happen to know the formula for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My plan is to expand the Draco Armed Services Branch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can recruit young, talented power warriors from wealthy families, Ancient Families, and even ordinary citizens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more, the merrier!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll provide them with the cultivation serum and train them in that haven. Before long, many could reach Class S or even elite Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Imagine having tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of Class S warriors at our disposal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we can arm them just like we do with the Blood Demon members&mdash;give them the best weapons, like super energy guns and top-notch defensive gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this plan comes together, the Draco Armed Services Branch would be a force to be reckoned with! Even a Superior Deity or a Transcendent Deity would have to think twice before crossing us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian was momentarily speechless, his mind racing with the possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of expanding the Draco Armed Services Branch and leveraging the cultivation serum and training ground was exhilarating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draco Armed Services Branch had been personally established by Sebastian, once regarded as Rosmandi's most formidable military force, instilling fear in the hearts of many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, times had changed, and now the strength of the Draco Armed Services Branch seemed rather paltry&mdash;at least when compared to Osborne's Blood Demon organization. The gap was simply too wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne proposed ambitious plans to expand the Draco Armed Services Branch, aiming to recruit tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of members. Sebastian, while taken aback by the scale of the idea, quickly realized it was entirely feasible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally exclaimed, a sense of excitement building, "Your plan is absolutely doable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In normal circumstances, even in the name of the Augustine family and the Draco Group, we wouldn't be able to recruit that many talented power warriors. But right now, the threat of the Beast Tide and the Dark Deities has everyone on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The wealthy families and Ancient Families are feeling vulnerable. When the Beast Tide hits, they'll be sitting ducks, waiting for doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this climate, we might just pull in a massive number of geniuses!"</span></p></div>
