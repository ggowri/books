        <h1>Chapter 2490 The Cage-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is Cosmic Wind," Angela said. "The presence of Cosmic Wind here proves that we've reached the edge of the cosmos. Moreover, the closer to the edge, the stronger the Cosmic Wind, to the point where even warriors at or above the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level cannot approach."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, some say the cosmos is actually a massive cage. The raging Cosmic Wind at the edge of the cosmos is what prevents us from leaving, like the electric fences around cattle or sheep pens."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While explaining to Osborne, Angela gently released Sacred Power to block the Cosmic Wind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha was doing the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, thinking, "The cosmos is a cage? Cosmic Wind is like an electric fence stopping us from leaving the cosmos? This idea is quite novel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a slight smile, Osborne didn't pay much attention to this idea, as the cosmos was simply too vast, with too many secrets and things he didn't know.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether Angela's words were true or not, it had nothing to do with him at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So what if the cosmos is a cage?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this massive cage, Osborne could only move near the edges of the cosmos for now, without even the strength to enter the middle regions, let alone the core area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no thoughts of leaving the cosmos or escaping this cage at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps this is something the Sovereign Masters in the center of the cosmos should ponder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just wanted to quickly find the Frenetic Storm Warband and rescue his parents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There shouldn't be anything on this abandoned resource-bearing planet. Let's not waste time and head straight to the next resource-bearing planet with a Cosmic Translocator," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Cosmic Translocator here only allowed them to teleport between this place and the Racial Convergence Planet's Cosmic Translocator; it couldn't send them deeper into Stellar Region M72. Fortunately, the Fairy Moon Sect had a rough star map of Stellar Region M72 and knew where the next resource-bearing planet with a translocator was located.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll set off from here and head to the next resource-bearing planet." Saying this, Angela pointed in an upward direction and took out a warship, which was a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Angela's strength, owning a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact-level warship was already quite impressive. After all, warships are comprehensive Sacred Artifacts, valued higher than ordinary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Mid-grade Sacred Artifact-level warship is as valuable as a Superior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela said, "With the speed of my warship, we can reach the next resource-bearing planet in three days."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne hesitated, pondering whether to take out the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum is a Supreme Sacred Artifact. Even though it's severely damaged, its speed is much faster than a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact-level warship. If a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact-level warship takes three days to reach the next resource-bearing planet, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum would only take half a day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne didn&rsquo;t do that, thinking, &ldquo;This is Stellar Region M72. I can&rsquo;t act too high-profile. If someone recognizes the Ascending Sacred Sanctum as a Supreme Sacred Artifact, I&rsquo;ll be in trouble. Besides, I need to keep some tricks up my sleeve. Anyway, it&rsquo;s just three days.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, the three of them boarded Angela's warship. Immediately, the warship set off, quickly leaving the desolate resource-bearing planet, entering the dark cosmos, and heading toward another distant resource-bearing planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, what they didn&rsquo;t notice was that on the other side of the resource-bearing planet, a small warship suddenly appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A black skull emblem was hanging on that warship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A person in a black robe faced a mirror, a Sacred Artifact, and said, "Boss, we have new prey."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They were teleported from Racial Convergence Planet. There are three of them, one man and two women. Among them, the strongest should be at mid Empyrean Sacredness, definitely not exceeding advanced Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They actually have a mid-grade Sacred Artifact-level warship. We're going to strike it rich this time. They're heading your way. Get ready to ambush them."</span></p></div>
