        <h1>Chapter 2286 Provoke Again-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bright and early the next morning, a thunderous voice echoed through every nook and cranny of the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All state duel contestants, rally at the East Gate! We're heading out to the state duel area in ten minutes. If you're late, you're out of the game."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cracked his eyes open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got up and hightailed it out of his courtyard, making a beeline for the East Gate. His plan was to get the lay of the land and size up his competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne wasn't so full of himself that he thought he could wipe the floor with everyone, no matter the playing field, the situation, or the rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, getting a head start on understanding the environment was a no-brainer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne stepped out of his courtyard, he saw folks pouring out of the neighboring ones too. Most of them were strangers to him, but he could piece together who they were by checking their courtyard numbers against the strength leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, someone hollered his name, "Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne whipped around and instantly recognized Gustave, who was ranked 103rd on the strength leaderboard. Gustave was the guy who'd hit him up about teaming up yesterday. After Osborne said no, he'd backed off gracefully, not pushing the issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne had a pretty good vibe about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gustave," Osborne greeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's mosey on over to the East Gate together." Gustave grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't say no, and the two of them strolled side by side towards the East Gate. Before long, Gustave's teammates caught up with them. There were two more than there had been yesterday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their team now totaled seven members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All seven of them were in the top 200 fighters, so it was a pretty solid team. But in Osborne's book, there was a major Achilles' heel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were lacking in heavy-hitting firepower!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave, being the team leader, was only ranked 103rd. He didn't stand a chance of getting those top 100 powerhouses on board. Even if he tried to sweet-talk them, they'd shoot him down in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave's team was well-balanced, but they were missing that knockout punch of a real champion. In the state duel, they'd probably end up getting their butts kicked by the truly tough teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rules of the state duel stated that the first three days were all about hunting for tokens. In this stage, more hands meant more tokens, and more tokens meant more points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But come the fourth day, the state duel would shift into its second gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It'd be </span><span>an </span><span>all out war!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone would be out to steal from each other. It'd be a classic case of the big dogs eating the little guys, and the little guys going after the minnows. The name of the game was to snatch other people's tokens and points while safeguarding one's own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the rankings would be decided by the final scores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without top-notch strength, there was no way to strike fear into the hearts of others. Once the state duel kicked off, Gustave's team would definitely be in the crosshairs of the top contenders. It'd be an uphill battle for them to hang onto their hard-earned points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, all these things were none of Osborne's business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne caught sight of Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara wasted no time and walked right over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, and who's this, if I may ask?" Gustave asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, "This is my partner, Clara! We're teaming up as a pair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd asked Osborne to join his team but got shot down. Osborne had said he already had a set team, so Gustave didn't push it.</span></p></div>
