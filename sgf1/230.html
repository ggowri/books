        <h1>Chapter 230 Clarissa's Change</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa and Donna had just finished breakfast. Clarissa's eyes lit up at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's this special thing you've got?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne strolled over, gently taking her hand in his. "You'll find out if you come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast a brief glance at Donna, carefully choosing not to divulge the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was best for him to keep Orion&rsquo;s death from Donna; it wasn't that Osborne didn't trust her, but some things were better kept under wraps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna studied the two of them, her expression slightly clouded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two had been getting bolder lately, flaunting their growing closeness right in front of her. It felt as though they were completely disregarding her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ultimately, Donna said, "Clarissa, you go on with him. Osborne, just remember our agreement. Your feelings for Clarissa are your business, but until you get the blessing of the Wise Order of the Radcliffe family, you must not cross the line!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Clarissa's face flushed deep crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, what are you saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, trying to lighten the mood. "Don't worry, Ms. Donna Radcliffe. I know the drill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he took Clarissa's hand and led her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna sighed, her voice tinged with resignation, "What a tumultuous time! Apollo's gone, but now more suitors are flocking to the Radcliffe family, all wanting to tie the knot with Clarissa. Even Orion had set his sights on her, and the Lark family is rolling out a level two ancient magic weapon to sweeten the deal.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder who Dad will ultimately choose for Clarissa. Whatever happens, it won't be Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recognized the change in Clarissa; since forming a bond with Osborne, Clarissa seemed happier, and her smile was brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, Donna wished Clarissa could marry someone she loved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Donna knew that decision lay far beyond their control&mdash;ultimately, it was up to Eugen and the Wise Order of the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she mulled it over, she couldn't shake the feeling that Osborne didn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suitors chasing Clarissa were far more qualified than he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's hoping when the time comes, you won't be too heartbroken, Clarissa," She muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was leading Clarissa to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's the deal? Why have you brought me to your room? You... you wouldn't be thinking of doing something inappropriate, would you?" Clarissa stammered, her cheeks pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you imagining? I'm here to show you something special, something I can't let anyone else see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he swung the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, Clarissa ultimately stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breath caught as she gazed upon the enormous iron chest that sat in the center of the room, her eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! How is this even here? Orion took it with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a realization struck her, and her astonishment was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait... did you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled softly, responding with gentle confidence, "Clarissa, Orion won't be bothering you anymore. He won't be trying to woo you at the Radcliffe Estate either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you killed him?" Clarissa </span><span>whispered,</span><span> the disbelief evident in her wide eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just keep this between us," Osborne said, a serious look crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded </span><span>vigorously,</span><span> her gaze now fixed on the chest. With a mix of eagerness and apprehension, she stepped closer, reaching out to lift the lid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it opened, the breathtaking statue of the Sacred Sorceress was revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood there, captivated, as though she had stepped into a trance. Curiosity overwhelmed her. Without thinking, she extended her hand, touching the cool stone of the statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't stop her. Having touched the statue himself, he knew it wasn't dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment Clarissa touched the statue, something extraordinary happened. A strange, dual-toned light erupted from the statue&mdash;half pure white, half eerie black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Clarissa herself was enveloped in the same bizarre radiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned ashen with shock. Fearing for Clarissa's safety, he rushed forward to pull her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in an instant, a powerful force repelled him, flinging him back so he couldn't get near Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned and deeply concerned, Osborne watched in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't come any closer. I'm fine!" Clarissa's voice rang out suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne looked on, a pair of black-light wings emerged behind Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized them instantly&mdash;these were the same wings that had appeared when Clarissa had been attacked by werewolves, saving her by dispatching them with a fierce blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, those black wings were reappearing, absorbing the light radiating from the statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wings began to shift, half turning a brilliant white, half remaining pitch black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Clarissa and the statue appeared almost identical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was in utter disbelief. He could sense a profound change occurring within Clarissa as the power from the statue was being absorbed into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force around her was intensifying rapidly, growing so overwhelming that Osborne felt his heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of this energy was even greater than that of Class B+ Orion.</span></p></div>
