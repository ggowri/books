        <h1>Chapter 2123 The Heavenly Compendium of All Beings-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a small favor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Chuck established a soul connection with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instantly, a torrent of information flooded Osborne's mind, revealing a treasure trove of peculiar materials, herbs, artifacts, and creatures he had never seen or even heard of before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was overwhelming&mdash;like an entire encyclopedia had been downloaded into his brain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was elated. He felt that the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings held even greater value for him than the Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging. After all, the Grimoire's ability to forge a Sacred Artifact was still uncertain, but the Compendium undeniably deepened his understanding of the world around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings, whenever he encountered something unfamiliar, he could simply refer to it for information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, Azure Ore, or the Soul of Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he had only heard the name "Soul of Umbra Earth" without any clue about its appearance, but now, thanks to the Compendium, he finally understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Prince Chuck!" Osborne said sincerely, his gratitude evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gifts of the Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging and the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings were invaluable. Choosing to come and save lives had proven to be the right decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he gained twenty-eight pieces of Azure Ore, but he had also secured the friendship and promise of the Sylvan Elf Clan's Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Osborne had obtained the Grimoire and the Compendium!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alfreda watched Osborne with a mix of envy and admiration, her expression conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prince Chuck, you're being way too generous! When my father asked you for the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings, you wouldn't even part with the whole thing&mdash;just gave him the first volume. And now, you're handing over the complete compendium to Osborne? I'm feeling a bit jealous here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck chuckled, "At the time, I had only compiled the first volume of the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings, so naturally, I could only give that to the King of Nature Elf. But if you want it, I can transfer the entire compendium to you right now, Princess Alfreda."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That would be amazing!" Alfreda couldn't help but smile, a touch of pride in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, Chuck copied the Compendium and sent it over to Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck announced, "Alright, it's time for us to head out!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before we entered Umbra Earth, I was pretty confident&mdash;thought I could take on anyone in the younger generation of Elf City, aside from a select few. I believed I could achieve great things here.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now that I'm here, I realize my strength is still lacking! I've learned that, in the wider world, there are people more talented than me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Chuck cast a meaningful glance at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, I've decided to leave Umbra Earth with my sister.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While there are countless treasures here, you need the strength to claim them! I've reached my limit, and I intend to focus on improving my abilities once I return.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Alfreda, I hope you both find even greater rewards! And may you return safely to Elf City! When you do, be sure to visit us at&mdash;we'll be sure to give you a warm welcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Alfreda both nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! If the chance arises, we'll definitely drop by!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go, Joanna!" Joanna said, giving a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna shot a lingering glance at Osborne, biting her lip as she said, "Osborne, I'll be waiting for you in Elf City! You must come find us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, feeling a warmth in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Letitia chimed in, "Osborne, whenever you have the time, feel free to visit us at the Human Community Federation base in Elf City! If we're not there, we might be at the Human Community Federation from the Racial Convergence Planet... and you're always welcome to visit us there one day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count on it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they bid farewell to Osborne before departing, their exploration of Umbra Earth now at an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne and Alfreda, their journey was far from over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Let's go! We need to find a safe spot. I want to study the Azure Ore first!"</span></p></div>
