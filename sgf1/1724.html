        <h1>Chapter 1723 Aldrich and Alfred</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and his companions hid within the parallel space</span><span> and </span><span>fully utiliz</span><span>ed</span><span> the Eclipsing Mantra to mask their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people in the palace remained oblivious to their approach</span><span>. P</span><span>erhaps </span><span>they </span><span>believ</span><span>ed</span><span> </span><span>that no one would dare to sneak in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the grand hall of the palace, an elderly man and a young figure occupied the highest seats, surrounded by powerful figures standing below them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center of the hall, eight guards from the Bowman family were bowing in respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah pointed at the young figure and whispered, "That's Alfred!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's one of the super geniuses of the Paramount Supreme Clan! Among the younger generation, he ranks in the top fifty for sure, which is why I included him on the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, that's only for those below the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bowman family has two other young talents who have already reached the Deity King level. These three are the strongest among the younger generation of the Bowman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While Alfred may currently be the weakest, his talent is impressive, and he's pushing to break into the Deity King level soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Hannah finished, Osborne nodded thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to the others and asked, "So, who feels confident about taking on Alfred?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave him to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I guarantee I can take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can handle him, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, Kendra, Bryce, and Mila all chimed in, their faces alight with determination and confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia remained silent, clearly unimpressed by this opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the confidence and fighting spirit radiating from the group, Osborne couldn't help but chuckle, "Well, since you're all so eager, let's settle it with a game of rock-paper-scissors! Whoever wins gets to take a shot at this Bowman family genius and show him what the Human Community is made of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement surged among the four as they prepared for the challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah watched the four of them, filled with battle spirit and confidence, her mouth slightly agape in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Alfred, the super genius of the Bowman family, known for his formidable strength, reportedly having received guidance from Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was public advice, his power was undoubtedly terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, anyone on her list was a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below the Deity King level, it was hard to find anyone capable of defeating them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, here were Anastasia, Kendra, Mila, and Bryce, all convinced they could take down Alfred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah felt a jolt of disbelief inside her, but she kept quiet, furrowing her brow as she observed the scene unfolding in the palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the elderly man at the top spoke up</span><span>, </span><span>"Let's hear what's going on here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne narrowed his eyes at the elder, feeling a sense of wariness. He couldn't gauge the man's power, but he sensed an overwhelming pressure far greater than that of Angelo or Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is definitely mid-stage Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my current strength, the only way to defeat him would be to borrow power from the Blood Demon members, elevating my realm to the peak of Deity Overlord or even to Deity King, to have a chance against him!" Osborne thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Aldrich! Tobey's father and one of the power players in the Bowman family! He's been at mid-stage Deity King for many years and is extremely formidable!" Hannah said, her expression grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Celestara, there were quite a few individuals who managed to reach the Deity King level, with many across the various races, especially among the ten Upper Races, where Deity King warriors weren't uncommon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, reaching mid-stage Deity King was a rare feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most super geniuses from various races, after breaking through to Deity King, had exhausted their potential and found it impossible to advance further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who could push through to mid-stage Deity King were fewer than one in a hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every mid-stage Deity King could dominate within a powerful faction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City, for example</span><span>, </span><span>while they had several Deity King warriors, all of them were at the early stages, with not a single mid-stage Deity King among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Aldrich, a mid-stage Deity King standing before her, a considerable threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Aldrich wanted to, he could wipe out half of the Mystic Feather Clan single-handedly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would he let the Gellar family off the hook? Or spare the Mystic Feather Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah thought with mounting dread as she locked her gaze on Aldrich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reporting, we've confirmed the death of Hannah from the Mystic Feather Clan! She was incredibly powerful and put up a fierce resistance. When she realized she had no hope of survival, she activated a unique self-detonation of her Divine Body. Eight of our members perished in the explosion!" one of the modified Bowman family guards spoke up, following Osborne's instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich's brow furrowed at the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Self-detonation of the Divine Body? Eight dead? Pathetic! We, the Bowman family, poured so many resources into training you worthless guards!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sixteen of you sent to capture a mere girl at mid-stage Deity Overlord level, and yet you couldn't bring her back? Instead, she took eight of you down with her? You've got to be kidding me!" he said coldly, his voice dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire hall fell silent, and everyone shivered under his piercing gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a tense moment, Aldrich continued, "Find out if Hannah is really dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the guards pulled out a Spirit Tracer.</span></p></div>
