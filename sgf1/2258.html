        <h1>Chapter 2227 Looking for Trouble-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them traded derisive smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance Lascelles, their leader, smirked. "Get them identity tokens? They haven't even cleared the sect's assessment! You think they can just breeze in and become inner disciples? The rest of Peak Seven won't stand for it! Becoming an inner disciple isn't just about cultivation level. Talent and potential matter too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they're lacking in talent and potential, making them inner disciples is just a waste of our resources. I am dead set against it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's face turned as cold as ice at Terrance's audacious claim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He retorted sharply, "Does your opinion even count? My teacher, Mr. Earvin </span><span>Corenswet</span><span>, has already green-lighted their admission. And as one of the top ten inner disciples of Peak Seven, I've got the power to recommend them without any assessments!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance burst out laughing, his laughter oozing with contempt. "Oh, Maddox, being in the top ten isn't all that great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're inner disciples too, and I'm ranked even higher&mdash;number four, to be precise. There's nothing to brag about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Mr. Earvin </span><span>Corenswet</span><span> has given his okay, I won't cause a ruckus... for now! But there's one assessment they can't dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the practical combat assessment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Terrance sneered and fixed his eyes on Anastasia, Zoe, and the others. "The practical combat assessment is a rule set by the Peak Lord herself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Maddox's expression changed in an instant. "A practical combat assessment? It was a rule, but it's never been put into practice..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance cut in with a smug grin. "Not anymore! I'm skeptical about their abilities, and I'm insisting they all take this combat assessment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they can't cut it, they might as well pack up and go back to where they came from!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Peak Seven of the Mystic Sirius Sect isn't a haven for the weak! If they can't even pass this practical test, what gives them the right to be called inner disciples like us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None of us here will stand for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers started whispering, and the excitement grew as more people flocked to witness the showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance's challenge resonated with the crowd, sparking enthusiastic cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's got a good point! We can skip other tests, but the practical one is non-negotiable! That's what the Peak Lord decided! Who's going to argue? If they can't pass the practical test, they don't belong here as inner disciples!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Peak Seven isn't a dumping ground for useless people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get the practical assessment started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chorus of voices made Maddox's face fall even more. He hesitated for a moment, then stole a glance at Osborne, hoping he'd have something to say about the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this practical combat assessment all about?" Osborne inquired, eager for the low-down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox quickly filled him in. "It's a test where you go head-to-head with a Wooden Golem of the same cultivation level. Peak Lord Ms. Olsen came up with this rule after our sect bombed in the last tournament, and she was mortified. She was fuming, thinking our disciples were all talk and no fight when it came to real combat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She believes having high cultivation levels but no practical combat skills just won't cut it! So, when recruiting disciples, she added this combat assessment. You've got to beat a Wooden Golem of the same level to pass."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded as he took in the information. "Are those Wooden Golems tough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox first nodded, then shook his head. "For you, Osborne, they'd be a piece of cake. You'd wipe the floor with them! But for most people, a same-level Wooden Golem is no joke... especially since Ms. Olsen makes them herself. Even I'd have to pull out all the stops to take one on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they stick to this rule like glue, I'd bet that at least half of the inner disciples on Peak Seven would get the boot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's exactly why this rule has been gathering dust until now! I never saw it coming that Terrance and his gang would use this combat assessment to throw me under the bus," Maddox said, clearly on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't too worried about Osborne or Isa. He knew they were </span><span>badasses</span><span> at their cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what about Anastasia, Zoe, </span><span>Kendra</span><span>, and the rest?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That question kept nagging at Maddox; he just couldn't stop fretting.</span></p></div>
