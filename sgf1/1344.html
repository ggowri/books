        <h1>Chapter 1343 Capture Their Leader First!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger wasn't wrong; it was nothing short of amazing that the Blood Demon members managed to hold their ground against the coalition's three factions, given the vast difference in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Counterattacks?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was almost out of the question!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their impeccable coordination, they were still simply Intermediate Deities. Even though each possessed a Divine Body of level three or higher, making them stronger than average Intermediate Deities, they were no match for Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their collective offensive was capped&mdash;unless they could muster an overwhelming numerical advantage, their attacks would struggle to inflict real harm on the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne didn't need them to dispatch foes quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the Blood Demon members had to do was create a space where Osborne could unleash his fury without being swarmed. That alone would suffice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In essence, their role was to keep the enemy occupied while leaving the slaughtering to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, the Blood Demon members sprang into action, split into ten combat teams of nearly five thousand, rapidly encircling the coalition of over a thousand fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Apocalypse Harbinger snickered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Splitting your forces? Really? If you had huddled together for defense, I might've had a tougher time, but now, you're all toast! Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barked commands to the Dark Deity Legion, fully confident in their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did he know that Osborne, who had been at the center of the encirclement, had already vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was blissfully unaware of the danger closing in on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Capture their leader first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne slipped into a parallel space, smirking as he drew nearer to Apocalypse Harbinger. The coalition's strength was overwhelming; the Dark Deity Legion was the mightiest, albeit less coordinated than the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, under Apocalypse Harbinger's leadership, they could unleash devastating power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he could take down their commander, the rest would be thrown into disarray, </span><span>each left to fend for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to take you out!" Osborne thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Navigating the parallel space, he quickly closed the distance to Apocalypse Harbinger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commander was focused on directing the Dark Deity Legion, paying little mind to the potential threat looming over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had a solid protection detail of twenty Transcendent Deity warriors at his side, guarding him closely, ever vigilant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such circumstances, it seemed ludicrous that anyone would dare attack Apocalypse Harbinger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if someone did, he was convinced no one could threaten his safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That provided Osborne with the perfect opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty Transcendent Deity warriors guarding you, huh? Let's see if I can take them all down in an instant," he muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Channeling his focus, he activated Satan's Eye, scanning the twenty warriors for any cracks in their defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It'll be a tough nut to crack. All twenty are Transcendent Deities, and they excel in defense. Even if I could take out a Transcendent Deity in a heartbeat, taking them all out at once before finishing off Apocalypse Harbinger? That's a tall order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I have to eliminate him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members are ultimately too weak&mdash;just Intermediate Deities! If I let Apocalypse Harbinger keep directing the battle, the Dark Deity Legion will pose a massive threat to them. I need to end this now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of murderous intent sparked in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guess I'll just borrow a bit of power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided to take a bold risk by tapping into the power of the Blood Demon members. This move would dramatically boost his own strength, giving him a shot at obliterating twenty Transcendent Deity warriors and, more importantly, taking out Apocalypse Harbinger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, such an act would weaken the Blood Demon members, leaving them vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, each member was safeguarded by the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, granting them essentially immortality. Should anything go wrong, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity could resurrect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering this, some risk seemed worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, through the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, began to draw power from the Blood Demon members. His energy fluctuations grew increasingly intense as he quickly absorbed a third of the power from each member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His own realm soared from early Superior Deity to peak Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a hair's breadth away from a breakthrough to Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While I didn't quite make it to Transcendent Deity, this is more than sufficient! And, I can't siphon any more power from the Blood Demon members; otherwise, they'd be left defenseless! Now, the killing begins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes flashed with murderous intent. Bursting with divine power, he felt like </span><span>a volcano about to erupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce battle cry, "Die!" Osborne materialized behind Apocalypse Harbinger, unleashing his long-accumulated attack with devastating fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous explosion followed, engulfing Apocalypse Harbinger and the twenty Transcendent Deity warriors protecting him in a maelstrom of destruction.</span></p></div>
