        <h1>Chapter 2706 Torturing Naomi</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes turned red instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Alfreda killed by Naomi, he was so furious he nearly ground his teeth to dust.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Alfreda could be resurrected after death, the pain of dying was not so easily endured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's urge to kill Naomi erupted like a volcano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You&rsquo;re fucking asking for it. I&rsquo;ll kill you!" Osborne growled through gritted teeth, instantly appearing in front of Naomi.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is that possible? How did you get here so fast?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She immediately wanted to flee. Although she was confident in her own strength, Osborne's battle record was terrifying. Back in Fairy Moon Sect, he had seriously injured Weston with a single arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston was much stronger than her!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew she stood no chance against Osborne. She could only choose to run away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, Osborne wouldn&rsquo;t let her escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, a massive pitch-black Stele appeared behind him and was quickly activated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of the Domain Suppression Stele swiftly suppressed the energy flow within the entire Elf City, causing Naomi's movements to slow down instantly, her face showing utter shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Domain Suppression Stele?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Domain Suppression Stele was exchanged by Osborne from the Royal Treasury using Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. As a princess, Naomi had entered the Royal Family's treasury more than once to select a suitable Supreme Sacred Artifact. Naturally, she had seen the Domain Suppression Stele before and remembered it vividly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the time, she found the function of the Domain Suppression Stele ridiculous, as it indiscriminately suppressed energy flow, leaving only physical strength usable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To her, this thing was completely useless!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, as a member of the Human Community, her body was weak and couldn't compare to other races. Using the Domain Suppression Stele would essentially mean helping the enemy suppress her own strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, she believed no one would value the Domain Suppression Stele.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, she saw it in Osborne's hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Domain Suppression Stele suppressed energy flow, leaving them only able to use physical strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Naomi not only remained calm but even became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason she feared Osborne was because of his strange bow and arrows, as well as his terrifying archery skills.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, with the Domain Suppression Stele suppressing energy flow, Osborne could no longer use such archery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Naomi stopped running.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly turned around and swiftly launched an attack on Osborne. Osborne was merely an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, while she was a Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both being from the Human Community, she was confident her physical strength surpassed Osborne's!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, go to hell!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi drew a Sacred Artifact Sword and fiercely stabbed it toward Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing Naomi's sword thrust, he didn't dodge, letting the Sacred Artifact Sword strike his chest with a crisp clang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Artifact Sword didn't even pierce his skin!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Energy couldn't flow, and the power of the Sacred Artifact couldn't erupt. Relying solely on the sword's sharpness and Naomi's strength, breaking through Osborne's defense was simply impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this possible?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi was stunned. Watching Osborne block her attack with his body, she suddenly panicked, a flash of terror in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne made his move at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Naomi, you deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grabbed Naomi's Sacred Artifact Sword. With a slight force, Naomi lost control of the sword. She felt a terrifying power snatch the sword from her hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This power was terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi finally understood why Osborne activated the Domain Suppression Stele.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's power far surpassed hers!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "I'm no match for Osborne! I must escape immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi tried to escape again, but Osborne was faster. He thrust the Sacred Artifact Sword he had taken straight forward, piercing her thigh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi let out a painful scream. Her thigh was pierced, and escaping became a distant dream. Gritting her teeth, she drew another Sacred Artifact Sword, ready to fight Osborne to the death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, a small gap in strength is called a desperate fight; a huge gap is just courting death!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Naomi was practically courting death. Osborne effortlessly snatched the second Sacred Artifact Sword from her hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he swiftly pierced her other leg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi let out another piercing scream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She realized that relying solely on physical strength, she was as weak as a baby in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne was simply a beast!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne seemed invincible to her. She couldn't comprehend how a Human Community could possess such a powerful physique. In her impression, not even the warriors of the Beast Clan could achieve this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Naomi felt a bit of despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She regretted following Isa and Clarissa's trail to this place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her regret was useless now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's fury completely boiled over; he wouldn't let Naomi off easily. Not to mention the grudge he already had with Naomi, just the fact that she killed Alfreda was enough to drive Osborne mad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda had just been resurrected!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda, who had just awakened from the darkness, was killed by Naomi again!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He must make Naomi pay!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne held two Supreme Sacred Artifact Swords. Without energy flow, these swords were merely hard and sharp ordinary blades.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kept a cold face, repeatedly driving the sword into Naomi's body, piercing hole after hole in her. He watched her blood gush out with indifference.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne even worried she might die like this, using the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to heal her wounds and help her recover quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of the sword piercing flesh, combined with Naomi's shrill screams, echoed through the entire Elf City, sending chills down the spine of everyone who heard it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Isa and Clarissa felt an immense sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of Alfreda's fate, their eyes were filled with hatred. Clarissa drew a blade, walked up to Naomi, and stabbed her directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's you who killed Alfreda!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why did you hurt Alfreda?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clarissa was nearly insane as she kept torturing Naomi.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi felt extreme pain and wished to die immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne kept treating her, making it impossible for her to even die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She began to plead, her voice extremely shrill. "Osborne, stop! I'm your sister!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although we don't share the same mother, we have the same father!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, please let me go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at her coldly. "Sister? Ridiculous! Who acknowledged that? You didn&rsquo;t say so before! Didn&rsquo;t you call me a bastard, a bastard tainting the Royal Family's bloodline? Now you&rsquo;re willing to admit my identity?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are truly pathetic!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, that was the past me; the present me has nothing to do with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne thrust the sword into Naomi's mouth, shredding her tongue, leaving her unable to speak and only able to let out piercing screams.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, stop for now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa shouted anxiously, "Hurry and revive Alfreda! There was already a major problem with her fusion with the Elven Mother Tree before she died..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm worried that even after reviving Alfreda, these problems won't be resolved!"</span></p></div>
