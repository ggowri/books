        <h1>Chapter 2676 Convergence-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick was extremely furious, filled with murderous intent, and launched an attack on Adriana without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is still in Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, compared to before, Frederick's energy had clearly become more robust and fierce. At this moment, the dark red Panoply Armor on him shimmered with a bright crimson glow, as if breaking through some kind of seal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It is clearly an Imperial Artifact Armor!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ornate longsword in Frederick's hand was also emanating intense Imperial Artifact energy, so it was an Imperial Artifact Sword!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, a terrifying attack capable of shattering the heavens and earth instantly struck Adriana's back. Adriana spat out a mouthful of blood, and a sword mark appeared on her Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor. However, she didn&rsquo;t turn around; instead, she used the immense force to rush even faster toward the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, she and May vanished into the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick grew even angrier. "Damn it! You can't escape! This place is incredibly far from the Racial Convergence Planet. I won't let you return. I prepared for tens of thousands of years to finally enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket and gain the power to break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, but you ruined it. My breakthrough failed at the last moment, delaying my advancement to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness even further."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I won't let you go! You're dead! Chase her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick furiously chased after Adriana, with Callista following behind him. At this moment, Callista's body was also radiating the powerful energy of Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, in the Skyfall Casket, she also gained immense benefits, breaking through Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness to reach Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, becoming a supreme warrior on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She followed behind Frederick and madly rushed into the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, none of them noticed that at this moment, the hundreds of people following behind them, including Weston and Quinn, suddenly exchanged glances and revealed eerie smiles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A profoundly mysterious vortex emerged in their eyes. But soon, the vortex vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can finally leave," the hundreds murmured in unison. Then, they returned to normal and rushed into the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, Adriana also didn't notice that May beside her revealed an eerie smile, with a black vortex appearing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May whispered, "I&rsquo;m finally out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, after leaving the black vortex, Adriana prepared to take May into the void, intending to cross the void back to Racial Convergence Planet after shaking off their pursuers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just then, she suddenly saw a translocator in the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Level Three Cosmic Translocator? How can there be a Level Three Cosmic Translocator here? There was clearly nothing here when we came," Adriana said in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had no idea that this Level Three Cosmic Translocator was built by Osborne. Osborne had already returned to Racial Convergence Planet through the translocator, leaving it behind here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana felt the black vortex shaking violently. She knew Frederick and the others would soon catch up. So, without hesitation, she took May and rushed into the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, she activated the translocator and disappeared from the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick emerged from the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Adriana and May disappear into the translocator, his expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! She actually prepared a complete Level Three Cosmic Translocator in advance?" Frederick was furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought the translocator was something Adriana had prepared in advance. At this moment, he rushed into the translocator, only to find it collapsing rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was because Adriana tampered with the translocator before leaving to prevent Frederick from catching up.</span></p></div>
