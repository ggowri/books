        <h1>Chapter 2641 Primordial Energy-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Celestial Spire, exchanging treasures and resources with battle points has one major drawback: it all depends on what Osborne knows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he could name the item, he could probably exchange for it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if he doesn't know what to exchange for, Celestial Spire won't provide him with a list to choose from.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is currently facing this dilemma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He has a huge amount of battle points but has no idea what to exchange for. Even 200 drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir only cost him 200 billion battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His battle points still amount to 3.13 trillion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How to spend these battle points is a real problem!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "If I had known, I should have learned more from Primordial! I have no idea what treasures the cosmos holds, so I can't exchange anything from Toby."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could I just make something up?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head, dismissing the idea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe I can only exchange for some Imperial Artifacts!" Osborne said helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you decided what to exchange for?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby didn't rush Osborne, nor did he give him any hints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his view, a Human like Osborne, born in the edge regions of the cosmos, couldn't possibly know what truly valuable things are.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fact that he knew about the Perfect Dragon Elixir already surprised Toby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now Osborne looked conflicted, clearly unsure of what to exchange for.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and asked, "How many battle points are needed to exchange for the best Imperial Artifact armor?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "The most basic low-grade Imperial Artifact requires 5 billion battle points! A mid-grade Imperial Artifact requires 50 billion battle points! A top-grade Imperial Artifact requires 500 billion battle points! An Ultimate Imperial Artifact requires 5 trillion battle points! The best supreme Imperial Artifact requires 50 billion battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the armor you mentioned is twice as expensive as regular Imperial Artifacts due to its complex forging process."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With your current battle points, you can exchange for three top-grade Imperial Artifact armors! But I advise against it, because not to mention top-grade Imperial Artifact armors, you can't even use low-grade Imperial Artifact armors right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The moment you put on a top-grade Imperial Artifact armor, your body would collapse first! With your Sacred Power, you can't even activate a top-grade Imperial Artifact armor, so exchanging for it is pointless! If your strength improves a bit, you might be able to use a low-grade Imperial Artifact armor..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sighed helplessly and said, "Can't I use it later? Once I leave here, I won't have anywhere to exchange it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby smiled and said, "That's not the case! You can still come back in the future! You've passed the twenty-seventh level's trial, so you've earned a second chance to enter the Celestial Spire!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Cultivation Shackle of the Celestial Spire has loosened its restrictions on you... Before your cultivation level reaches Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, you can come back to the Celestial Spire once more to continue the trials you haven't completed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If next time you can pass the fifty-fourth level of the Celestial Spire, you'll gain a third chance to enter the Celestial Spire, and the Cultivation Shackle will be further loosened!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In short, every time you complete twenty-seven levels of trials, you gain an additional chance to enter the Celestial Spire!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said in surprise, "I can enter the Celestial Spire a second time? As long as I don't exceed Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I can come back again to continue the trials and earn battle points?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said excitedly, "That's awesome!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Celestial Spire has ninety-nine levels but restricts entry to those below Empyrean Sacredness, it's totally unreasonable! No matter how strong they are, it's impossible for them to clear all ninety-nine levels of trials!"</span></p></div>
