        <h1>Chapter 2516 Dragon Elixir</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gently waved his hand. All the surrounding Demon Dragon's Breath instantly flew into his hand, over a thousand strands in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each strand was as insignificant as a hair. They intertwined and merged in his palm, quickly forming a drop of black liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's Dragon Elixir!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this Dragon Elixir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out a jadeflare vial and carefully stored the Dragon Elixir inside. Sensing the aura of the Dragon Elixir, he didn't notice anything unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial urged, "Hurry, let me see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne handed the jadeflare vial to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Primordial opened his mouth and drank the Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this what you call 'taking a look'? You just drank it! You should have said 'let me taste it' instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne wasn't angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Dragon Elixir came rather easily. Those Illusionary Heavenly Demons only looked massive and terrifying, but they weren't actually strong. Although their cultivation level was at primary Empyrean Sacredness, their strength was even weaker than the contestants at the zone duel who were only Ascension Ten Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Killing those Illusionary Heavenly Demons posed no difficulty for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tastes good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing the Dragon Elixir, Primordial closed his eyes, seemingly savoring it. But soon, he opened his eyes, his expression somewhat intoxicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, compared to Elven Sacred Water, this falls far short!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This should be Mid-grade Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial handed the jadeflare vial back to Osborne. "This Dragon Elixir indeed has a hallucinatory power. After drinking it, I experienced incredibly vivid illusions, as if I had traveled through half the Stellar Region in an instant. It truly has the effect of comprehending the heavens and earth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, its grade is a bit low. If it were Top-grade Dragon Elixir or Legendary Dragon Elixir, that would be perfect! The effect of Top-grade Dragon Elixir should rival Elven Sacred Water, while Legendary Dragon Elixir would definitely surpass Elven Sacred Water. That would truly benefit you greatly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Primordial looked into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, if I'm not mistaken, a thousand of the weakest Illusionary Heavenly Demons condense into Low-grade Dragon Elixir. A thousand primary Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons condense into Mid-grade Dragon Elixir. And a thousand mid Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons condense into Top-grade Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A thousand advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons condense into Legendary Dragon Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, let's keep going deeper. If possible, try to get more Top-grade or Legendary Dragon Elixirs. Once we leave here, we probably won't come across these things again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought the same, but the most important thing now was to find the Frenetic Storm Warband. Only after finishing the main task would he have the mood to collect Dragon Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, no need to rush!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now you're trapped in an independent illusionary space. Even if you want to find someone, there's nowhere to look! I guess this independent illusionary space will only disappear when the time is up. For example, in the first half of the month, everyone entering the Phantomagic Realm could only collect Dragon Elixirs here. When the time is up, the independent illusionary space disappears."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, those still alive will appear in the same area, and then you can look for them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought about it and found it made a lot of sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since that's the case, I'll collect Dragon Elixirs first and wait for this independent illusionary space to disappear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Satan's Eye couldn't see through this illusionary space, nor could he break it, so he could only wait for it to disappear before looking for the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued deeper with Primordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne saw another asteroid belt made up of small celestial bodies, with thousands of massive asteroids floating in the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his Satan's Eye, these asteroid bodies appeared quite ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But with his previous experience, he knew these asteroid bodies were likely Illusionary Heavenly Demons. As soon as he approached, they would activate and eventually transform into real Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, what will they turn into?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t rush to approach but carefully observed and sensed. Gradually, he felt some power emanating from these asteroid bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "Is it mid Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt these asteroid bodies would eventually transform into Illusionary Heavenly Demons of mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Thousands of mid Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons? This is a bit troublesome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he summoned Flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash was a mutated Astralwreck Dragon. Adult Astralwreck Dragons feed on stars, capable of easily destroying an entire Stellar Region or even a galaxy, with terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although young Flash's cultivation level was only at primary Empyrean Sacredness, he could still hold his ground against Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those mid Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons couldn't withstand even a casual punch from him. Moreover, he was a battle maniac, craving fights. He would only grow stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne summoned Flash, satisfying his desire for battle while quickly dealing with the Illusionary Heavenly Demons and collecting Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne ordered, "Flash, do you see those meteoric bodies? They're all slumbering Illusionary Heavenly Demons. Charge over and wipe them all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash instantly became extremely excited. Transforming into his true form, revealing three heads and six pairs of wings in a ferocious appearance, he dashed into the cluster of meteoric bodies at terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, those meteoric bodies indeed came to life, twisting and transforming. Soon, they turned into a group of enormous naked women!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation left Osborne dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But looking at these enormous naked women, he felt they seemed familiar. Soon, he remembered&mdash;they resembled the Wingless Angels sleeping in the transparent coffins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The forms of these Illusionary Heavenly Demons change based on the strongest opponent in each being's memory! I think the Magma Devourer is one of the toughest enemies I've ever faced, so the Illusionary Heavenly Demons I activated are the Magma Devourer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the Illusionary Heavenly Demons activated by Flash turned out to be the Wingless Angels from the transparent coffins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be that, in his mind, the Wingless Angel is very powerful and hard to deal with?" Osborne speculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Flash has already acted. These huge naked women are indeed just mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors. There are thousands of them. At this point, they frantically attacked Flash. His six pairs of wings vibrated. He's incredibly fast, and he's incredibly flexible. In the midst of all these attacks, he ducked easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, his three heads continuously spewed Dragon's Breath, freezing, disintegrating, or melting those Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His claws and teeth could also easily tear apart the Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, at least a hundred Illusionary Heavenly Demons were killed by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne no longer hesitated and joined the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So many mid Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons were worth him using the most powerful Earth Arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Arrow Storm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Countless Sacred Power Arrows instantly formed and shot out!</span></p></div>
