        <div><p>“To my place,” Isa said matter-of-factly.</p><p>“To your place?”</p><p>Osborne’s eyes widened, and he swallowed. “That doesn’t seem right. I’ve just gotten divorced…”</p><p>Isa chuckled and puffed out her chest proudly, her eyes full of seductive charm. “So what if you just got divorced? Are you scared? Don’t you want to have me? I know many positions that will make you crave more.”</p><p>With Isa’s flirtatious words, Osborne found himself parched and tongue-tied.</p><p>She was truly a witch.</p><p>But there was definitely a scheme.</p><p>Osborne calmed himself and said, “Isa, please be serious. I’m not that kind of man. Besides, I need to go to the hospital now to pick up my sister.”</p><p>With that, Osborne was ready to leave.</p><p>Isa glared at him and said irritably, “I was just teasing you. I told you to come to my place because your sister was there.”</p><p>Osborne sighed in relief.</p><p>He almost thought that Isa’s invitation was genuinely about getting intimate.</p><p>Luckily, he sensed something was off in time.</p><p>She was like a siren and known as the Night Witch for a reason. He never knew which of her words were true and which were a lie.</p><p>With this thought, Osborne quickly got on the motorcycle.</p><p>Isa said gruffly, “Hold onto my waist tight. Don’t fall. When did my charm become so ineffective? All this effort to seduce you, and you don’t take the bait?”</p><p>Osborne gave an awkward smile and asked, “What would happen if I did bite?”</p><p>“If you bit, I’d castrate you,” Isa responded coldly.</p><p>Osborne felt a chill down below and dared not speak any further.</p><p>Isa smiled smugly, and the motorcycle roared to life.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a small building in the suburbs.</p><p>Osborne let go of Isa’s waist, looked up at the building, which was very old and covered in lush greenery, and noticed an even more ancient signboard hanging on the door.</p><p>Institute of Human Research.</p><p>“Human research?”</p><p>Osborne’s brow furrowed deeply as he stared at Isa’s back, full of suspicion.</p><p>Was this woman really a legitimate doctor?</p><p>Despite his doubts, Osborne followed her inside.</p><p>Although the building’s exterior was ancient, its interior was beautifully and delicately decorated. Only a few janitors were sweeping, and there was seemingly no one else around.</p><p>Soon, they reached a ward deep inside the building.</p><p>“Your sister is here.” Isa opened the door. “Her illness is quite peculiar. I can’t cure it right now.”</p><p>Osborne nodded, his gaze fixed on the frail, pale figure on the hospital bed.</p><p>That was his sister, Anastasia Augustine.</p><p>She was not his biological sister. He had found her near a garbage dump when he was ten.</p><p>At the time, Anastasia was nearly starved to death. Osborne gave her the last half of a piece of bread. From then on, he had a sister. Ten-year-old Osborne and five-year-old Anastasia started their days of wandering together.</p><p>They slept under bridges when tired, rummaged through garbage bins when hungry, and even fought with stray dogs for food.</p><p>It was a year later when they were finally taken to an orphanage.</p><p>Whenever someone bullied Anastasia, Osborne would fiercely protect her, and every time Osborne was bullied, Anastasia, like a furious lioness, would fight desperately for him.</p><p>They were not real siblings, but they were closer than many who were.</p><p>When Osborne was admitted to university and left the orphanage, thirteen-year-old Anastasia didn’t hesitate to leave with him.</p><p>Osborne juggled his studies and part-time jobs to take care of her. Though it was hard, he felt happy.</p><p>In Osborne’s heart, Anastasia was more important than anyone else.</p><p>Unfortunately, misfortune always struck at the weakest.</p><p>Not long after, Anastasia fell ill.</p><p>It was a strange illness that could not be diagnosed, rapidly draining Anastasia’s vitality and requiring a significant amount of money to keep her alive.</p><p>A large part of the reason Osborne had accepted Ophelia’s advances was to finance Anastasia’s medical treatment.</p><p>That treatment lasted seven years.</p><p>Anastasia’s condition worsened, her lucid moments dwindled, and not long ago, the hospital had issued a critical condition notice.</p><p>“How long can my sister live?”</p><p>Osborne’s voice was somewhat hoarse and choked up.</p><p>Isa calmly said, “Without specific medication, she can only survive for seven more days.”</p><p>“Seven days?”</p><p>Osborne staggered, feeling as if his heart was being squeezed.</p></div>
