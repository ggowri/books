        <h1>Chapter 1681 A Heavy Blow to Deathborn King</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn King struggled violently against the mind control shackles that bound him, desperate to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though both he and Angelo were Deity Kings, Angelo's Mind Control Shackle was powerful but not enough to completely restrain the King. Deathborn King's efforts grew more frantic, and it was clear he was on the verge of escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Osborne </span><span>cast</span><span> the Eclipse of Eternity around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around Deathborn King thickened with darkness. He could see nothing, hear nothing, and lost every sense of his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he had been dropped into an abyss where all awareness vanished</span><span>. T</span><span>here was no up or down, no back or front. He was utterly disoriented. In this suffocating darkness, Osborne made his move with his most formidable attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abyssal Spear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive black spear materialized, swirling with ominous energy. It seemed to absorb the very light around it, rendering its shape nearly indistinguishable&mdash;like a black hole, it devoured illumination and drew everything into its void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo gasped, "This is... the Eclipse of Eternity combined with Abyssal Spear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the ultimate technique of the esteemed Lord Malevolence. This dark power is truly fearsome! He really is a genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan</span><span>! T</span><span>here's no doubt he's been personally trained by the esteemed Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's excitement peaked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doubts about Osborne's true identity faded away, replaced by awe. He</span><span> </span><span>briefly questioned whether Osborne was really part of the Paramount Supreme Clan, </span><span>as he had never heard of this </span><span>name "Christopher"</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, witnessing the execution of these legendary techniques, he </span><span>trusted </span><span>Osborne. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because both Eclipse of Eternity and Abyssal Spear were Lord Malevolence's unique skill</span><span>s</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not everyone with dark power could master these two techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Onl</span><span>y </span><span>Lord Malevolence</span><span>'s kids and several close disciples </span><span>had mastered both the Eclipse of Eternity and Abyssal Spear</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo</span><span> didn't doubt </span><span>Osborne</span><span>'s identity anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abyssal Spear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shouted fiercely, channeling enough power into the spear. It shot forward like a ghostly beam, striking toward Deathborn King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bound by the Mind Control Shackles and engulfed in total darkness, </span><span>the </span><span>Deathborn King couldn't </span><span>avoid</span><span> the attack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Abyssal Spear reached him, he was caught completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumbling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spear collided with tremendous force, unleashing an explosion of dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Abyssal Spear, renowned for its tearing and penetrating capabilities, shattered through the King's defenses with horrifying ferocity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the fact that he was a Deity King with formidable protective abilities, the spear </span><span>pierced</span><span> </span><span>through his body</span><span>, leaving a gaping hole in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A</span><span>rgh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spear pierced through Deathborn King, exiting through his back. The devastating force wrought destruction within him, and he screamed in agony as dark energy coiled around the gruesome wound, instantly staining the ground with blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelming surge of power erupted from Deathborn King's body, shattering Angelo's Mind Control Shackles along with Osborne's eternal darkness. As the shadows receded, Deathborn King re-emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he looked disheveled, a massive wound gaping in his chest and blood pouring forth. Even with his impressive regeneration, this injury seemed beyond repair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn King roared in pain, and his eyes blazed with fury as he glared at Osborne and Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will kill you both!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He didn't die! The vitality of a Deity King is truly remarkable. Such a powerful attack didn't finish him off, and now he's breaking free and yelling at us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abyssal Spear was his strongest attack, his ticket to battling a Deity King, yet it hadn't been enough to claim victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he remained untroubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Angelo and said, "I've severely wounded him! The rest is up to you. Go finish him off! I've used up so much power already, and I need a moment to recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's face lit up, and he beamed. "Of course, Mr. Bowman. You'd better take your time to recuperate. I'll take care of this damn Deathborn King. After all, he's already in such bad shape from your attack. I promise I'll put him down quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Angelo charged in without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce battle ignited once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn King, now gravely injured, found himself overwhelmed and unable to mount a serious defense against Angelo's relentless onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his injuries and weakening spirit, Deathborn King's resilience was astounding. He roared and howled in agony, but he refused to fall, and his powerful life force pushed him onward even as wounds multiplied across his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo, throwing everything he had into the fight, struggled to finish off his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The damage he had dealt was substantial, but it was clear now that Deathborn King was still hanging on with fierce determination. If it weren't for the grievous injuries inflicted by Osborne's Abyssal Spear, the tide of battle might have already turned in favor of Deathborn King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growing increasingly anxious, Angelo realized that he had intended to showcase his strength in front of Osborne, but the longer he failed to deliver the final blow, the more humiliated he felt. T</span><span>he </span><span>wors</span><span>t part was coming. H</span><span>e sensed the impending arrival of the Deathborn Army!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne furrowed his brow, his focus sharpening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he used Satan's Eye to scan the area, his face changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! The Deathborn Army is </span><span>coming soon</span><span>! They'll be here within half a minute!"</span></p></div>
