        <h1>Chapter 2507 A Demonic Cultivator</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Layne's small courtyard, there was only a beautiful woman serving him at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The soul fluctuation of this beautiful woman was equally strange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Osborne had already seen dozens of women from Blossom Cage. These women shared one common trait: they were all beautiful, easily stirring the primal desires of any male being.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could make those men eager to sleep with them, venting their desires on them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But their true common trait was the soul fluctuation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The soul fluctuation of all the beautiful women from Blossom Cage that Osborne had seen was exactly the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They only differed in appearance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their identical soul fluctuation indicated that they were actually the same being, just like Osborne and his Spatial Clone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Spatial Clone requires a strand of his soul power to condense, so the soul fluctuation of each Spatial Clone is exactly the same as his original body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the difference is that his Spatial Clone is condensed from energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But these women all have real bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly, thinking, "Did they use the Clone Technique? But why do they have real bodies? Can the Clone Technique be this powerful? Moreover, apart from having the same soul fluctuation, everything else about them is different."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each woman possesses a different power, and their Sacred Power aura is distinct."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't figure it out, so he simply stopped thinking about it and carefully examined Layne's condition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Layne was acting very strange at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked somewhat exhausted, as if overly indulgent, yet he was still passionately making love with that beautiful woman. It seemed as though something peculiar was rapidly draining from his body and entering the woman beneath him, who wore an expression of pure pleasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's going on?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt something was off. Layne was an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior; with his physical condition, how could he possibly show signs of overindulgence or exhaustion?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he made love with a woman for three months, he would still be full of energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Also, what exactly is leaking from his body?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that if this continued, Layne would be in danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't figure it out, so he called for Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial transformed into a small tree figure, appeared on Osborne's shoulder, and looked puzzled. "What's the matter?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said with some dissatisfaction, "I was playing with Drum, just managed to cheer Drum up and was about to ask Drum to help purify my body, but then you called me out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne ignored his complaints and quickly explained the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After listening, Primordial also showed a thoughtful expression. "Are you sure they all have real bodies, different powers and attributes, but exactly the same soul fluctuation?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded confidently, "I can't be wrong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After his Satan's Eye broke through to the Sacredness Level, whenever he looked at anyone, he could quickly analyze their energy and type of power, and he had never been wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There&rsquo;s only one possibility," Primordial said calmly. "You might have entered a dangerous place. These women are real people, not avatars, but they are being controlled. Their Soul Current Ocean has been occupied by someone else's soul, turning them into puppets."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Behind the Blossom Cage, there is an existence with extremely powerful soul power. He uses soul power to control these women, turning them into tools for making money. Or perhaps, not just for money."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You said Layne is very tired, and something is leaking from his body, being absorbed by that woman?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, what&rsquo;s pouring out of Layne is his vital essence, soul power, and even potential. This is the authentic method of a demonic cultivator!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's sort this out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial thought for a moment and said, "The owner of Blossom Cage is a demonic cultivator. He enhances his power by absorbing others' vital essence, soul power, and even potential. His soul power is very strong, controlling many beautiful women as puppets. These women seduce his targets, making them drown in desire, and unknowingly have their vital essence, soul power, and potential drained."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The owner of Blossom Cage is a demonic cultivator?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the women in Blossom Cage are his puppets, tools to help him absorb the target's vital essence, soul power, and even potential to enhance his strength?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Blossom Cage, guests aren't just spending money for fun; they're gambling with their lives.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply. "This doesn't make sense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Blossom Cage has been around for many years, and I haven't heard of anyone dying while having fun here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial sneered, "That's his brilliance. He never drains the target all at once but does it in many stages. Even if the target feels unwell, they'd just think it's from overindulgence and recover after some rest. After many times, he completely drains them and uses soul power to take over their Soul Current Ocean, turning them into his puppet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, Layne is probably in such a situation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then the mastermind behind Blossom Cage is probably about to act on Layne, planning to completely drain him this time and turn him into their puppet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious. "What will Layne become after being drained and turned into their puppet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shrugged. "Although his body is still alive, his soul would have long been replaced, turning him into a walking corpse serving the other party."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That version of him is as good as dead." Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't let that happen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Layne is his only clue to finding Frenetic Storm Warband and rescuing his parents. If Layne gets drained by Blossom Cage's boss and turned into their puppet, how can he still find Frenetic Storm Warband?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "I advise you not to meddle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The boss of Blossom Cage is a demonic cultivator, cunning and powerful, definitely not someone you can handle right now. If you meddle, you'll likely get into trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The boss of Blossom Cage is at least an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want to die, don't drag me into it. I advise you to leave Blossom Cage immediately. Otherwise, you'll become their target too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you get drained, don't blame me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression grew more serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He left Layne and walked away from Blossom Cage? Osborne didn't want to do that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at the small courtyard in the distance. The flaws in Layne's body grew larger, wildly leaking his vital essence, soul power, and even potential. He became increasingly weak, yet seemed trapped in an illusion, completely unaware.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this continues, Layne will inevitably be drained, his Soul Current Ocean taken over, and he will become the other's puppet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! I can't let Layne die like this!" Osborne said coldly. If Layne died, he wouldn't know when he'd get news of the Frenetic Storm Warband again or be able to rescue his parents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, every day of delay puts his parents in greater danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He must save Layne.</span></p></div>
