        <h1>Chapter 548 Ambush</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone looked at Osborne in surprise and didn't understand what he was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In their opinion, Osborne had ten minutes to escape. He should use these ten minutes to run as far away as possible so that others would have no way to catch up with him quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne had no intention of leaving at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Isaac looked puzzled. "What does Osborne want to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Haha."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think he has given up. He is destined to be caught up and lose his emblem, so he might save his energy and hand it over as soon as possible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's right. He didn't run away because he gave up. If I were him, I would probably give up too because there is no chance of winning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He gave up to avoid getting hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He is smart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although everyone said this, there was mockery and sarcasm in their voices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They all looked at Isaac and others from the Dampston branch bloodline with mockery in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Coward!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan and the others immediately clenched their fists, looking angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne is not a coward!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He is not a coward! He must have a plan. Just wait and see. He will surprise you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa shouted, but she was also unsure in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was Osborne doing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't know that his decision had caused the audience at Challenge Peak to start quarreling because of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He just made preparations silently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He first pretended to escape to the east and then quickly returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have to find a way to hide. Many people of the nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family have Satan's Eye, and they can see through things with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Although their X-ray vision is not as good as mine, the dense jungle can't block their sight. They will be able to find that I haven't left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, I should hide first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can hide underground. Using the power of the earth elemental, I can hide myself 33 feet underground. They will not be able to find me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne prepared to take action but soon stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No. I can't use the power of earth elemental here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, they will sense the fluctuations in my abilities and know that I use the earth elemental. They will guess that I am hiding underground and will be careful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought about all the possibilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he quickly moved to the west and walked hundreds of feet away before using the power of the earth elemental.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the soil under his feet became soft and wrapped around his body. Osborne's figure quickly disappeared from the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What on earth is he doing? Is he planning to hide here? Haha. Is there something wrong with his brain? Has he forgotten the emblem will send signals in a while and he will be easily located?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Haha. I have a feeling that he's going to be caught soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if he hides underground, he can't escape."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's not the only one who possesses the power of the earth elemental."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But they didn't know that Osborne was moving quickly underground and returned to the ambush site he had chosen, hiding 33 feet underground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, he would wait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne used Satan's Eye, and the 33-feet-deep soil could not block his X-ray vision, allowing him to check the situation on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He checked the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ten minutes had passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this time, following the order from Caleb, Sam, David, Rodney, and others quickly rushed off the helicopter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Haha, the second emblem belongs to me. If anyone dares to fight with me for it, I will break his limbs and crush his bones!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam looked at everyone threateningly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney snorted coldly, "Sam, this is a fair competition. We will fight for the emblem based on our abilities."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, he suddenly increased his speed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The others also quickened their speed toward the ground, preparing to meet up with the people from their branch bloodline families first and then discuss the plan to catch Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, all of them fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They quickly checked the surroundings for traces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Satan's Eye, the dim jungle became bright and clear in their eyes, and every tiny trace could be seen clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Those are the traces left by Osborne. He should have fled to the east." Someone whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No. There are also traces left by Osborne to the west. He might have gone west." Someone else said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was stunned and then sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne deliberately left traces to mislead us? Did he forget that his emblem would soon send out a signal and we would locate him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We don't have to follow the traces he left behind. We just need to wait for the emblem to send out a signal and locate his position. Then we can chase after him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone stopped there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They began to call people from their branch bloodlines and asked them to come together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">None of them noticed that at this moment, 33 feet underground beneath their feet, Osborne was restraining his aura, looking for an opportunity to attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who should I deal with first?"</p></div>
