        <h1>Chapter 2641 Primordial Energy-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So as long as I clear twenty-seven levels in one go, I can get a second chance! I can wait until my cultivation level reaches Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, or even Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, to enter the Celestial Spire again and continue from the twenty-eighth level onward..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was thrilled. This news was incredibly important to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, to him, the Celestial Spire was simply a treasure trove, a place where he could gain endless rewards as long as he was strong enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next time before I come in, I must figure out what the most precious treasures in the cosmos are and exchange for all of them!" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now he still faced a tough question&mdash;what exactly to exchange for with so many battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne asked, "Can the low-grade Imperial Artifact battle armor I exchange from you allow me to freely traverse the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign is a shortcut to deeper parts of the cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign is filled with terrifying Chrono-Spatial Turbulence. Anyone who hasn't reached Imperial Empyrean Sacredness entering the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign is almost certain to die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, anyone wanting to venture deeper into the cosmos must at least reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But on the Racial Convergence Planet, no Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior has appeared for tens of thousands of years! Otherwise, Frederick wouldn't have gone to such lengths to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket, seeking power from the Skyfall Casket to break through and become an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, though confident in himself, also worries he might not break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby replied, "Wearing the low-grade Imperial Artifact armor, you can naturally enter the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign without worrying about issues! But at most, you can only reach the middle layers of the cosmos. If you want to go deeper into the cosmos, this is far from enough..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was pleasantly surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being able to enter the middle layers of the cosmos was already quite good. If he couldn't break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness in the future, he would wear the low-grade Imperial Artifact armor, enter the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, and reach the middle layers of the cosmos!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rules in the middle layers of the cosmos are different from those at the edges. The rules there are more complete, making it easier to break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne made up his mind. "Then help me exchange for ten, no, twenty low-grade Imperial Artifact armors! I want Panoply Armor..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne not only wanted to prepare for himself but also for Clarissa and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Twenty should be enough!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twenty low-grade Imperial Artifact armors? No problem! Exchanging one requires 10 billion battle points! Twenty would be 200 billion battle points..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's battle points decreased by 200 billion, but he still had nearly 3 trillion left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He simply couldn't spend all his battle points!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne straightforwardly said, "Get me three mid-grade Imperial Artifact armors and one top-grade Imperial Artifact armor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "No problem!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One top-grade Imperial Artifact armor costs 1 trillion battle points! Three mid-grade Imperial Artifact armors cost 300 billion battle points. Now you have 1.63 trillion battle points left!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are still plenty of battle points left!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne helplessly said, "Get me forty low-grade Imperial Artifacts. Half for attack and half for defense! Among them, three sword-type Imperial Artifacts, three blade-type Imperial Artifacts, two..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne exchanged another forty low-grade Imperial Artifacts, spending another 200 billion battle points!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are still plenty of battle points left!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne thought of something and couldn't help but ask, "Can you exchange for Primordial Energy here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial Energy only exists in the Chaotic World before the cosmos was born.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Osborne consumed the Perfect Dragon Elixir, entered a special Enlightenment State, accidentally stepped into a Chaotic World, and unexpectedly absorbed a trace of Primordial Energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Primordial was incredibly envious of this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that Primordial Energy must be a treasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after he finished speaking, he noticed Toby was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "You actually know about Primordial Energy?"</span></p></div>
