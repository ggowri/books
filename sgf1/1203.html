        <h1>Chapter 1202 The Envy of Everyone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using interdimensional travel, Osborne swiftly returned to Newport City, the </span><span>Augustine Estate, accompanied by members of Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending the Blood Demon members back to their base, he led Anastasia and Zoe to the high-level conference room of the Augustine family, where they found his grandfather, Sebastian, already waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, Wesson, Bryce, and Greyson were also present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're back!" Sebastian exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bowed slightly in respect for Sebastian before nodding at the others. He noticed the tension etched on their faces; it was clear that something significant was weighing on their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze finally landed on Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Bryce, you've started refining your Divine Bone and Divine Flesh, gearing up to forge your Divine Body and break through to the divine realm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's surprise was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Bryce has only recently broken through to Class S, and now he is already at the pinnacle of Class S? He is moving faster than even Grandpa has."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce beamed at the compliment, his pride shining through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course! Who do you think I am? I'm Bryce, a super genius! Give me a month, and I'll have my Divine Body forged. No more being a mere mortal; I'll be a god!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His boast was met with envious glances from Matthew, Wesson, and Greyson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's talent was indeed something to admire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian watched Bryce with a mix of admiration and introspection. He had also begun refining his Divine Bone and Divine Flesh, but Bryce was clearly outpacing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If everything went according to plan, Sebastian would be about two weeks behind Bryce in forging his Divine Body and achieving the status of a divine warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't envy Bryce's talent; his own grandson, Osborne, had a far greater potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's expression shifted as he turned to Osborne, his eyes widening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's going on with your aura? It feels like you've made some significant progress in just a few days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Sebastian's words, everyone's attention turned to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could sense the subtle yet powerful energy radiating from him, and their expressions shifted to one of astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, then let his aura flow freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a transparent Ethereal Glow enveloped him, revealing the unmistakable presence of a Junior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an overwhelming force, vast and potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A palpable pressure settled over the room, making it hard for even Bryce and Sebastian, who were both refining their Divine Bone and Divine Flesh, to breathe. Their faces paled in the face of Osborne's immense energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you've broken through to the divine realm!" Sebastian was the first to react, his voice a mixture of excitement and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of Osborne's aura was far beyond that of Class S; only a divine warrior could possess such power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this even possible? Just three days ago, when you woke up, you were still a top-tier Class S. How could you have forged your Divine Body and achieved the divine realm in such a short time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's shock was evident, his mind racing to comprehend the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile crept onto Osborne's face. It had only taken him three days to forge a Divine Body, an astonishing feat considering that it usually required several months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those with exceptional talent typically needed two to three months to achieve such a transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Sebastian and Bryce, for example; they were confident they could craft their Divine Bodies in under two months, but that was their limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, returning after a mere three days, already standing at the threshold of divinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Well, during my time away, I encountered some unique opportunities that allowed me to forge my Divine Body so quickly. I'm officially a Junior Deity now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent as everyone processed Osborne's admission. The gravity of his words left them in stunned disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce, who had been so proud just moments ago, now stared at Osborne with a mix of admiration and confusion, his earlier bravado deflated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce had always prided himself on his talent, convinced he would be among the first in the world to break through to the divine realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, standing next to Osborne, he felt like a complete joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of taking just over a month to forge his Divine Body suddenly seemed laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had done it in three days! More precisely, less than three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During those three days, Osborne had been busy tackling the Beast Tide, dealing with Cain, and hunting down Dark Exotic Beasts and the Dark Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer magnitude of Osborne's achievements left Bryce feeling small and inadequate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's laughter rang out, bright and infectious. He couldn't contain his joy; Osborne's breakthrough filled him with pride. After all, this was his grandson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, his voice rising with excitement, "Osborne, good job!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a little while ago, we were worried sick about Rosmandi and Newport City facing a terrifying Beast Tide. We feared we wouldn't be able to hold our ground against those monstrous Dark Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, we're talking about warriors of the divine realm here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you've broken through, we can breathe a little easier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relief in the room was palpable. The tension that had gripped everyone began to dissipate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The recent attacks on Yalynch's Lafier City, Marcelin's Harbino City, Ransford's Denferes City, and Easionand's Mayano City had left them all on edge. Millions had </span><span>fallen to the Dark Deities during those brutal onslaughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fear that Newport City might be next had loomed large in their minds.</span></p></div>
