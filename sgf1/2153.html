        <h1>Chapter 2142 I Swear I Will Kill You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore's attack was lightning-fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne had managed to divert Isidore's attention momentarily, he didn't get far before the offensive was hurtling toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne had anticipated this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gripping tightly in his hands was the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow&mdash;a longbow as deep crimson as fresh blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just any bow; it had been enhanced to an astounding degree, having </span><span>absorbed a thousand pieces of Azure Ore, bringing it to a level of power rarely seen in this cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It might not have reached the status of a Sacred Artifact yet, but it was certainly one of the most formidable Apex divine artifacts around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, Osborne had mastered the Blood Fusion Technique, making the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow feel like an extension of his very body. This bond allowed him to unleash the bow's full potential with remarkable ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had yet to put its power to the test in combat, but confidence surged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was certain that if he channeled Sacred Power into the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, any single arrow's destructive force would rival that of his ultimate technique&mdash;Dimensional Maw!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination fueling him, he poured every ounce of Sacred Power into the bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, ten ominous, glowing red arrows appeared, each radiating an aura of sheer strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break through!" Osborne roared, pivoting swiftly as he released the bowstring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten arrows shot forward with terrifying speed, colliding violently with Isidore's oncoming attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Explosions erupted in a furious display of power as the crimson arrows struck, detonating one after another. Although Isidore's attack couldn't be shattered completely, each arrow dampened a portion of its potency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a series of cataclysmic explosions, the barrage of ten arrows crumbled into nothingness. Yet, by then, Isidore's once-insurmountable attack had lost the majority of its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It still struck Osborne with force, but it lacked the capacity to end his life. Instead, the residual energy propelled him closer to the cave entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! Empyrean Sacredness is way too powerful!" Osborne cursed, gritting his teeth as he fought against the pain coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his full-strength barrage had reduced Isidore's attack by over ninety percent, that last bit of leftover force nearly sent him flying out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least I've got an Infinite Sacred Body! I might not be able to wield my physical strength to its full potential yet due to my cultivation level, but it's still tough enough to keep me alive! Otherwise, I would've been done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was pale, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, but he pushed through the agony, racing toward the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait... what?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore couldn't hide his surprise, looking at Osborne's back in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still alive?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those ten arrows managed to cut my attack's power down by ninety percent!? Even an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King wouldn't find that easy!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a monster you are!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you keep escaping death like this, I might just lose sleep! But remember, even if you withstand my attack once, what will happen if I strike again? You can't unleash such power repeatedly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isidore's gaze fell on the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, a gleam of excitement </span><span>flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a bow! That kind of energy means it's practically a semi-Sacred Artifact! Just shy of becoming a real Sacred Artifact! You're wasting its potential in your hands!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, I will take that bow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Isidore launched forward once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop trying to escape! There's no chance for you! Just accept your fate and die here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying light shot forth, and Isidore's attack surged toward Osborne and Alfreda in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were now less than half a mile from escaping the cave and returning to the surface, but that distance felt like an insurmountable chasm at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to stop Isidore's strike; otherwise, they wouldn't stand a chance at survival!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda!" Osborne called out, desperation creeping into his voice as he turned to her, seeking hope in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda offered him a reassuring smile. "Don't worry, leave it to me!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you just focus on surviving! When you get stronger, you have to take down that old bastard for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could process her words, Alfreda suddenly appeared behind him, and a chill gripped Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words sent a wave of dread crashing over him. Confusion turned to horror as he realized what she might mean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought with a pale face, "Does Alfreda think she's going to die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why else would she ask me to avenge her? No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, what are you doing?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said you had a trump card to stop Isidore's attack! What's going on?" he shouted, reaching out in a futile attempt to grasp her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfreda merely smiled gently, slipping out of his reach. With a swift motion, she placed her palm against his chest, propelling him toward the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm sorry! I lied to you!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have any </span><span>trumpcard</span><span> that can block Isidore's attack. I'm just too weak while he's far too powerful! But I know this is the only way.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it better for one person to die than two? </span><span>So</span><span> I lied to you!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can only use my life to shield you from this attack! You must live! You have to grow strong enough to become the greatest in this cosmos, and then avenge me!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne... I'm so glad to have met you. Goodbye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After her heartfelt goodbye, Alfreda turned to face Isidore's impending onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Luminous Elven Wings appeared behind her, radiating a chaotic energy that whispered of an imminent explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is she going to self-destruct? No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face drained of color as sheer panic set in. He tried to stop her, but the power he had expended with the ten arrows left him utterly drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only watch helplessly as the air around her became more and more volatile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Alfreda!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, stop! Don't do this!" Osborne cried, his voice rising in a mixture of fear and rage, but it fell on deaf ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that very instant, Alfreda's body, along with the Luminous Elven Wings behind her, exploded violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouted, "Osborne! Live!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you ever meet my parents, tell them I'm so sorry for everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cataclysmic explosion erupted, the shockwave flinging Osborne out of the cave and back to the safety of the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But joy eluded him; his heart was heavy as he witnessed Alfreda's form dissipate in the fiery aftermath of her sacrifice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury ignited within him, and he clenched his fists with bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seething rage reached a boiling point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!!" Osborne's anguished scream split the air as he looked toward the cave, shaking violently with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isidore! I, Osborne Augustine, swear I will kill you!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't over! Ahh!!"</span></p></div>
