        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, in his hands, the Dragon Binding Rope can unleash its greatest power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He exchanged nine billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints for the Dragon Binding Rope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne put away the Dragon Binding Rope and immediately breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, all his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were completely spent, leaving none remaining. He used these points to exchange for Michelle's two relics, the ring and token, as well as three Supreme Sacred Artifacts: Domain Suppression Stele, Sacred Turtle Mountain, and Dragon Binding Rope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This harvest can be considered quite substantial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt very satisfied at this moment. His only regret was not yet finding Michelle's other relic, the necklace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Next, I must carefully observe the Royal Family members to find out who has my mother's necklace relic. No matter which member has it, I must find a way to take it back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They are not worthy of possessing my mother's relics!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A trace of determination flashed in Osborne's eyes. He glanced around. The two-hour time limit was about to end, with less than ten minutes remaining.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Clara and Leroy. "Have Clara and Leroy completed the exchange?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They still seemed to be undecided, discussing something while standing in front of a Sacred Artifact, but eventually decided to take it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, there wasn't much time left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the two of them also looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara asked, "Osborne, have you made your choice?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "All set! I've used up all my Kingdom Duel Scorepoints."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We are too," Clara said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of them had 24 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints and selected two Supreme Sacred Artifacts, one for attack and one for defense, greatly enhancing their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if they break through to Empyrean Sacredness in the future, they will no longer lack Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keep in mind, many Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors don't have a Supreme Sacred Artifact, yet they, not even at Empyrean Sacredness, already possess two.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All of this was brought to them by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Osborne's help, they likely wouldn't have stood out in Zephyr State's state duel, let alone participate in the zone duel or the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Osborne's help, they couldn't have tied with Osborne for the championship in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and gained so many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, their fate was completely changed because of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Let's go, let's head out first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although powerful Sacred Artifacts can quickly enhance our strength, the most important thing is to improve our own abilities! Moreover, mastering a powerful Sacred Artifact is no easy task. If mishandled, it could backfire and cause problems."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two nodded seriously, the joy on their faces gradually fading, especially Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy had been backfired by the Inferno Drake Lance before. She was well aware of the dangers of being backfired by a Sacred Artifact. Even though her strength was greater now, mastering a Supreme Sacred Artifact was still no easy task, and the slightest mistake could lead to a backlash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, they still had the Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Legendary Dragon Elixir would help them quickly master the Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne and the other two left the Royal Treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other contestants also walked out one after another, their faces full of excitement. The numerous Sacred Artifacts in the Royal Treasury had broadened their horizons, and they had exchanged for Sacred Artifacts suitable for them, enhancing their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aiden said, "Alright, everyone, head back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please don't leave Nebula City these two days. In two days, the guards will take you to the Palace again and lead you to a place of opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please refrain from breaking through your cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, you won't be able to go to the place of opportunity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Aiden finished speaking, he led everyone out of the Palace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of Osborne returned to the hotel and immediately began cultivating. Even Osborne used the hundredfold Time Acceleration, fully dedicating himself to cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two days later, they will head to Necropolis City!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During these two days, he must master the three newly acquired Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once he masters these three Supreme Sacred Artifacts, his strength will increase, allowing him to survive better in Necropolis City and disrupt Frederick's plans.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he also needs to study Michelle's relics.</span></p></div>
