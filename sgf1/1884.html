        <h1>Chapter 1883 Trick Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor didn't want to waste any time talking, so he decided to act immediately to avoid any potential complications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" Osborne interjected. "If you kill me, Kurt will certainly die too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne maintained a calm demeanor as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor frowned and halted his hand mid-motion. Above Osborne's head, a massive ice blade formed entirely of ice crystals was poised to strike. With just a thought, Trevor could make it plunge down and eliminate Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident that no one at the highest Divine King Level could withstand such an attack. Death would be inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow and asked, "What do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a faint smile. "Trevor, you've prepared a backup plan, but do you really think I haven't made my own preparations? I captured Kurt and held him for an entire day! Since I'm willing to make a deal with you, I've certainly thought through what to do in case I find myself in a tight spot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was scrambling to concoct a story to buy himself more time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "Honestly, Kurt is poisoned. The moment I die, he will die too. If you don't believe me, check his body. This poison is intertwined with his soul. Even a Supernal Deity King like yourself, even with the Miracle Elixir, wouldn't be able to save him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he were saved, he would end up a fool!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this soul poison can only be cured by me. If you want your son to die or become a fool, feel free to take your chances."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Osborne shrugged nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent Kurt's face into a panic, and he glared at Osborne with fury. "Damn it! You poisoned me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor frowned. "Do you really think you can trick me like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Whether I'm lying or not, you can find out for yourself. This shouldn't be too difficult for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's expression grew serious. He snorted and pressed firmly on Kurt's head to examine his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, his face darkened as he realized there was something wrong with Kurt's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, because the Soul Current Ocean was both important and delicate, Trevor was hesitant to probe too deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Osborne, furious. "Damn it! What kind of poison did you give Kurt to throw his Soul Current Ocean into such disarray?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I've hit Kurt with my Psychic Blast three times. How could his Soul Current Ocean not be in chaos?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he said, "That's my unique soul poison. The moment I die, his Soul Current Ocean will collapse! Even if you have the skills to save him, he will still end up a fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne appeared confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His calmness and assurance made Trevor even more inclined to believe him, while Kurt turned pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, save me! I don't want to die! I don't want to be a fool! Please, you have to save me!" Kurt shouted in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Trevor snapped angrily, turning his glare back to Osborne. "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, "I simply want to leave here alive. If you let me go by deactivating the formation, I'll give you the antidote and guarantee your son's survival. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor sneered at this. "Not a chance! You have spatial powers. If I deactivate the Universe-Sealing Formation, you could just slip away in an instant. Even as a Supernal Deity King, it would be hard for me to stop you without preparation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you escape, how will I ever find you again? If you give me the antidote first and return my things, I might consider sparing your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "How can I trust that you won't just turn on me after I give you the antidote? Your promises mean bullshit to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor snorted coldly and fell silent, knowing that the discussion was pointless. Neither of them trusted the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought quickly; he knew he couldn't expect Trevor to deactivate the Universe-Sealing Formation first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If things dragged on, it would only work against him. Trevor was currently anxious, but once he calmed down, his strength would allow him to uncover that Kurt wasn't poisoned at all, and Osborne's lies would be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne proposed, "How about this? Let's each make a concession. You tell me how you knew my real body was still nearby, swear on your cultivation that you won't kill me, and I'll give you the antidote!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you disagree, then we'll fight to the death! Your son and I will die together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne looked resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor snorted, his face showing signs of hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Kurt was frantic. He pleaded, "Dad, I don't want to die! We can deal with this bastard anytime, but we need the antidote first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Annoyed by the commotion, Trevor finally relented. "Fine!"</span></p></div>
