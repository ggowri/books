        <h1>Chapter 1291 The Final Card in the Hand</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We implore the elders! We implore the clan leader to return!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voices of over 10 thousand members of the Deschanel Clan rose in a fervent chorus, their eyes shining with a mix of hope and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each shout was filled with sincerity, echoing through the air like a desperate prayer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the forefront, Rachel was almost frantic, her pleas unending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood all too well how unreasonable her demands were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rules of this world were incomplete, and if the elders and the patriarch of the Deschanel Clan were to awaken now, they would only regain their Transcendent Deity status at best. Reaching their former peak would be ten times more difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the grand scheme of the Deschanel Clan, the elders and the patriarch were not meant to awaken prematurely. They had awakened Rachel in hopes that she could swiftly take control of Blue Planet, identify the problems in this new world, and find solutions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she couldn't resolve the issues, they aimed to discover a way to escape this flawed realm and lead them to a place where the rules were whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, they could rest in the Sanctuary Casket, restoring their powers to their zenith before awakening again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Rachel had messed everything up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their conflict with the Augustine family, they had lost three Transcendent Deities and seventeen Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was more than half of the Deschanel Clan's current strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the Augustine family attacking, they were in no position to defend themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation surged within Rachel as she called out again, "We implore the elders! We implore the clan leader to return!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled with urgency; she could feel the approach of the Augustine family's forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Transcendent Deities she had sent to hold them off had barely delayed their advance before being severely injured by the God of Star. In a brutal display of power, Osborne and the God of Star had teamed up, leading to the explosion of his Divine Body&mdash;he was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne and his allies hovered ominously above the Deschanel Clan's sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We implore the elders! We implore the clan leader to return!" Rachel cried out once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the Sanctuary Caskets before her began to tremble violently, waves of immense power erupting from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All twenty-eight of the Sanctuary Caskets shook in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel's heart raced with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd of Deschanel Clan members erupted into cheers, their voices rising in fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome back, ancestors! Welcome back, ancestors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous boom, the lids of the last twenty-eight Sanctuary Caskets blasted open, and powerful figures emerged, standing tall and imposing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were etched with fury as they fixed their angry gazes upon Rachel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trembling, Rachel pressed herself against the ground, too afraid to look up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachel, do you understand your sins?" A towering figure stepped forward, his voice cold and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above his head floated six blue Divine Flames, though two of them remained dim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a Level Six Divine Body, a super warrior who had once reached the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Terrence, the patriarch of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence loomed over Rachel, his eyes piercing into her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachel, you have deeply disappointed me! Do you have any idea what it means to awaken us prematurely and pull us out of the Sanctuary Casket?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel trembled, her voice barely a whisper. "I know I was wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the Deschanel Clan is at a critical juncture. I couldn't hold them off any longer; I had no choice but to plead for your awakening, great patriarch, and the elders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence cursed under his breath, "Useless! I had such high hopes for you, but I was clearly blind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't even handle a simple task. You've screwed up our entire plan. You deserve to die for this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of your incompetence, I and the rest of the elders are going to have to exert ten times the effort just to have a shot at regaining our peak strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And even then, we might never fully recover!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, the anger of the Deschanel Clan elders behind him was palpable, their eyes fixed on Rachel with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above their heads, each bore five Divine Flames&mdash;a symbol of their past status as Celestial Deity warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, one of the flames was dim, signifying they had only recovered the strength of Transcendent Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty-eight of them meant twenty-eight Transcendent Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Terrence Deschanel, Rachel has indeed made a grievous error, but there will be time to deal with her later. Right now, we must focus on resolving the external threat!" an elder interjected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence snorted and nodded. "Rachel, you've disappointed me greatly. But first, I'll deal with the intruders. Once that's settled, I'll deal with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he clamped his hands behind his back, his face set in an arrogant sneer as he strode confidently out of the shelter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come, everyone. Let me see who dares to attack the Deschanel Clan! Whoever they are, they're as good as dead today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Terrence marched out of the sanctuary.</span></p></div>
