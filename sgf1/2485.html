        <h1>Chapter 2389 Abyssal Planet-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne listened to the discussions around him and couldn't help but sneer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't believe these people would truly see him as a public enemy or go all out against him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone here is a genius from the various states of Eastern Zone 3, not fools, so they wouldn't act so impulsively. Even if Valentino came to trouble him, he was probably just trying to show off his special status.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If someone really wanted him to deliberately cause trouble for Osborne, he definitely wouldn't do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, this is a treasure hunt. Everyone needs to seize every moment to search for resources and treasures, leaving no time to target others&mdash;unless they completely don't care about achieving any results.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, no matter what, Osborne is the champion of Zephyr State. Even though almost everyone thinks it's impossible for him to win, they must admit that Osborne's strength is absolutely among the top, if not the best, in their group.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, in the top ten betting pools set by Phantom Commerce Guild, Osborne's odds rank within the top twenty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among those present, few are confident in dealing with Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they are filled with righteous indignation, eager to label Osborne as their common enemy, probably just hoping others will target Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That way, they would have one less competitor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for themselves, unless they happen to encounter him, they definitely won't deliberately seek out Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne didn't really care about becoming the common enemy of all the contestants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the saying goes, in the face of absolute strength, all targeting is meaningless. Actually, the Phantom Commerce Guild's casino has a saying that's quite true...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne indeed didn't take these people present seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His goal is to dominate everyone effortlessly with absolute strength and win the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Silence!" A stern shout suddenly rang out, followed by a blurred figure appearing before everyone. He sat on a grand and towering throne, floating in mid-air, looking down on the crowd from above.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am the chief referee for this zone duel. My name is Gerald. Now, I will take you to the Cosmic Translocator. In one hour, the zone duel will officially begin."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Gerald waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A force enveloped the thousand contestants present. Everyone felt a blur in their vision and had already left Crescentia, arriving in its outskirts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, an enormous Cosmic Translocator appeared before them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such a massive Cosmic Translocator?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was extremely astonished and thought, "It seems the zone </span><span>duel</span><span> battlefield is indeed not on the Racial Convergence Planet but on a planet incredibly far away from it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne looked at Gerald again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald gave off an incredibly intimidating vibe. When Osborne looked at him, it felt like staring at a blazing sun, almost impossible to face directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "He must have reached the level of an Empyrean Sacredness supreme warrior, but I wonder if it's Lesser Perfection or Great Perfection."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked into the distance again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, near the Cosmic Translocator, there was a viewing platform. Below it, countless spectators were gathered densely, likely numbering in the billions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the viewing platform, there were quite a few people as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every spectator was incredibly powerful; only those who had at least reached Empyrean Sacredness could step onto the viewing platform.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly glanced around but didn&rsquo;t spot Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Ms. Olsen said Ms. Alba would personally come to watch, but I haven't seen her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had originally wanted to ask Adriana about Isa, Clarissa, and Anastasia, as it had been almost half a year since they last met, and Osborne missed them a bit.</span></p></div>
