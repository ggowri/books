        <h1>Chapter 1988 Before the Competition</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's voice roared across the battlefield, powerful enough to send shivers through every warrior present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, a stunningly beautiful projection appeared before him&mdash;It was the God of Light. Her serene demeanor and striking features captivated everyone on both sides, leaving them momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice broke the silence, calm yet unwavering. "Of course! Since the day your Paramount Supreme Clan invaded Celestara, we in the Human Community have been preparing for this final showdown. Let's settle our grievances once and for all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Icy One couldn't help but chuckle, a low, menacing sound that echoed across the field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you want to settle things, huh? Just as I'd hoped! But before we dive into that, why don't we start with the little game we agreed upon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The border competition is about to begin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The warriors of the Dark Deity Legion are itching to spill the blood of your so-called geniuses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that proclamation, a bloodthirsty gleam lit up Icy One's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words ignited a frenzy among the ranks of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air erupted with their cacophonous chants of "Kill! Kill! Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was deafening, a wave of lethal intent that seemed to shake the very foundations of Celestara. Each word dripped with chilling malice that sent a wave of dread through the Human Community coalition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt the oppressive weight of the Dark Deity's murderous aura, and for a moment, it seemed to paralyze them with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't matter if they were Transcendent Deities, Celestial Deities, or even Deity Overlords&mdash;they all felt the prickling sensation of terror clawing at their resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the Deity Kings among them could bear the pressure slightly better, yet even they wore gravely serious expressions, sensing the storm about to break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" The God of Light's crisp voice cut through the chaos like a knife, clear and resounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It drowned out the roars of the 50 billion Dark Deity Legion warriors, leaving them momentarily breathless, as though the air had been knocked from their lungs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the warriors of the Human Community began to feel a measure of relief. They looked up at the projection of the God of Light, feeling a surge of faith coursing through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was their unwavering support, their beacon of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she stood among them, they were not defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would not perish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that electrifying moment, countless Human Community warriors felt a rush of energy ignite within them&mdash;an overwhelming urge to unleash their pent-up emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They raised their voices in a resounding battle cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight! Fight! Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, it was just a handful of them joining in, but gradually, the fervor spread to all corners of the coalition. Together, they reverently gazed at the God of Light and shouted, their battle spirit soaring higher and higher, driving away the shadows of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were eager to charge forward and vanquish the Dark Deity Legion once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight! Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thunderous battle cries from the Human Community sent shockwaves through Celestara, causing the very ground to tremble. This time, it was the Dark Deity Legion that faltered, their faces betraying a flicker of confusion&mdash;and even fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their overwhelming numbers, more than five times that of the Human Community, they felt like tiny boats tossed about in a raging sea, vulnerable to being capsized at any moment, with no one around to rescue them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the morale of the Dark Deity Legion plummeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's expression darkened, his features twisting into a mask of fury and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! Well played, God of Light! But don't think this little trick will sway the outcome of the war! Let's skip the games and get down to brass tacks&mdash;let's fight for real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light smirked, a hint of disdain dancing on her lips. "Wasn't it you who started these games?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want a fight, then let's have one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In half an hour, the first border competition will officially begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sweeping gesture, the God of Light summoned a colossal platform that erupted from the ground between the two forces, shaking the very heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It loomed like a mountain, its flat summit stretching over 300 miles in length and width.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's voice rang out, firm and unyielding. "This is the arena for the border competition!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In thirty minutes, ten thousand of our Transcendent Deity warriors will take to this stage to battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot a cold glance at Icy One before her projection vanished, leaving behind an air of tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Icy One scoffed at the towering platform, his expression darkening with a mix of anger and unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In half an hour, it'll be the Dark Deity Legion spilling blood here! We'll see who comes out on top!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he spoke with bravado, Icy One couldn't shake the feeling that he had lost this round against the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he brushed it off; after all, he knew her strength far surpassed his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could single-handedly take her on, there would be no need for the Nine Dark Sovereigns to band together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One muttered to himself, a smirk creeping onto his face, "The real outcome of this war won't be decided by you or me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait until your Human Community loses the challenge. Let's see how high and mighty you'll be then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy One's projection flickered out, leaving the battlefield in a heavy silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were glued to the immense platform, anticipation building for the impending border competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While this contest wouldn't determine the war's ultimate fate, it would give everyone a clearer picture of the balance of power between the Human Community and the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement buzzed in the air as everyone awaited the showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the Sanctum of Light, the atmosphere was electric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the leaders of the eighteen Dukedom Level Powers, many prominent figures from top-tier factions had been invited by the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds gathered in the grand hall, their gazes fixed reverently on the Radiant Throne where she sat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She announced, her tone calm yet commanding, "Today's eight border competitions have their rosters finalized. I've carefully selected these participants based on the lists and information you provided, ensuring that we secure as many victories as possible on this first day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a look at the names, and if anyone has objections, speak up now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, eight shimmering panels materialized before her, each displaying a dense list of names.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lists included 10 thousand warriors for the Transcendent Deity, Celestial Deity, Deity Overlord, and Deity King level matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Ascension One, Two, and Three Supernal Deity King contests, one hundred warriors were listed, while only ten were chosen for the Ascension Four Supernal Deity King battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room buzzed with energy as everyone leaned in to examine the names.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, nods of approval rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have no objections!" one leader declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The warriors on this list are the finest talents in our Human Community. Among their cultivation levels, they are undoubtedly the strongest! With them in the arena, I believe we can bring home victory!" another added, his voice brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! We will triumph!" The chorus of agreement swelled, filling the hall with a renewed sense of hope and determination.</span></p></div>
