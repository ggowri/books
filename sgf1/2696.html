        <h1>Chapter 2570 Provocation-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for everyone else, no matter their faction, they couldn't possibly be their match and could only compete for the tenth place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the nine of them stepped out, murmurs began to spread among the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone said, "Emperor Frederick cares a lot about this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. He actually let all nine princes and princesses participate. This has never happened before."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the past, some princes or princesses would join the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel for fun, but usually, only one prince or princess would participate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, those princes and princesses won the championship every time. This time, with nine princes and princesses participating in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, it has directly raised the level of the event. Unfortunately, with them around, no one else has a chance to win the championship and can only compete for the tenth place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These discussions reached the ears of the nine princes and princesses, instantly making them show confident and proud expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They exchanged glances, their eyes full of fighting spirit, as they only saw each other as opponents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They completely disregarded the hundred contestants who emerged from the zone duel, believing these participants were unworthy of being their opponents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A prince looked at Seraphina and said calmly, "Seraphina, the day has finally come."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For this day, we have waited for hundreds of years and suppressed our cultivation level for centuries. People say you are the number one on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, stronger than us. But we refuse to accept it and want to challenge you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The champion of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel might not be you. Be careful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is Emiliano, slightly older than Seraphina. However, on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, he is ranked behind Seraphina, in second place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, he was not convinced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina glanced at him, her beautiful face full of confidence. "I will be the champion. Emiliano, you can't stop me. None of you can stop me. If you don't believe it, then try me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, Emiliano's face turned a bit grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other princes and princesses also looked a bit upset, feeling that Seraphina had belittled them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seraphina, you're too confident," Matthew, ranked third on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, said coldly. "The rankings mean nothing. It doesn't guarantee you'll be the champion. If we do face each other, I won't hold back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly. The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings don't determine the final results. Otherwise, there'd be no need to hold the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel; they could just hand you the championship," Rosalie, ranked fourth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, said defiantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have no thoughts about the championship, just want to stay in the top five," said Yunus Augustine, the prince ranked fifth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My thoughts are simpler. It doesn't matter who the champion is, but it must be one of us nine. Since we're competing, we must win the championship. If an outsider takes it, all of us will lose face," said Sean Augustine, the prince ranked sixth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is that possible? Those losers aren't worthy of competing with us for the championship. Forget the championship, they don't even stand a chance of making the top five," said Jasmine Augustine, the princess ranked seventh on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, disdainfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jasmine is right. However, I think your words are a bit conservative. Since the nine of us are competing, the top nine must be dominated by us. Otherwise, whoever gets kicked out of the top nine will be the sinner who brings shame to the Royal Family," said Miles Augustine, the prince ranked eighth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, with a proud expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Yvonne Augustine, the princess ranked ninth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, said calmly, "The dignity and pride of the Royal Family depend on us. With so many watching, if any one of us loses, the entire Royal Family will be humiliated."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, we must do our best to teach those losers from the zone duel a harsh lesson."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, the eyes of the nine were filled with mockery and indifference.</span></p></div>
