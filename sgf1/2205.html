        <h1>Chapter 2189 One Arrow-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zayne, don't worry! This guy has no idea what he's getting into&mdash;he thinks he can challenge you? Hahaha, he's not even in your league! I can take care of him with ease!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ricky strode confidently toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, human! I've heard you're the most talented of the younger generation on Celestara Planet. No wonder you're so cocky! But you've picked the wrong opponent; Zayne's already reached Ascension Ten. He'd find it embarrassing to bully you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let me handle you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky then gestured for Osborne to come forward. "I won't be unfair. I'll let you shoot three arrows at me first! If you can break through my defenses, I might even consider playing with you for real. Otherwise, you're not worth my effort!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ricky surrounded himself with a divine power barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King, he was confident he could handle Osborne easily. He simply set up a layer of divine power around him and stopped there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered at the spectacle. "Let me fire three arrows at you? That's a waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One arrow will be more than sufficient to take you down! And I'd advise you to put up a proper defense; otherwise, what's left of you might be nothing more than half a mangled corpse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intentionally leaked a trace of his energy signature, letting Ricky get a sense of his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had used the Sublime Concealment Orb to disguise and distort his energy, making Ricky perceive him as an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Six?!" Ricky blinked in surprise, then let out a scornful scoff, a look of pure disdain spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those who knew Osborne well were left utterly flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Six?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne has reached Ascension Six? How is that even </span><span>poss</span><span>ible? Just a month ago, he was only at Ascension One! He vanishes for a month and returns as an Ascension Six cultivator?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's simply inconceivable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he consume a Sacred Elixir? Even so, it's completely unrealistic to leap from Ascension One to Ascension Six in just a single month!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was abuzz with disbelief, but Ricky couldn't have cared less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you've reached Ascension Six? Big deal. You're still nothing but a speck of dust in my eyes! No matter how gifted you are, an Ascension Six cultivator stands no chance against me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk! I said you could shoot three arrows, so fire away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his fingers provocatively once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "If you're so eager to meet your end, I'm more than happy to oblige!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he drew an arrow on his Bloodwrought Bow and aimed it straight at Ricky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Ricky sensed something was horribly wrong. A cold shiver ran up his spine, and a wave of overwhelming dread washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had already boasted so much; there was no turning back now. He quickly bolstered his divine power defenses and even activated two Apex divine artifacts to shield himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After fortifying his defenses, he finally felt a bit more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The earlier sense of impending doom had been incredibly intense, and it irritated him to no end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, boy! Once you've shot your three arrows, I'll squash you like a bug!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold chuckle. "Like I said, I don't need three arrows to end you. One will do the trick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he decided to stop dilly-dallying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was well aware that if he didn't showcase some real might, the warriors around him wouldn't take him seriously. After all, he was still a youngling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could have used the Sublime Concealment Orb to make it seem like he was at Ascension Eight, Nine, or even Ten. But after some careful consideration, he concluded that it wasn't worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Appearing as an Ascension Six warrior while actually being at Ascension Four was more than sufficient for the moment.</span></p></div>
