        <h1>Chapter 2223 Phantom Commerce Guild-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft's face was ashen, the seal on his powers combined with his severe injuries rendering him no different from an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that any further struggle would be futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Bancroft began to speak, "Before I say anything else, let me warn you that the backer I'm connected to is not someone you want to mess with. </span><span>There are very few people in the entire Racial Convergence Stellar Region who would dare to cross him! You think nobody notices our slave trading? Think again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plenty of people are aware of the irregularities, but none have the guts to investigate. That's because my backer wields immense power..." A flash of pride glimmered in Bancroft's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, interrupting, "Enough with the games! Just tell me who he is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft hesitated for a moment, then replied, "His name is Scottie Lillard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The guy I deal with directly is always called Scottie. Whenever he needs slaves, he contacts me directly and tells me to prepare them. Once I'm ready, I notify him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Bancroft had finished speaking, he fixed his gaze on Osborne's face, his expression earnest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow. "Scottie? What faction does he belong to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a derisive laugh, Bancroft answered, "Phantom Commerce Guild!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phantom Commerce Guild?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression paled dramatically, realization dawning upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe it&mdash;the one orchestrating slave trading for the Phantom Tide Demon Sect was associated with the Phantom Commerce Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This could spell real trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft sneered and said, "I see you know of the Phantom Commerce Guild!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that makes this easier. Now that you're aware of the backing I have, just let me go and return my slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for your little incident with my son, let's pretend that never happened. But those slaves are mine, or else you're going to have a world of trouble when the Phantom Commerce Guild comes after you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Messing with the Phantom Commerce Guild's assets won't end well for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's frown grew even deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, standing close by, looked worried. "Osborne, what's going on? Just how powerful is this Phantom Commerce Guild?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused for a moment, then finally nodded. "It's not just strong; it's incredibly powerful! You could say it's at the very top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Phantom Commerce Guild is one of the most top-notch forces on the Racial Convergence Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Racial Convergence Planet is huge&mdash;way bigger than Celestara Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compared to it, Celestara is just a tiny little world. The Racial Convergence Planet is the only really important large-scale life planet in this area!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On the Racial Convergence Planet, there are countless powerful factions, each one a force to be reckoned with, holding a candle to the Phantom Tide Demon Sect. In fact, the Phantom Tide Demon Sect would be considered a Piddling Power on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are three top-tier </span><span>Powers</span><span> on the planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are the </span><span>Evernight Court</span><span>, the Glorious Divine Kingdom, and the Phantom Commerce Guild."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened a bit when he mentioned the Glorious Divine Kingdom. After all, it was his homeland, and he was the son of the kingdom's ruler; he'd once been a prince.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly pulled himself together and carried on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although there are countless factions on the Racial Convergence Planet, these three are the most powerful. Together, they control more than half of the planet's territory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Evernight Court has the largest expanse of land and the most power. Next comes the Glorious Divine Kingdom, which also ranks second in terms of territory. The Phantom Commerce Guild may have a smaller territory, but its influence and strength are comparable to those of both the Evernight Court and the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p></div>
