        <h1>Chapter 2245 Advancing to the Top Twenty-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that's what I'm talking about! But unfortunately for </span><span>you</span><span> lot, your strength is no match for mine. You might as well just sit back and watch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he let go of the bowstring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten arrows of divine power rocketed forward at a terrifying speed, each one homing in on its intended target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos erupted in the arena as Osborne's assault began, and the fight was about to kick up a notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying explosion rocked the arena as the ten fighters unleashed their attacks. Their assaults collided with Osborne's divine power arrows, resulting in a deafening roar before the chaos burst apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force of the arrows tore right through the fighters' defenses, frozen expressions of shock etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They erupted backward, blood spewing from their mouths as they flew off the platform, discarded like ragdolls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had already stowed away his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to the referee at the edge of the arena, a seasoned Elder and Empyrean Sacredness warrior, and asked, "So, can you declare me the winner now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elder, still trying to grasp what had just unfolded, regained his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked intensely at Osborne, a mix of awe and respect in his eyes. "You did exceptionally well! Peak Seven... are they about to rise again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a nod, he announced, "I declare the winner of Group Five is Peak Seven's Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne smiled modestly and turned to leave, onlookers were left in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combat was erupting across ten different platforms, but Group Five had already determined its victor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected this&mdash;one person defeating all thirteen of his opponents in a single match, decisively claiming victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of dominance had never been seen before in the history of the Sect Tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A dark horse has emerged!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Group Five has a real dark horse! One draw of the bow and he took out all his opponents! He even loosed ten arrows at once and defeated them in a flash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable! This is insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's absolutely a dark horse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People started cheering and hollering in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They realized that despite Group Five being seen as the underdog, it had produced a fearsome competitor. The news spread like wildfire, luring more and more onlookers as they got wind of what had transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those left </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span> were Angela from Peak Seven and several other Elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had completely glossed over what was happening in Group Five until the referee declared Osborne the winner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They whipped their heads around, jaws dropping in utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them didn't even know who Osborne was&mdash;only Angela and Earvin recognized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's eyes bugged out in shock.</span><br><span>Wait, it's him?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has he really reached Ascension Eight? But he's just newly minted. Moreover, he was up against thirteen Ascension Ten warriors, and he just wiped the floor with them to make it into the top twenty?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments earlier, she'd been worried that Peak Seven would come away empty-handed again, maybe not even get a single person into the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had blown her expectations out of the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the first one from his group to advance, firmly securing his place among the top twenty elites!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, even Bethan, another heavy-hitter, hadn't wrapped up her match yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela furrowed her brow, a blend of worry and admiration creasing her forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I can't believe how incredibly talented and powerful he is! In retrospect, it all falls into place. Isa, Clarissa, Anastasia, and the others are all amazingly gifted fighters, and their leader is... Osborne!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If Osborne wasn't up to par, how could he possibly lead such a bunch of prodigies?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile started to spread across Angela's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But, well, his cultivation level is still a bit on the low side. Group Five is relatively weak. Sure, he might have used his quasi-Sacred Artifact to get out of the group, but he'll definitely have a tough time against the big guns like Vadim, Jamar, and Bethan. If he runs into them, he won't stand a chance!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Otherwise, he might just knock our socks off.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I'm really hoping he can make it into the top ten. If he manages that, I won't feel like such a flop as the Peak Lord of Peak Seven!</span><span>"</span></p></div>
