        <h1>Chapter 2092 Element Gold Crystal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, most of the exploration teams had wrapped up their discussions and were setting off again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those wanting to leave Umbra Earth were in the minority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this was a precious and rare medium-sized continent. Many had drifted through deep space for thousands of years without ever having the chance to step onto Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that they had finally arrived, how could they leave empty-handed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the six thousand, fewer than one in ten opted to depart. They remained on the platform, planning to team up and navigate the Death Chasm together before making their exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest plunged into the depths of the chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Death Chasm resembled a vast spiderweb, a network of cracks sprawling across the dark purple terrain. The intricate branches twisted and turned, forming a natural maze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One particularly large fissure stretched out into the distance, having been thoroughly explored by the Elf Race before, with all dangers cleared and treasures collected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they followed this main path, they would reach the next platform and be able to use the Spatial Translocator to leave Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne and his team had their sights set on the smaller, unexplored branches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew where these paths led; they remained untouched and shrouded in mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne walked cautiously through one of the narrow fissures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfrey's mechanical eye glowed red as it scanned the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called out, "Ms. Rivera, this branch shows no signs of prior exploration. It's clear that no one has been here before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded in acknowledgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, Godfrey! Everyone, stay sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fact that this branch hasn't been explored means everything is unknown. We could run into danger at any moment..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group nodded in agreement, gripping their weapons tightly as they cautiously surveyed their surroundings, moving at a slow pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne had drawn his Bloodwrought Bow, holding it ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Death Chasm, a sense of unease settled over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he stepped in, he felt an oppressive weight, as if countless malevolent eyes were watching their every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he activated his Satan's Eye, nothing unusual appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surroundings were eerily calm&mdash;no sign of the Phantom Worms or Soulreaver Vines that Uriel had warned them about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a vast, desolate chasm filled with dark purple rocks and patches of crimson moss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, that unsettling feeling kept Osborne on high alert. He continued to sweep the area with his Satan's Eye, prepared for any sudden threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the group had covered over 60 miles without encountering anything of note.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chasm was devoid of life, just the same purple stones and the dark red moss clinging to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This lack of danger made Alfreda and the others start to relax a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It doesn't seem as dangerous here as Uriel said," she murmured, leading the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being the strongest in the group, she took the lead, flanked by Godfrey and Hermione, their formation resembling an arrowhead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly and Cyrus, brought up the rear, while Osborne and Avery were sandwiched in the middle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hermione asked, "Ms. Rivera, are we sure this was the right branch to choose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no danger here, and it looks like there aren't any treasures either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda spoke up, "This is just the beginning! Let's push deeper. If we don't find anything in the next 60 miles, we can turn back and choose another branch of the chasm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne interjected, "Wait! I can sense the presence of lightning elemental energy&mdash;it's incredibly strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to him, curiosity and surprise lighting their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pointed ahead, saying, "It's about 12 miles that way! The elemental power fluctuations are intense&mdash;it must be... Element Gold Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I think there are quite a few of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His excitement was palpable. After hours of exploration in Umbra Earth, he finally felt the allure of a treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Element Gold Crystals were known to enhance elemental power, and Osborne had once acquired a Spatial Gold Crystal that had propelled his space elemental essence from Level Nine early stage to late stage&mdash;a massive leap that left his lightning and dark elemental essences in the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Element Gold Crystals filled him with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he finally detected its presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Element Gold Crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twelve miles away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda, Avery, and the others gasped in disbelief, staring at Osborne as he shared his revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They focused intently, trying to sense it themselves, but found nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The skies above Umbra Earth were perpetually lit with flashes of ominous lightning, filling every corner with a terrible energy that muddled their own senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at six miles or three miles out, they couldn't detect anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Osborne with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you're not mistaken? You can sense Element Gold Crystals 12 miles away?" Alfreda asked, her brow furrowed in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was of a far higher caliber as an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King and, being a Nature Elf herself, she was adept at sensing energies, even more so than many in their rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet she couldn't pick up on anything from that distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda thought, "How could Osborne possibly do so? Is his sensitivity to energy sharper than mine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied confidently, "Whether I'm mistaken or not, we can find out by checking it out! It's only 12 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! If we're late, someone else might grab them first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he dashed forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, wait! Let me lead&mdash;you're too low in rank to handle any potential danger..." Alfreda hurried to catch up, positioning herself protectively in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warmth spread through Osborne at her concern, but he realized she still didn't fully trust his abilities. Rather than argue, he followed quietly behind her as they swiftly moved deeper into the fissure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, they covered about six miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alfreda's expression shifted, a bright excitement replacing her previous composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exclaimed, "I can sense it now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The elemental energy is thick and complex&mdash;it's definitely Element Gold Crystal! And there's a lot of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words ignited a surge of excitement within the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weren't they risking everything in this dangerous Umbra Earth for the very treasures they sought?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Element Gold Crystals were undoubtedly invaluable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move! Pick up the pace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they pressed on, they covered another three miles, and even Beverly and Godfrey began to register the energy from three miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thrill coursed through everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There must be at least ten Element Gold Crystals!"</span></p></div>
