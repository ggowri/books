        <h1>Chapter 1815 Preparing to Leave</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly rifled through Hubery's memories, but the sheer complexity made it hard to pinpoint the secret he had mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, he decided it was time to leave this place behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their next destination?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's about time I checked out the West Zone," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was the territory controlled by the Human Community, and despite spending so long in Celestara, he had yet to see it for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current situation at the West Zone's borders was tense, with various rebel factions clashing against the Dark Deity Legion. In the past, Osborne had felt that his own power was insufficient to make a difference there. He believed it was better to stay in the East Zone and develop his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he sensed it was time to lend a hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than that, a heavy weight had settled in his heart&mdash;a troubling thought that wouldn't let him be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne needed to understand the relationship between Isa and the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Isa's timeline, they had been apart for over twenty years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two decades ago, she had bid him farewell, leaving Blue Planet for Celestara, where she quickly rose to prominence as a renowned powerhouse of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her rise was partly due to her strength; she had held her own against one of Lord Malevolence's Nine Dark Sovereigns, a formidable opponent named Icy Six, even managing to injure him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But more than that, it was her identity that drew attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was the disciple of the God of Night, and she boldly claimed to be his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne first heard this news, it felt like the ground had dropped out from under him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled with the thought that Isa might have betrayed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, Osborne wanted to believe in her. He couldn't fathom that she would abandon him for the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the whispers echoed throughout Celestara, making it hard to dismiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined to uncover the truth, he resolved to travel to the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Isa had truly turned her back on him and was with the God of Night, then all he could do was wish her well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip, feeling a sharp pang in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed aside the turmoil roiling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Clarissa, Emma, and Austin? I hope they're doing alright. What's their situation now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile crept onto his face at the thought of the women he cared for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been far too long since they had parted ways, and he couldn't wait to reunite with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, another face flashed through his mind&mdash;Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of her sent a chill down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Time! She must be in the West Zone, hiding somewhere to regain her strength. Otherwise, with her power and status, her presence would cause a stir throughout Celestara. The fact that I haven't heard of her return means she's still not fully recovered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that realization, fury ignited in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would never forget how the God of Time had nearly killed him in the dimensional portal. If it hadn't been for Ophelia's soul intervening, he might have been dead long before reaching Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the God of Time had sealed Ophelia's soul and manipulated the spatial tide, putting him in a situation where he almost perished. If not for his immortal body, he would have been done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Osborne had nearly lost himself in the depths of space, wasting twenty years of his life, almost trapped forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One thing was clear, Osborne had a score to settle with the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This grudge has been etched in my mind! God of Time, mark my words&mdash;I will have my revenge! You better hope I don't find you, or I swear I'll beat you to a pulp and seal your soul! I'll free Ophelia's soul!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought hanging heavily in the air, Osborne took a deep breath, trying to steady himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to make one last stop at Wild Flame City, then we'll head to the West Zone!" he announced to Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all nodded in agreement, quickly making their way into Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, Osborne activated his interdimensional travel, and in the blink of an eye, he found himself standing in the heart of Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had reached the peak of the early Deity King stage, so his interdimensional travel range had expanded to over six million miles. The journey from Divine Peak Nine to Wild Flame City was now a breeze, requiring just a single jump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood within Spark Estate, surveying the familiar surroundings, when Darren approached him with a respectful nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne returned the gesture with a nod of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Betty and her two sisters joined them, their faces brightening at the sight of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!" Betty exclaimed, her voice filled with warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled back, pleased to see how well Spark of Blaze had been thriving. The organization had rapidly evolved, drawing in many strong members from the Human Community and establishing itself as a major player in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, his tone shifting to one of seriousness, "I'm leaving the East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darren and the others will be coming with me. From now on, I'm handing over Spark of Blaze to you, Betty. You'll be in charge. I'll make sure to leave you with enough resources to help you grow and strengthen the organization."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne pulled out a Dimensional Bag.</span></p></div>
