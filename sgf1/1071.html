        <h1>Chapter 1070 Run Away</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The authoritative voice came, resonating with an undeniable tone that commanded respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to know who I am. All you need to understand is that I promised a certain kid I'd protect his family while he's away, so you can leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice belonged to none other than the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep within the dungeon beneath Challenge Peak, his ethereal form flickered, showing signs of weakness as his soul-based body trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That earlier strike had seemed effortless, sending Gerardo reeling. If he hadn't held back, Gerardo would already be dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, it wasn't that the God of Star didn't want to continue attacking; he simply couldn't muster the strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the blow that had severely injured Gerardo had been a desperate move, executed with sheer willpower in a moment of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the God of Star attempted the same kind of attack again, he would undoubtedly fail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, for now, he had to feign strength in hopes of intimidating Gerardo into retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, his strategy failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's expression warped with fury. "You want me to walk away? Not a chance! If you've got the guts, kill me! But if I'm reading the situation right, you're not capable of that, are you? If you could, you wouldn't let me off the hook so easily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold laugh, he continued, "Let me take a wild guess. You're not even human, are you? You're a 'living god'! That's why your words drip with disdain for someone like me, a top-tier Class S. But let's be real; your power hasn't been at its peak for ages, has it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence blanketed the area after his proclamation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star remained silent, but his lack of response only confirmed Gerardo's suspicions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Living god? Ha! I've faced plenty of dead gods, but a living one? That's a first! If you're going to stand in my way of wiping out the Augustine family, then I might as well start with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm killing a god today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With manic resolve gleaming in his eyes, Gerardo charged toward Challenge Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong and Sin exchanged glances, tension etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong said tersely, "Looks like Gerardo hit the nail on the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're dealing with a god who's managed to survive from ancient times. He might be wounded, barely clinging to life, which explains his current weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's our plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin scoffed, saying, "Honestly, I don't care about any of that! I just want to wipe out everyone connected to Osborne and personally take his head as a tribute to my deceased wife and daughter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for this ancient god? Let Gerardo deal with him! You can't possibly be thinking of stepping in, right? You League of Divine Descent folks might like to think you're the descendants of the gods, but you don't truly believe every god is one of your forebears, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong shrugged almost nonchalantly. "Not a chance. We've got our own ancestral gods. We only worship them! Any other gods are just wild ones, powerful 'cultivators' if you will. We couldn't care less about their fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chilling laugh, Armstrong continued, "Let Gerardo take on that weakened god! Sure, he may be damaged, but it won't be a walk in the park for Gerardo to kill him. Gerardo might end up heavily injured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if that happens, we could leverage the situation to force him into giving us more benefits&mdash;maybe even the rights to mine more rare metals from Rosmandi!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong wore a look that suggested he couldn't wait to watch the spectacle unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the God of Star let out a cold snort, his irritation palpable. Gerardo's taunts had clearly struck a nerve, igniting a fierce anger within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't know much, do you? You think you can kill me? That's downright laughable! You're just a top-tier Lesser God, and you think you're worthy of taking me down? Even in my weakened state, you don't stand a chance against me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's settle this once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden surge of energy pulsed through the air, and in an instant, a blinding white light erupted from Challenge Peak. It expanded like a colossal orb, enveloping the entire Augustine Estate and even reaching out to Armstrong, Sin, and the others who had retreated outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone felt an overwhelming sensation wash over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong exclaimed, his body tensing up, disbelief etched across his face, "This is the Light Realm! A Level Five Light Realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He can still wield a Level Five Light Realm! That's a power only gods can control!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's he planning? Does he want to wipe us all out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear flickered in Armstrong's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, a realization struck him. "Wait! This isn't a complete Level Five Light Realm! His power is definitely not at its peak! This kind of Light Realm can't kill us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star responded, his voice now tinged with weakness, "True, it won't kill you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's more than enough to trap you for a while! Listen closely, all you members of the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, run away! Fast!"</span></p></div>
