        <h1>Chapter 2682 Control-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May seemed a bit anxious. "Osborne, what nonsense are you talking about? I have no idea about any eerie forest, let alone being trapped in it. You said branches pierced my vital points?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you think Ms. Alba will believe you? Look at me! My body wasn't pierced at all. I'm perfectly fine! I don't know why you're making this up, but it's ridiculous."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May kept denying it, looking extremely agitated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the more May acted like this, the more Osborne was certain something was wrong with her. However, Osborne couldn't pinpoint exactly what the issue was. May was indeed still alive and still the same May as before, even her memories and way of speaking were identical.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, there was definitely something wrong with her!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmly said, "May, do you think I'm making this up? Then would you dare let Adriana check your body? If I've wronged you, Adriana will naturally clear your name after the examination. By then, I'll apologize to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, May's expression suddenly turned even colder. She angrily said, "She wants to check my body? On what grounds? Just because you suspect me? I was the one who raised Ms. Alba. For so many years, I&rsquo;ve cared for and helped Ms. Alba wholeheartedly. Just because of your suspicion, she has to check my body? I don&rsquo;t agree!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May looked at Adriana. "Ms. Alba, if you doubt me because of Osborne's words and think there's something wrong with me, you can just kill me. Living has no meaning for me anymore. I might as well die early and go see your parents."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Adriana immediately showed a guilty expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne sneered and thought, "She's actually starting to play tricks, using past feelings to sway Adriana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was now almost certain that something was wrong with May. The more May refused to let others examine her, the more Osborne wanted to check her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "Adriana, if you don't want to do it yourself, you can step out for a moment. I'll check her. If I ultimately fail to find any evidence against her, I'll compensate her with a hundred emperor fruits. I think, if May is truly innocent, a hundred emperor fruits should be enough to make up for it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, May's face changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Adriana nodded. "May, cooperate with Osborne. As long as it proves you're innocent, you'll get a hundred emperor fruits. You might even become a warrior at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level, gaining extended longevity once again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isn't this a good thing for you? If you refuse again, I can only suspect you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, May fell silent, her face looking terrible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Adriana almost believed Osborne's words. She couldn't help feeling a bit uncomfortable, but finally, she just sighed and said, "Osborne, I'll leave her to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The only thing I can be sure of is that this body indeed belongs to May. So, please don't harm this body."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Alright. I understand."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Adriana disappeared from the Ice Crystal Hall. Instantly, only Osborne and May were left in the Ice Crystal Hall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at May and said calmly, "May, will you let me check willingly, or do you plan to resist?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May's expression instantly turned ferocious. "You're courting death! You're just an outsider. Even if Ms. Alba invited you to be the Honorary Elder of the Fairy Moon Sect, your status in the Fairy Moon Sect is still beneath mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You actually dare to doubt me and even try to sow discord between me and Ms. Alba? You must have bad intentions. So, I will kill you now to prevent you from harming Ms. Alba and the Fairy Moon Sect."</span></p></div>
