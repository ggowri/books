        <h1>Chapter 2098 What a Haul!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne broke through Level Nine, the ascent of his elemental essence slowed to a crawl. Even the blue Miracle Elixirs he had were proving ineffective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without some extraordinary treasures, he would need to rely on the passage of time to continue his growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, time was a luxury he didn't have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, luck was on his side. On their very first day in Umbra Earth, they had stumbled upon the Element Gold Crystals, and Osborne had been assigned three of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the energy from those three crystals was being rapidly absorbed by his elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, a wave of intense pain hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having previously absorbed a Spatial Gold Crystal, Osborne was familiar with this kind of agony. Still, he couldn't help but let out a low roar as the pain coursed through him, shaking his body more violently than any physical injury he had ever endured. It was a hundred times worse than being torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as he felt his dark, space, and lightning elemental essences surging upward, he reassured himself that all this suffering would be worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First to break through was the dark elemental essence, followed closely by the space elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tremendous energy swirled around Osborne, building in intensity for three long hours before it finally began to settle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he opened his eyes, a spark of determination ignited within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've absorbed all three Element Gold Crystals! My strength has finally increased! But... the boost seems less significant than I expected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, his brow furrowed in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lightning and dark elemental essences had indeed reached the late Level Nine as anticipated, granting him a high degree of mastery over both powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his space elemental essence had only barely climbed from late Level Nine to the peak of Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hadn't surged all the way to Level Ten as he had hoped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still far from achieving that goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? The effect of this Spatial Gold Crystal seems significantly weaker than the last one. At this rate, I'll need several more Spatial Gold Crystals&mdash;maybe even a dozen&mdash;to elevate my space elemental essence to Level Ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization weighed heavily on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Element Gold Crystals were incredibly precious, and even in Umbra Earth, acquiring them wasn't easy. Where would he find so many Spatial Gold Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it! I'll just do my best! At least reaching the peak of Level Nine for my space elemental essence gives me a solid boost. Now, if I can channel spatial energy to draw upon the Bloodwrought Bow, I could easily take out an Ascension Four Phantom Worm with a single arrow! Even an Ascension Five Phantom Worm would be severely injured or even killed by my spatial arrows!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, a smile crept back onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elevation of his space elemental essence not only raised his attack ceiling but also made his Spatial Clone significantly stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Clone?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a spark of inspiration ignited in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't I think of this sooner? I could send my Spatial Clone to scout the Death Chasm for me! There are countless branches here; with just Alfreda and me, even if we spent a month exploring, we'd only cover a fraction of the chasms. But my Spatial Clone can explore on my behalf!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement bubbled within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Spatial Clone could harness the power of his space elemental essence and utilize Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye, the clone could detect dangers ahead, allowing it to avoid any lurking Phantom Worms and vastly improve its exploration efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If others could explore just one branch of the chasm, Osborne could send out over two hundred Spatial Clones, allowing him to scout more than two hundred branches&mdash;and possibly even more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His efficiency would skyrocket by several hundred times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this exhilarating thought racing through his mind, Osborne sprang to his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa! You finished absorbing the Element Gold Crystal already?" Alfreda looked at him, her eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was no ordinary crystal; each Element Gold Crystal contained an immense and pure source of elemental essence power. Alfreda recalled the time she absorbed a Plant Gold Crystal&mdash;it had taken her an entire day to finish it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even then, her speed had been extraordinary, far exceeding that of others at her cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, whose cultivation level was significantly lower than hers, completing the absorption of an Element Gold Crystal in just three hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she not be astonished?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she knew he had absorbed three at once, her jaw would have dropped even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Was it fast? I've had some practice with this before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Alfreda nodded, a flicker of understanding dawning on her. "So you've absorbed Element Gold Crystals before! That would definitely speed things up! The first time you absorb one, it's the most effective; after that, the benefits start to diminish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on a sec. I want to absorb one too and boost my power a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure! I'll keep watch for you!" Osborne replied, ready to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda quickly settled into a meditative state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she was focused, Osborne activated Satan's Eye to scan the surroundings for any potential threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he confirmed it was safe, he began his own preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzzing sounds filled the air as multiple Spatial Clones began to materialize around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Level Eight Spatial Clones, Osborne could create up to two hundred and fifty-six of them simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dismissed the clones in other locations, concentrating all his efforts on forming the full two hundred and fifty-six Spatial Clones within Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, everyone! Go out there and explore every branch of the chasm!" he commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if responding to a rallying cry, the army of Spatial Clones surged forward, diving into the depths of the Death Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four hours later, all the clones returned to the main chasm, each having found an unexplored branch to investigate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sat cross-legged, his mind flooded with the perspectives of his two-hundred-plus clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Clone Nine has encountered a Phantom Worm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Good thing I can use interdimensional travel to bypass the Phantom Worm's territory and continue deeper!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clone Eighteen ran into another exploration team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This branch has already been explored. Retreat quickly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clone One Hundred Fifty-Six found a massive, multicolored stone! Using Satan's Eye's X-ray vision, it detected fifteen Element Gold Crystals inside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart soared with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few hours, one of his many exploring Spatial Clones had stumbled upon fifteen Element Gold Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a haul!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ecstatic&mdash;his strategy was proving to be remarkably effective. Even though he couldn't fly or use spatial powers to traverse through the rocks and soil of Umbra Earth, his connected Spatial Clones were doing the work for him, uncovering hidden treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over two hundred Spatial Clones, Osborne's efficiency in exploring the Death Chasm had skyrocketed by several hundred times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barely had to lift a finger; his clones were doing all the heavy lifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, other Spatial Clones began reporting their own discoveries.</span></p></div>
