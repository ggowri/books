        <h1>Chapter 2287 Throw Down the Gauntlet-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, good, good!" Conrad thundered, his voice booming with barely-contained rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, Osborne was nothing but a pesky mosquito buzzing around a grizzly bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did a grizzly back down from a mosquito? Hell no!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Osborne with a look that could kill, his eyes narrowed to slits, and hissed, "You said it yourself, pal! Since you're so eager to meet your maker, I'll be more than happy to oblige. Once we hit the state duel combat zone, we'll pick a spot. And if you don't show up, you're a yellow-bellied coward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll let you breathe for a couple more days! Make the most of your last few moments in this world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Conrad upped his pace and hightailed it out of there with Malcolm and the rest of his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just before taking off, Malcolm shot Osborne another menacing throat-slitting gesture that sent shivers down the spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold snort, his eyes blazing with a fierce, homicidal glint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Conrad and his gang had vanished from sight, the crowd that had been gathered around, realizing there was no more action to gawk at, gave Osborne a long, hard look. Then they started shuffling away, muttering to themselves as they went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Osborne is as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's only ranked 108th, and he's got the nerve to rile up Conrad! Conrad's not just a badass on his own, but he's also got four top-100 teammates in his corner! Even those top-notch geniuses ranked in the top ten wouldn't be stupid enough to mess with Conrad's crew. They'd probably steer clear of them like the plague! But Osborne just marched right up and provoked him, even threw down the gauntlet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's got a death wish, plain and simple!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, he's probably gone off the deep end! I mean, he was the big shot, the champion of Tempest Fortress City. But then he comes to the state duel and finds out there are over a hundred folks who can out-muscle him. He couldn't even crack the top 100 on the strength leaderboard. Anybody'd be seething mad in his shoes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyhow, he's a goner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's hushed chatter reached Osborne's ears, but he just tuned them out like they were white noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara and Gustave eyed him with a mix of worry and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave furrowed his brow. "Osborne, you're really gonna go through with this duel against Conrad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a faint smile. "They're pushing me around. Am I supposed to tuck my tail and run? I don't go looking for fights, but I sure as hell ain't scared of them! Since I said yes to this duel, I'm in it all the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave's worry deepened. "But Conrad's no pushover! He's ranked 15th for a reason. He's got two Sacred Artifacts down pat! One's for offense and the other's for defense. With those two toys in his arsenal, he can even hold his own against those super-geniuses in the top ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even his four teammates are all in the top 100! Malcolm's sitting at 80th place, and the other three are even tougher nuts to crack, ranked anywhere between 50th and 80th. Put them all together, and they're hands-down one of the powerhouses in the state duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave fixed his gaze on Osborne, hoping he'd see reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, pride's a big deal, but sometimes, staying alive takes the cake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "I get it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave let out a sigh of relief, thinking Osborne had thrown in the towel on the duel with Conrad and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyways, I ain't too fond of that Malcolm either! If you cross paths with them in the state duel... just holler at me! I might not be able to go toe-to-toe with them, but I can still chip in a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile. "Appreciate it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the group reached the East Gate of the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex. A few hundred brawny warriors taking part in the state duel were already there, cooling their heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne and his mates showed up, a bunch of folks craned their necks to take a look and started whispering among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apparently, the news about Osborne's duel with Conrad had spread like wildfire. Almost everyone cast surprised and disdainful looks at Osborne, thinking he was just asking for trouble and digging his own grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't care less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started to sweep his eyes across the crowd, on the lookout for potential threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was a stir in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Benson's here! That's Benson, ranked fourth on the state duel strength leaderboard! He hails from a First-rate Power. He's a super genius who's managed to fuse three types of power..."</span></p></div>
