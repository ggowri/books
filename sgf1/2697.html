        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro Ramsey, an elderly man with white hair, quickly said, "Now, all participants, please come on stage for the group draw."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A total of 109 participants will be divided into ten groups, and each prince and princess as seeded players will not be placed in the same group."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each group will engage in a free-for-all. Teaming up to attack the same opponent is not allowed. In the end, the last person standing in the ring and the last one to lose the match will be the top two of the group, advancing to the top 20 together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The top 20 will draw lots again, with group winners facing other group runners-up. Losers will be eliminated, and winners will advance to the top 10."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The top 10 will draw lots again for elimination matches to determine the top 5."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The top 5 will all compete against each other, with each person playing four matches. The final champion, runner-up, and third place will be determined based on the number of victories."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The competition rules are actually simple, and the pace is quick. All battles must conclude within a day, directly determining the final champion."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"According to these rules, winning the championship only requires participating in one free-for-all, two elimination rounds, and four point matches."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne is very satisfied with these rules."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Compared to state duel and zone duel, he still prefers this simple arena battle. Strong is strong, weak is weak, with little element of luck."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If luck has to be involved, it can only be during the draw, using luck to get into a better group."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For example, if there are only nine princes and princesses competing but they need to be divided into ten groups, one group will inevitably have no prince or princess. Those in this group will definitely find it easier to make it into the top twenty."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, being in the same group as Seraphina, ranked first on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, is obviously different from being in the same group as Yvonne, ranked ninth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In short, there is some luck involved, but not much. To make it into the top ten, or even the top five, it ultimately depends on strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, the participants were all talking eagerly, each hoping to get into the group without a prince or princess, all hoping to make it into the top twenty."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, Osborne didn</span><span>'</span><span>t care. To him, which group he entered didn</span><span>'</span><span>t matter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if he was in the same group as Seraphina, Osborne firmly believed the first place in the group would be his."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, Osborne has always had good luck."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He was the last to step onto the stage to draw lots, and by then, everyone else had already drawn theirs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clara drew the ninth group, ending up in the same group as Yvonne, who ranked ninth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy had good luck and drew the tenth group. There were no princes or princesses in the tenth group, but Brenda was there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda sneered at this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy also sneered and looked at Osborne, who was the last to draw lots."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Actually, Osborne didn't need to draw lots anymore because his luck came into play once again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The first nine groups were full, and only the tenth group was missing one person. Unless there was a mistake in the drawing, he would definitely be in the tenth group with Leroy and Brenda."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure enough, Osborne ended up drawing the tenth group."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Our luck is pretty good," Osborne said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clara drew Yvonne, ranked ninth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, the weakest among the nine princes and princesses."</span></p></div>
