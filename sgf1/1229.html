        <h1>Chapter 1228 Divine Shadow</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared in shock at the pristine white orb cradled in Mila's tiny hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held it out toward him, her expression earnest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You saved me from the Deschanel Clan, so I want you to have this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated, a flicker of doubt crossing his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This gem looks anything but ordinary. Is she really just giving it to me? Doesn't that seem a bit reckless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does it do?" Osborne asked cautiously, trying to gauge its significance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila tilted her head, a look of confusion washing over her face. "Oh, right! What does it do? I think... I might have forgotten? All I remember is that my mom and dad called it a Sanctuary Gem, but the details are all fuzzy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave her head a little shake, a pained expression crossing her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if I can't remember, it's not a big deal. It's the only thing I have left, and I don't have anything else to thank you for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I guess you'll have to figure out what it does on your own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she tossed the gem toward Osborne casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He caught it, but to his surprise, it felt incredibly light as if it had no weight at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment eased his apprehension; after all, carrying something that weighed over a million pounds would be a burden for anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne examined the gem briefly, finding nothing amiss or particularly remarkable about it. He decided to pocket it for now, planning to investigate its properties later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his attention back to Mila. "Now that you're free, what are you going to do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila's brow furrowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know! So much is missing from my memory. It feels like I don't have any family left! I want to find my mom and dad, but I can't even remember who they are! I also want to find Ms. Divine Shadow, but where could she be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Divine Shadow?" Osborne murmured, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like Mila's memory was incomplete&mdash;though it was hard to tell if she was faking it or not. Still, the name "Ms. Divine Shadow" that slipped from her lips caught Osborne's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As far-fetched as his own thoughts seemed, he decided to probe a little further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is she a person?" Osborne asked, gazing at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? How did you know Ms. Divine Shadow isn't human? She's a divine beast! A beautiful tiger! Have you seen Ms. Divine Shadow before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hopeful gaze bore into him, and Osborne felt a pang of guilt for what he was about to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, if the Divine Shadow you're talking about is a tiger, then I haven't seen her. The only creature I've encountered named Divine Shadow was a cat..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words left his mouth, he realized he might have been mistaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, "The mysterious cat at the Augustine Estate&mdash;Divine Shadow&mdash;how could it possibly be related to Mila?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's from the Age of Gods!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her young age, she possesses the power of a Celestial Deity and a Level Six Divine Body. Even in the Age of Gods, her status must be incredibly high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she mentioned that her parents predicted Lord Malevolence's invasion before it even happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They dared to confront him to change the course of the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That means Mila's parents must be formidable figures&mdash;perhaps even Deity King warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So how could that lazy cat at the Augustine Estate be the same as the Ms. Divine Shadow she's talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Mila suddenly gasped, her excitement palpable as her cheeks flushed bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed Osborne's arm tightly, her eyes sparkling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mister, how do you know that Ms. Divine Shadow likes to shrink her form down to look like a cat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've seen her, haven't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is she? She's still alive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, take me to Ms. Divine Shadow! I miss her so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila's enthusiasm was overwhelming, her grip firm on his arm. Even if she hadn't regained her full strength, she was still an Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was saying something since she had a Level Six Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She might look like a little girl, but her power wasn't far off from Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mila's grip tightened, he sucked in a sharp breath, bracing against the pain shooting through his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, his mind raced with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could that mysterious cat from the Augustine Estate&mdash;Divine Shadow&mdash;really be the Ms. Divine Shadow she's talking about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either way, if I can get Mila to meet this Divine Shadow, everything will fall into place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly replied, "Yes, I've seen a cat named Divine Shadow. But I can't be certain it's your Ms. Divine Shadow! I can take you to meet her, but you need to let go of my arm. If you don't, my arm might just get mangled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, Mila's face flushed even more, a look of guilt passing over her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But... your arm seems fine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have a Waste Divine Body, don't you? How can you be this strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila gazed at him with awe, her eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not wanting to get into the specifics, Osborne waved it off. "Let's go! I'll take you to see Divine Shadow right now!"</span></p></div>
