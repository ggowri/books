        <h1>Chapter 2631 Clearing the Challenge-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's hard to say whether the difficulty has been lowered or increased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne has to face a hundred enemies at the same time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of his enemies has surpassed primary Empyrean Sacredness, and they are stronger than usual. Even if Seraphina joins forces with fifty-six others, defeating all the enemies within ten breaths won't be easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What happened next indeed confirmed Osborne's guess.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The great battle broke out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina dared not hold back much. She, along with the other princes and princesses, quickly dealt with the enemies in front of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two-thirds of the hundred enemies were dealt with by the six of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when the battle was over, they realized that twelve breaths had already passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since the time had exceeded ten breaths, each of them could only receive half of the maximum reward in battle points, which was five million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These rewards were already more than enough for them. After all, most of them had earned less than one million battle points in the rewards from the previous nine levels. However, now they easily gained five million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Seraphina and the other five were clearly dissatisfied, as they all wanted to get the highest reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this point, Seraphina could say no more and simply said, "We should cooperate better next time. With our strength, we can easily defeat the opponents within ten breaths. Our teamwork was too clumsy, and we interfered with each other, which led to mistakes and chaos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone nodded and didn&rsquo;t dare say anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go. We'll move on to the eleventh level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Seraphina and the others entered the eleventh level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and the other three quickly arrived at the tenth level's trial site.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are those a hundred projections of warriors who reached primary Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara frowned, "Could it be that their team has too many people? We have fewer members, so maybe our opponents will also be fewer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne felt it was unlikely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said nothing. Then, the four of them stepped into the beam of light together, ready for the trial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a hundred power projections appeared opposite them, all representing various Beast Clan creatures like fierce tigers, mighty lions, divine dragons, and phoenixes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Clara, Leroy, and Casey all took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There really are a hundred opponents!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter how many people are tested, the number of opponents is fixed, right? In that case, with only four of us, won't we be at a disadvantage?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey all frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's team had as many as fifty-six people, but Osborne's only had four. Facing a hundred opponents with fifty-six people versus just four is definitely a completely different situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each member of Seraphina's team only needed to face less than two opponents, but Osborne and the other three had to handle an average of twenty-five opponents each.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There&rsquo;s a disparity of over tenfold between the two teams.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;No wonder Princess Seraphina was so sure we&rsquo;d regret it. Turns out this is what our next challenge looks like&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey all looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. More people doesn&rsquo;t always mean better. Princess Seraphina&rsquo;s team previously became chaotic due to having too many members. They ultimately took over ten breaths of time to clear the challenge.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;We have fewer people, so it&rsquo;s actually easier to coordinate.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;As long as we&rsquo;re strong enough, even with just the four of us, we can still clear it.&rdquo;</span></p></div>
