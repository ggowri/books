        <h1>Chapter 2279 Power Rankings-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there were those who were a force to be reckoned with all on their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were like self-contained armies, carrying the legacy of various ancient and powerful bloodlines in their veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne really doesn't stand a chance against these guys! He's light-years behind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect held Osborne in high regard, they had to face the facts. The top ten on the state duel power rankings were absolute powerhouses, with abilities so formidable that Osborne couldn't hold a candle to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they turned their attention to the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's name was still missing. They didn't find it too surprising, though. The top twenty were also extraordinary beings. Each of them had awakened their Sacred Power ahead of time and managed to wield a Sacred Artifact in city duels without losing control or suffering a backlash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne must be in the top thirty, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They mumbled to themselves and kept scanning down the list. However, Osborne's name was still nowhere to be seen, and many started to furrow their brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still no sign of him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kept their eyes glued to the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 31st to 40th place&mdash;no Osborne in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 41st to 50th place&mdash;still nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 51st to 60th place&mdash;there was still no sign of him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, the disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect were in an uproar, their faces flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is going on? How can Osborne not even make it into the top sixty? What's the criteria for this ranking? I could understand if he wasn't in the top thirty, but not even the top sixty? That's just crazy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do the Zephyr State officials have any idea what they're doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Are they dissing our Mystic Sirius Sect? Are they looking down on Tempest Fortress City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a single contestant from Tempest Fortress City has made it onto the list so far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep looking! I'm gonna see how low those Zephyr State officials are gonna rank Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 61st to 70th place&mdash;zilch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 71st to 80th place&mdash;nada!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 81st to 90th place&mdash;still nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 91st to 100th place&mdash;zip!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, a contestant from Tempest Fortress City finally showed up on the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Leroy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[State Duel Power Ranking: 96th Place&mdash;Leroy!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Leroy comes from the Second-rate Power Azure Haven Academy. Although she was defeated by Osborne and Clara in the Tempest Fortress City duel, it was only because she lost control when using the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance. But in the end, she turned misfortune into a blessing and mastered the Inferno Drake Lance. Her current strength has surpassed Osborne and Clara. If she has enough allies in the state duel, she has a chance to enter the top hundred, or even aim for the top fifty!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect immediately started shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the deal? Leroy is just someone Osborne defeated. Why is her ranking higher than Osborne's? Osborne is the champion of Tempest Fortress City. How come he's not even in the top hundred?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they looking down on Tempest Fortress City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was incredibly angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, they spotted Osborne's name on the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[State Duel Power Ranking: 108th Place&mdash;Osborne!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explanation read: [Osborne is the champion of Tempest Fortress City. But Tempest Fortress City isn't that strong overall. Plus, Osborne's cultivation is only at the Ascension Eight level, the lowest among the thousand participants in the state duel. Sure, he has Sacred Power, but he's never shown off a Sacred Artifact. His attack power is solid, yet his combat techniques are rather basic. That's why we've ranked him 108th.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Given that he hails from the under-powered Mystic Sirius Sect, he won't have strong allies in the state duel. It's next to impossible for him to do well. Reaching the top hundred would be a stretch and would need a ton of luck!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Osborne's ranking and this evaluation, the whole Mystic Sirius Sect was ticked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was little they could do about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assessment made by the Zephyr State officials was fairly objective. After some careful thought, they found they had no grounds for argument and could only feel powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Those ranked above Osborne do seem to outmatch him, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Take Leroy, for example. If she fully masters the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance, could Osborne still come out on top in a rematch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It'd be an uphill battle!</span></p></div>
