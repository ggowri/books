        <h1>Chapter 2281 Out of Seclusion</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Osborne stepped out of his abode, Angela's voice rang in his mind. "Osborne, get your over here right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, since Angela lived nearby, she'd instantly caught wind that he'd ended his seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time and made his way straight to Angela's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, he was standing in front of Angela. Her eyes widened in astonishment as she exclaimed, "You've reached Ascension Nine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a faint smile and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela beamed with delight. "Brilliant! That's really great!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was a bit concerned about how you'd fare in the state duel, but now I'm feeling a lot better. Hitting Ascension Nine must have given your strength a huge leap. Even if you can't fight your way into the top ten in the state duel, you should definitely stand a good chance of making it into the top hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the very least, you won't end up making a complete fool of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span><br><span>Even though Ms. Olsen has no idea that I've fused a third power, which has given my Sacred Power a huge boost, my past achievements, along with my cultivation level at Ascension Nine, should have made her have more confidence in me, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But it seems that Angela only thinks I have a chance of scraping into the top hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That is kind of an insult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela seemed to sense Osborne's annoyance. She let out a little laugh. "You've been cooped up in seclusion and completely out of the loop. You haven't heard about the state duel power rankings released by the Zephyr State authorities, have you? Take a look first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Angela handed a document to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"State duel power rankings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow but kept quiet and quickly scanned through the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First place, Agatha! Second place, Horace! Third place, Broderick! Fourth place, Benson... Ninety-sixth place, Leroy... One hundred and eighth place, Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flipped through the rankings, a look of disbelief crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Zephyr State officials have actually placed me at one hundred and eighth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So they really don't think much of me, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are you feeling?" Angela asked with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne kept his cool. "I'm fine! The competition is tough, especially those four&mdash;Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson! Ms. Alba wasn't kidding. There really are people at the Supernal Deity King Level who can fuse three or even four powers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this is just the state duel. There are already four people who've fused three powers. That's pretty amazing! When it comes to the zone duel, won't there be hundreds of them who've fused three or even four powers?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! They're really strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne rambled on, Angela was left speechless for a moment. Looking at Osborne's dead-serious face, she almost blurted out that things weren't as he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even in the final Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel would there be anyone who had fused four powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Supernal Deity King Level, fusing three powers was the absolute limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, Angela bit her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that it? Any other thoughts? The Zephyr State officials ranked you 108th. What's your take? Are you steamed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "A bit miffed, sure! But it's all good. The final state duel results aren't set in stone by this ranking. We'll only find out once the battles are fought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela let out a little laugh. "Seems you're still full of confidence. That's the spirit! Now that you've reached Ascension Nine, I'd say you can leap at least twenty or thirty spots on the rankings. Your actual strength probably places you around 80th!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eightieth, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't show much of a reaction and couldn't be bothered to debate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela continued, "Don't think I'm looking down on you! This is my honest assessment. Almost everyone ranked above you has Sacred Power. You don't have an edge there. Most importantly, they all carry Sacred Artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, a major factor that helped you plow through the Sect Tournament and the city duel was your sheer offensive might. But on those arenas, defensive divine artifacts were off-limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The state duel is a whole new kettle of fish. Defensive divine artifacts are allowed now! Your offensive advantage is going to be blunted. You won't be able to just bulldoze your opponents like you did before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, getting the gist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breakthrough in Sacred Power was a stroke of luck. The might of his Sacred Power, now combined with three other powers, was in a league of its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, his Bloodwrought Bow had also leveled up and turned into a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if his opponents hunkered down behind defensive quasi-Sacred Artifacts or even full-fledged Sacred Artifacts, Osborne wasn't fazed in the slightest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if his opponents holed up like turtles, Osborne was dead-set on shattering their defenses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another thing is team-building."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela sighed, adding, "The Mystic Sirius Sect is at the bottom rung among Second-rate Powers, and Tempest Fortress City isn't exactly a heavyweight. You're going to have a tough time finding top-notch allies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "It's okay. No allies? That's fine. I'm not all by myself. I've already made arrangements with Clara from Fantasia Isle. I'll team up with her in the state duel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela nodded approvingly. "Clara from Fantasia Isle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's no slouch. Ranked 299th on the power list. She could be a real asset! Other than her, do you have any other folks in mind for your team?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head dismissively. "Nah! I'm good without them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela frowned in concern, asking, "How can you say that? Everyone around your ranking is going all out to form powerhouse teams. That's the only ticket to a shot at the top ten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a grin. "But I don't know anyone else. Teaming up with Bethan, Jamar, or those guys? It'd be a waste of time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela nodded understandingly. "That's exactly why I called you here. I wanted to lend a hand with this. Remember my fellow practitioners Amber, Keeley, and Gwen? They're out there honing their skills in different sects. Their sects also have disciples taking part in the state duel. Their rankings aren't off the charts, but a few are on par with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're interested, I can reach out to them and try to set up a team-up! But the profit-sharing is something you'll have to figure out yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Angela, feeling grateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, Osborne shook his head. "Thanks for the suggestion, Ms. Olsen, but I'm not keen on teaming up with strangers. I think having Clara on my team is sufficient. Adding more people? I'm not sure I can drag them all into the top ten..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela nearly choked and started coughing violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said you'd be the one dragging them into the top ten?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, do you even have that kind of clout? You're getting way ahead of yourself! The state duel is no walk in the park like the city duel. My lowest expectation for you is to make it into the top hundred! As for the top ten... you'd have to be insanely lucky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you think you can single-handedly pull others into the top ten?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shot Osborne a scathing look, thinking he was being overly conceited.</span></p></div>
