        <h1>Chapter 1259 Rapid Progress</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past two weeks, everything had been remarkably calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Osborne's cunning plan to divert trouble, the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League had engaged in a fierce battle that left both sides reeling from significant losses. During this time, both factions had kept a low profile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan had refrained from making any moves against the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, many members of Blood Demon had successfully forged their Divine Bodies and ascended to godhood, with nearly all of them achieving at least a Level Three Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every day saw more Blood Demon members breaking through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, Bryce, Anastasia, and others had long since forged their Divine Bodies and become Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength of the Augustine family was growing stronger by the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of the number of Junior Deities, Osborne believed that the Augustine family now outnumbered both the Deschanel Clan and the League of Divine Descent by a significant margin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was one glaring issue: the lack of high-tier combat power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was strong&mdash;capable of severely wounding a Superior Deity in a surprise attack&mdash;but killing one was a different story; it was almost impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was still just a Junior Deity himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League boasted Superior Deity-level warriors, with the potential for even more to emerge, including Transcendent Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne couldn't continue to grow stronger, having a multitude of Junior Deities wouldn't do the Augustine family much good in a showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, after tidying up various matters, Osborne resolved to focus on enhancing his own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had two main paths for advancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first was to find a way to elevate his status to Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt reasonably confident about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make the leap to Intermediate Deity, he would need a massive influx of energy. Given the strength of his Divine Body, the energy required for his breakthrough would be substantial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relying solely on his own absorption methods, it would take ages for him to reach Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had already devised a clever workaround: borrowing energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus was made entirely of energy, and its essence was even purer and more advanced than divine power. Just a tiny leak of its energy would be more than enough for Osborne to make the jump to Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Breath of Celestial at his disposal, Osborne could even siphon off core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus, allowing him to extract some regular energy without much fuss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he broke through to Intermediate Deity, his combat prowess would see a significant boost. Defeating or even killing a Superior Deity would become a far more attainable goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if he encountered a Transcendent Deity? He could always make a strategic retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, elevating himself to Intermediate Deity seemed like a more prudent choice than completing the third stage of fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True, completing that fusion would allow him to send the Lotus' roots into the bodies of Blood Demon members, granting them the resurrection benefit and transforming them into immortal warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surge in overall strength for the Blood Demon members would be astronomical&mdash;far beyond just tenfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fearless and death-defying members of the Blood Demon were an absolute nightmare for their enemies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mulled it over for a moment before making a decision. "I'll go for the elevation first! Right now, I'm not entirely sure I can complete the third stage of fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. But if I can break through to Intermediate Deity, my Divine Body will be even stronger, making it easier to achieve that fusion later on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having made his decision, Osborne sprang into action without a moment's delay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Breath of Celestial!" Osborne intoned, invoking the mystical technique to harness the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several attempts, he finally managed to extract a sliver of energy from the Lotus, which immediately threatened to overwhelm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single thread of energy felt like a tidal wave crashing through his veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurriedly began absorbing it, and as he did, his realm soared&mdash;from Junior Deity to Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This leap, which would typically take even the most prodigious talents years of arduous training, was now being accomplished in mere moments. Osborne's progress was nothing short of breathtaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time slipped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne inched closer to the Intermediate Deific threshold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in Hearin City, at the sanctuary of the Deschanel family, tens of thousands of clan members had gathered once more, their faces reflecting a profound reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their recent strides in cultivation had noticeably bolstered their strength. The number of Class S warriors had swelled, and an impressive thirty-plus individuals had even ascended to godhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joining these newly minted gods were Joseph and the seventeen other deities who had survived from the Age of Gods. The Deschanel family's roster of divine warriors now topped fifty, marking a remarkable ascent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, their strides paled in comparison to the meteoric rise of the Augustine family. The Augustine Bastion, blessed with a hundredfold more elemental energy, had propelled its clan&mdash;excluding the Blood Demon members&mdash;to surpass the Deschanel family's divine warrior count.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the Deschanel family remained unaware of this upsetting development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the solemnity, fifty-plus gods stood foremost, each exuding a solemn aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The time has come," Joseph declared, his voice steady as he bowed respectfully towards the sixty-three Sanctuary Caskets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We welcome the awakening of our forebears!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We welcome the awakening of our forebears!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan's people chanted in unison. The Sanctuary Caskets quaked, signaling the imminent awakening of their long-dormant ancestors.</span></p></div>
