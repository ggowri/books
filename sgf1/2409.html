        <h1>Chapter 2324 Accept the Situation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, there's a whole bunch of tough warriors closing in on us!" Clara cried out, her eyes popping wide as she peeked at her badge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart pounded with anxiety as she locked eyes with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy spoke up, nodding seriously, "Osborne, we gotta skedaddle from here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's just too many of them! Almost all the top thirty warriors and their squads are making a beeline for us. They think we're sitting ducks and are gunning to take us down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft laugh, completely unfazed by their fretfulness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax, let them come! The first layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm ain't that big. Even if we try to hightail it out of here, they'll end up cornering us sooner or later. So, we might as well stand our ground and fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether they can take us down easily depends on how good they really are! Besides, if we wanna snag a top-ten spot, we gotta face these challenges head-on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Clara and Leroy exchanged worried looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there's a boatload of them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shut his eyes and went quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara and Leroy glanced at each other and realized they had no other option but to put their faith in his call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the high scores they'd racked up were thanks to Osborne leading the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they didn't make it into the top ten, they could only blame their own lack of firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then it's a done deal! Let's fight!" they shouted, a newfound determination lighting up their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, they spotted two extra-bright white dots crossing paths on their badges. From the looks of it, one of them was definitely Agatha&mdash;the current points leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other was Benson, who was sitting pretty in fifth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agatha and Benson are going at it..." Clara said, her voice tinged with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cracked open his eyes but then shut them again right away, a faint smile on his face. "So what if they're fighting? It's none of our business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara arched an eyebrow, brimming with curiosity. "Osborne, aren't you even the slightest bit curious about who'll come out on top between Agatha and Benson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, wearing a laid-back grin. "Not in the least! I'm telling you, Agatha's gonna win, and it'll be a walk in the park for her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's eyes popped out in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How can he be so certain? Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson are all in the same league. It's not gonna be a total wipeout, is it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne really thinks Agatha can take Benson down that easily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of thought, Clara asked, "Osborne, what's your deal with Agatha?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes, a puzzled look crossing his face as he looked at Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by that? What kind of relationship could I possibly have with Agatha? I know her, but chances are she doesn't even remember me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara gasped, staring at him in utter disbelief, "Wait, seriously?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! Agatha definitely knows you! She even said you were her friend. When she bumped into us, she greeted us and asked about you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't believe me, just ask Leroy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara threw a look at Leroy, who nodded like crazy. "Clara's dead on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, dumbfounded, trying to wrap his head around what they'd just told him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're saying Agatha was asking about me? And she thinks of me as a friend? That just doesn't add up. We've never even had a proper conversation... I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice trailed off as he suddenly recalled the time he'd saved Agatha on the snowy summit of the seventh layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, his face clouded over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Hold on a second! Agatha was conscious the whole time? She knew I saved her? And she heard everything I said to Primordial? Even the part about me taking nine drops of her Phoenix Blood...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a shiver run down his spine, a wave of embarrassment hitting him like a ton of bricks, as if he'd been caught red-handed in the act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Thank God. From what Clara and Leroy said, Agatha doesn't seem bent on revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's a good sign!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">After all, I did save her life. Sure, taking her Phoenix Blood was a bit underhanded, but compared to the debt of saving her life, she shouldn't hold it against me, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Still, I've got to be on my guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If she has a volatile temper, I could end up with a powerful enemy. And let's not forget, she's from the Ember Phoenix Clan. According to Primordial, her Dark Phoenix bloodline has awakened, making her the one-of-a-kind in this cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Her status in the Ember Phoenix Clan is bound to be off the charts. If she decides to come after me I'm in deep trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave, a flash of regret crossing his face for not having taken care of Agatha when he had the opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Forget it! I'll wait for a chance to talk to Agatha and figure out what's really on her mind. If she resents me for taking her Phoenix Blood and overlooks the fact that I saved her life, then I'll find a way to get rid of her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Before she becomes a big shot in the Ember Phoenix Clan, I need to eliminate the threat before it grows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that decision made, Osborne put Agatha out of his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Clara let out another gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agatha really did it! Her score shot up by over 600 thousand points, while Benson's dropped by the same amount. That was so fast! She took Benson down in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara stared at Osborne in disbelief, amazed that he'd been right about Agatha easily defeating Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile and kept quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, since Agatha hadn't fully unleashed the Flames of the Dark Phoenix, Osborne still thought he could handle her. But he knew that as time went on, she'd become a real force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like Agatha's going after Broderick now!" Clara reported.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, she shrieked, "Oh my god! Agatha and Broderick barely fought for a minute, and it's already over! Agatha won again! Her score just jumped by over 700 thousand points. She's already passed the ten-million mark!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agatha is truly amazing!" Clara exclaimed in awe, her eyes glistening with a blend of shock and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Leroy could sense her formidable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the real jaw-dropping moment was for the spectators in Frost Peak City, who were witnessing Agatha effortlessly defeat both Benson and Broderick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some Empyrean Sacredness warriors couldn't help but let out gasps. A sense of intimidation washed over them as they watched Agatha win with such ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agatha is already the unrivaled champion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one in the entire Zephyr State duel can even come close to challenging her! There's no one who can withstand the attacks from her Phoenix Cry Bone Flute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her score has skyrocketed past ten million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's the first person in nearly a thousand years in Zephyr State to reach over ten million points, isn't she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With her current strength, even average Empyrean Sacredness warriors would probably hesitate before taking her on! Once the zone duel begins, Agatha stands a great chance of emerging victorious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sure she'll play a major part in the upcoming Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd in Frost Peak City was abuzz with excitement as they watched Agatha make her way towards Horace. The energy in the air was electric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, another intense battle was on the verge of erupting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A formidable group had finally approached Osborne, Clara, and Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Conrad and his teammates!</span></p></div>
