        <h1>Chapter 623 Unexpected Sparring</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Decisive enough. Then I'll personally test your strength!" Osborne thought, not explaining who he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the fastest person to act, an instructor from the training base and one of the three Class AA instructors. Without any probing, he directly transformed into a Vampire and punched Osborne with the proficiency level of Ninefold Tide Crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying force, like a tide, arrived in front of Osborne in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done!" Osborne murmured and punched out as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive collision of forces was like two high-speed large passenger planes colliding in the air, making a deafening sound. The airwaves blew the surrounding trees to tremble wildly, almost uprooting them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Osborne and the instructor were forced to take a few steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference was that Osborne only took three steps back, while the instructor took more than ten steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Osborne was amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His current strength was mighty and terrifying, and even Sam, known for his strength, was no match for him regarding it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Aresta, the 13th-ranked Godson of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>, who had defeated Sam with a single punch, only had a little more strength than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this instructor, after fighting him with a punch, only took a few steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Osborne's view, the instructor, who had fought with all his strength, was definitely not weaker than Sam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting!" Osborne murmured, very satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his opponent was extremely surprised, even shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His full-force punch was actually repelled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, he could feel Osborne's energy fluctuation. Osborne was just Class A+!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful! He is very strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted loudly and immediately threw another punch. This time, several other Class A+ instructors also joined in. Realizing Osborne's formidable strength, they no longer fought him head-on but began to surround and attack him with tacit cooperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tried to attack a few times, but each move was resolved by their joint efforts. He had great power but couldn't touch these instructors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even more interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was even happier. He had never encountered such a situation. He was confident that he could defeat each of the six instructors fighting with him at this time, and it would be very easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when the six of them joined hands, it was as if he had fallen into a quagmire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his attacks were powerful, they couldn't break through the combined defense of these six instructors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't employ more tricks, he would surely be worn down by these six instructors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there were only six instructors at the moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, fourteen more instructors were on high alert not far away and not yet joining the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems I must bring out my true skills! Otherwise, I'm afraid they will look down </span><span>on me even if I reveal my identity later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can transform into Vampires, and so can I! Moreover, my Vampire Transformation is more complete!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he activated the power of the Blood Cross within his body and began to transform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His short hair grew wildly, instantly turning into flowing long hair, each strand blood-red, like fresh blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two sharp fangs emerged in his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers grew long, sharp nails like daggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his face turned pale and more angular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the transformation, Osborne's speed, strength, defense, and recovery energy all became much stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the six instructors, a smirk on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six instructors in front of him, however, looked considerably changed. After Osborne's transformation into a Vampire, they clearly felt a kind of suppression and fear that came from their bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They suddenly stopped moving, their bodies shaking violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to them, the instructors and students in the distance who were not fighting also looked horrible, staring at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was puzzled, and the instructors and students were even more puzzled at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading instructor looked up at Osborne with difficulty and asked, "Who are you? Why do we feel a power in your body that makes us afraid and unable to resist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A power in my body that makes you afraid and unable to resist?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was even more surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because of my Vampire Transformation? I'm at a higher level than them after I transformed into a Vampire, so I can suppress them and make them afraid?" thinking of this, Osborne quickly retracted his Vampire Transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the instructors and students, in fear, returned to normal, but their eyes on Osborne were still heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the leading instructor suddenly shouted, "Everyone, attack together! His Vampire Transformation can suppress us. That's a huge threat to us! No more holding back. Kill him now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he rushed to Osborne. He launched an attack on Osborne madly, abandoning defense altogether, entangling him like a fierce beast, and not giving him a chance to transform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was a bit speechless. He was about to reveal himself but was interrupted by the dense attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other nineteen instructors also rushed over at this time, their eyes full of crazy killing intent, launching a dense attack on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was attempting to tear Osborne apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the students in the distance controlled countless combat drones and robots, instantly sealing the entire Training Base No. 6.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each combat drone and robot had now activated its weapon system, locking onto Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne was in a desperate situation.</span></p></div>
