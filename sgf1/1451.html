        <h1>Chapter 1450 Angry Calvin</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the simmering resentment in the Swift family towards Lachlan, there was little they could do to change the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, they found themselves hoping that Lachlan would successfully win over Hannah and secure a place in the Gellar family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their own fortunes depended on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia said, "Well, it's settled then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, I hope those words you just spoke weren't just a ploy to win over Ms. Hannah Gellar. If I find out you were being insincere, I won't let you off easy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, give me your contact number. Once Ms. Gellar is ready, she'll reach out to you. I expect you to show her your true self. If you manage to impress her, the Gellar family will certainly treat you well. We'll make you one of our own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished, the room was filled with mixed reactions from the Swift family&mdash;some were envious, others mocked Lachlan, but no one dared to speak up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but ultimately handed his contact number to Olivia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well then, I'll take my leave," she said, casting a lingering glance at Osborne before leading the Gellar family out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were gone, the Swift family erupted in a flurry of heated discussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, now that the Gellar family has left, you can drop the act! You'd better apologize for what you just said!" one of them shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, no kidding! Apologize right now!" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to pretend anymore. We all know those words were just for show! You're the last person who should be preaching about the Human Community. If you just say you're sorry, we might let it slide," a third voice added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Lachlan, just apologize!" they urged, their voices rising in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, a calm expression on his face. "You really think I said all that just to curry favor with the Gellar family? You want me to apologize? That's rich!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those were my honest feelings! What you've done to the Human Community is disgraceful&mdash;you're not even worthy to shine Hannah's shoes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize to you? Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to throw me in the dungeon, go ahead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His icy declaration left everyone momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Walter and Calvin's expressions darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough of this nonsense! Lachlan, do you really think we won't punish you? You're pushing your luck, and it looks like I'm going to have to teach you a lesson in honor of your deceased parents!" Calvin barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then advanced towards Osborne with a fierce glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile remained unfazed. "You want to teach me a lesson? Go for it! If I get hurt, I won't be able to meet Ms. Hannah Gellar. Honestly, I think she deserves better than a match with the Swift family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin froze at that, his face darkening further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "How dare he threaten me? The Swift family is counting on Lachlan to secure this alliance with Hannah. If Lachlan refuses to meet her, our plans will be in ruins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Calvin finally huffed, turning on his heel and storming off, clearly fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the room was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Walter felt that Lachlan was acting unusually bold, though he had no idea it was because someone had already assumed Lachlan's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter waved his hand dismissively. "Lachlan, you need to get ready. Remember what I said&mdash;you have to find a way to marry Hannah. If you fail&hellip; well, let's just say I won't be pleased. Those words you spoke today? You'll pay for them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a menacing glint flashed in Walter's eyes, and in an instant, he vanished, leaving Osborne momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne narrowed his eyes, contemplating the implications of what had just transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really the power of the Deity Overlord? Impressive! Yet, even with such strength, he still couldn't see through my disguise. Despite my actions and mannerisms being completely different from the real 'Lachlan,' he didn't suspect a thing. If possible, I should hold on to this identity of Lachlan a bit longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne strode purposefully out of the room, determined to continue his masquerade as Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Hannah, he figured he'd only have to keep her at arm's length for a few days, acting difficult enough to ensure she wouldn't want to marry him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had to be careful; if he truly failed to secure the engagement with her, he knew that both Walter and Calvin, who were already on edge, would surely make him pay for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I need to come up with a plan to elevate my standing within the Swift family. That way, even Calvin or Walter won't dare to punish me lightly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this resolve, Osborne returned to what used to be Lachlan's quarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place was a spacious little courtyard, a remnant of better times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the death of Lachlan's parents, he had been living here alone, along with a handful of human servants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the servants saw "Lachlan" return, fear flashed across their faces. They quickly prostrated themselves, their expressions dripping with humility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome back, Mr. Lachlan Swift," they muttered in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed at their submissive display. He waved his hand dismissively. "Get up! From now on, when you see me, you don't need to go through all that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the servants paled even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is an order! Anyone who dares to show me that level of respect again will face punishment!"</span></p></div>
