        <h1>Chapter 1795 Supreme Sovereign's Armor</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar looked down at his gleaming battle armor, his expression darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, well, well! I underestimated you! I can't believe you broke through my divine power defense, shattered my Supreme Malevolence Shield, and triggered my Supreme Sovereign's Armor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Supreme Sovereign's Armor?" Osborne raised an eyebrow, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! You've never heard of it, have you? The Supreme Sovereign's Armor is a cutting-edge defensive suit developed by the Artisan Institute! Its defensive capabilities are over ten times that of the Supreme Malevolence Shield! It's reached the pinnacle of Ultimate divine artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even a peak Deity King would take ages to breach its defenses! Among the younger generation of the Paramount Supreme Clan, only the Five Brilliant Scions are worthy of wearing it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With the Supreme Sovereign's Armor on, I'm practically invincible! What makes you think you can challenge me? No matter how strong you are, you'll never break through my defenses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are destined to lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Caesar stalked toward Osborne, his eyes glinting coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned. "Is that so? I find it hard to believe that this so-called Supreme Sovereign's Armor is that formidable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne threw a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A massive fist of dark energy hurtled toward Caesar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar smirked, making no attempt to dodge or defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next instant, the colossal fist collided with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The brilliance of the Supreme Sovereign's Armor flickered wildly, absorbing the impact without any sign of weakening. Protected by the armor, Caesar remained unscathed, still grinning as he advanced toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned; he sensed he was in for a tough fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He launched a flurry of attacks, each punch aimed squarely at Caesar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying blows landed on Caesar, but they were all absorbed by the Supreme Sovereign's Armor. Whether Osborne unleashed dark energy, spatial energy, or lightning energy, none could penetrate the armor's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Osborne's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar laughed triumphantly. "I told you, you can't break my defenses! With the Supreme Sovereign's Armor, I'm born to be invincible! No one from the younger generation can breach its protection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've lost! You pathetic human have no idea how deep the roots of the Paramount Supreme Clan run!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To think you could challenge us is sheer folly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar was now just a few feet away from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now it's my turn to strike back! Let's see how long you can hold out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he swung his Supreme Malevolence Sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A barrage of black sword lights rained down on Osborne. With the distraction of defense lifted, Caesar's attacks grew even more potent, and Osborne's divine power defenses were pierced. Fortunately, he quickly used his spatial power to evade the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! What good is your spatial power? This arena is only so big, and I wonder how long you can keep dodging! Plus, can your teammates escape my strikes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he said this, a cold smile crept across Caesar's face as he glanced toward another battlefield where Anastasia, Bryce, and the others were engaged in combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once I wipe them all out... you'll be in for a world of hurt, won't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Caesar abruptly ceased his assault on Osborne and shot toward Anastasia and her team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had realized that, as a member of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, Osborne was indeed a formidable opponent. With the Supreme Sovereign's Armor, he could hold his ground, but defeating Osborne would be nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Caesar decided to take out Osborne's allies first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face darkened, a storm brewing within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!" he scoffed, stepping in front of Caesar with an air of grim determination. "Caesar, you're courting death! Do you really think that with your Supreme Sovereign's Armor, you can't be defeated? You think I'm helpless against you? Fine, then let me show you what I'm really capable of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne raised his hand, and suddenly, eight identical figures sprang into existence around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These were his Spatial Clones!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Attack!" Osborne commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The eight clones lunged at Caesar, their powers of space swirling violently, causing the space around Caesar to shatter and collapse under pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, the Supreme Sovereign's Armor held firm, absorbing the hits without a scratch on Caesar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, he was now occupied, unable to pursue Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This realization fueled Caesar's anger and disbelief. "Spatial clones?! This is the signature move of the God of Space among the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings! How could you possibly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne cut him off with a smirk, saying, "Too many questions! You'd better focus on surviving first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a bond of mutual understanding, Osborne's clones attacked in a furious onslaught, following his every command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, to Caesar's credit, the Supreme Sovereign's Armor proved remarkably resilient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even against the relentless assault of eight clones, the armor did not yield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne muttered under his breath, "In the end, it's my cultivation level that's still lacking!"</span></p></div>
