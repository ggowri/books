        <h1>Chapter 643 The Terrifying Duke Medusa</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Osborne sensed a terrifying aura rapidly approaching from the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pair of emotionless eyes emerged before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant his gaze met them, layers of stone skin erupted on Osborne's body, accompanied by clicking sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression changed dramatically. This was the Petrification Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this was no ordinary power. Even a fully unleashed Class AA Marquis Medusa would struggle to threaten him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's martial art aura, fused with Level six Devil's Light, provided robust defense against petrification power, easily countering a Class AA Medusa's petrification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his martial art aura was at risk of being petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne unleashed the martial art aura, trying to counteract the petrification. Its effectiveness, however, was minimal, the spread of the petrification halted, but the already petrified areas remained unchanged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was extremely shocked, gazing at the approaching Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, a realization hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Duke Medusa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She must be a Class AAA Duke Medusa. I've wasted too much time here. Support from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> has finally arrived, and it's Duke Medusa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne was confident, he also sensed the danger of facing a Class AAA Duke Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength gap between AA and AAA was vast. While he could easily defeat an AA Marquis, the Duke posed a real threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Duke Medusa finally approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at the corpses around her and the nearly lifeless Medusa No. 63 at Osborne's feet, her eyes filled with rage and a murderous glint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack, crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Osborne's martial art aura began petrifying again, and the stone skin spread </span><span>rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Roll!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Refusing to succumb to full petrification, Osborne's martial art aura vibrated frantically to break the petrification, but its effect was weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Duke</span><span> was now just a hundred yards away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Escape! I can't fight her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Face grave, he stomped on Medusa No. 63's head and tore through space, stepping into the dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa's fury ignited upon seeing him escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you fleeing to? You must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She surged forward with terrifying speed, reaching Osborne in an instant and striking him on the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puff!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne coughed up blood but managed to slip into the dimensional rift just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Interdimensional travel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Activated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne vanished, leaving Duke Medusa fuming in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You damned little worm, you can't escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, her figure flashed and disappeared quickly, chasing in the direction Osborne fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Osborne emerged from the dimensional rift, now 30 miles away. He spat another mouthful of blood, his face pale and grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was too close!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Class AAA Duke Medusa is far too formidable. I can't contend with her yet. Luckily, I have spatial power and escaped fast enough. Otherwise, I'd be in dire danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, feeling a heat on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Duke's</span><span> last strike had been brutal. Had his body not been resilient, he would have been crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to address the petrification!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half of Osborne's body was petrified and felt stiff. Although the power of petrification was receding with the </span><span>Duke</span><span> distant, it was too slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He invoked the martial art aura, painstakingly shattering the stone skin layer by layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took more than ten minutes, but he finally restored his body to normal, though the burning sensation on his back lingered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It surprised Osborne extremely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His recovery was remarkably fast, even stronger than werewolf and Medusa after their transformation. Why was his back injury not healing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a little strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed a lingering power from the Class AAA Duke Medusa affecting his recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only way to heal completely is to eliminate this special energy," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his expression shifted again as Satan's Eye pulsed violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced back and realized Duke Medusa had caught up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was charging toward him with lethal speed, her face twisted in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her speed was terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still at a distance, bright light erupted from her eyes, and layers of stone skin once again enveloped Osborne, rendering his body stiff.</span></p></div>
