        <h1>Chapter 1991 The list of Hudson family-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, perfect timing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner and Julian both bowed toward God of Light, then pointed at Jethro. "We're not arguing, but there's something we can't make sense of! Why isn't there a single Hudson family member on the list for today's border competition?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jethro's been making excuses, claiming he submitted the list of Hudson family geniuses to you, and it's your fault for not choosing them! He even said he submitted a list of over 20,000 names. Ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are all these so-called geniuses from the Hudson family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, if Jethro really did submit the list, how come you didn't pick a single Hudson family member?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless... the Hudson family has already betrayed the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you're back, </span><span>God of Light</span><span>, please set the record straight and expose Jethro's lies. We need answers for the rest of us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're not scared to send our geniuses to the border competition, but we won't tolerate having traitors in our ranks! If the Hudson family has turned their back on the Human Community, we sure don't want them mixed in with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian finished with a cold smirk, his eyes locked on Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner's expression was no different, his smile sharp and mocking. While he didn't necessarily believe the Hudson family had betrayed the Human Community, it was hard to ignore that a family of their stature&mdash;Dukedom-level power&mdash;having no representatives in such an important competition was a slap in the face to everyone else. It just didn't sit right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at </span><span>God of Light</span><span>, waiting for her to tear Jethro's story to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others stood silent, expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Jethro, upon seeing </span><span>God of Light</span><span>, let out a sigh of relief. He also bowed respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, please, clear my Hudson family's name! We've sacrificed so much for the Human Community, and we always will. I won't let anyone slander us with accusations of betrayal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jethro shot Julian a venomous glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, </span><span>God of Light</span><span> finally spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see, so this is what it's about..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her gaze to Jethro. "Mr. Hudson did indeed submit a list of over 20,000 names to me&mdash;more than anyone else here," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in murmurs of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it true?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro really submitted a list of 20,000 names? He wasn't lying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Julian furrowed his brow and spoke up, "The number of names doesn't mean anything! Sure, Jethro might've submitted over 20,000 names, but they were probably all mediocre, right? Otherwise, how would </span><span>God of Light</span><span> have not chosen a single Hudson family member?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! The number doesn't matter! Only those with real talent&mdash;people who can challenge opponents above their level&mdash;are worthy of representing the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jethro's list must be full of ordinary Hudson family members who don't even qualify as geniuses. No wonder </span><span>God of Light</span><span> didn't pick any of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quiet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span> cut through the chatter with a sharp command. "You don't need to make assumptions, and you certainly don't need to blame Mr. Hudson! Among the 20,000 names he submitted, many were genuine geniuses of the Human Community. That includes all of Mr. Hudson's sons, daughters, and grandchildren. Based on their abilities, any one of them could've made the list."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, the room went silent. Eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it really true?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If so, why hadn't </span><span>God of Light</span><span> included any Hudson family members on the list?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at her, confusion etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're probably wondering why I didn't include any Hudson family members on today's list, right? Well... I was just as surprised by the list Mr. Hudson submitted to me! As for why I was surprised, I'm not ready to share that with you just yet."</span></p></div>
