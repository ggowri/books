        <h1>Chapter 1628 Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's Fear</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued his exploration, pushing further eastward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After traveling approximately 60 thousand miles, he came to an abrupt halt. In that instant, he felt an intense vibration emanating from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A wave of panic surged through his mind, clearly transmitted by the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression shifted to concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on? Why is the Lotus in distress? Could it be my imagination?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Furrowing his brow, Osborne attuned himself to the sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shock washed over him as he realized this wasn't a mere figment of his mind; the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was indeed pulsating with alarm, urging him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wondered, baffled, "What on earth is happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was a Cosmic Treasure, so how could it be so rattled?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What could be lurking ahead that would instill such fear in it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tension furrowed his brow as he hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment, Osborne decided to press forward cautiously. This time, he moved much more slowly, yet he could feel the Lotus' insistence growing stronger&mdash;pulling him back rather than pushing him forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just what is out there?" Osborne muttered under his breath, finally coming to a standstill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hesitating again, he connected with Riley through the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Riley, what lies beneath Divine Peak Nine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Deep within the 53rd mine, Riley was protecting Diana during her training when he heard Osborne's inquiry. He was momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Beneath Divine Peak Nine? My Lord, I'm not sure what you mean!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sighed at Riley's confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a moment to clarify, explaining, "I'm approaching the core area directly beneath Divine Peak Nine, but I'm sensing danger. Do you know what might be in that area?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley's demeanor shifted to one of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?! My Lord, you've actually entered the area beneath Divine Peak Nine? How did you get in? That place is an absolute no-go zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's an invisible force barrier preventing anyone from entering!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even Deity King warriors can't break through this barrier to access the lower region of Divine Peak Nine, let alone approach the core!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My Lord, the 53rd mine is the deepest we can safely reach&mdash;how could you possibly go any further?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was momentarily stunned by Riley's response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The area beneath Divine Peak Nine is a no-entry zone? There's a barrier that even Deity Kings can't breach?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then how am I already here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I haven't felt any barrier at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I've gone nearly 100 thousand miles in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sense of unease began to settle in Osborne's gut as he contemplated Riley's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be because of my spatial power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I navigate through parallel space; maybe that's why I couldn't feel any barrier holding me back. That's how I've managed to get this far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what exactly is there that even Riley doesn't know about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is a Cosmic Treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No Deity King warrior could instill fear in it! Whatever lies ahead must be incredibly dangerous&mdash;far beyond my current capacity to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the second time the Lotus has reacted with panic. The first was when I encountered that massive root creature in deep space...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So whatever is up ahead might be on the same level as that creature!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought, Osborne knew he couldn't go any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what lay ahead, it was not something he could handle right now. If he were to be discovered, even the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity might not save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Time to retreat!" he declared, quickly beginning to backtrack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, as he focused on the surrounding energy of the area, he felt a tug of indecision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The spiritual energy here was at least ten times denser than in the 53rd mine! Even at the fringes of Divine Peak Nine, the energy couldn't be more potent than this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Should I set up the Infinite Devouring Eyes here? If I can establish them in this location to absorb the energy freely, my cultivation speed would surpass anyone using Ultimate Essence Crystals&mdash;by at least a hundred times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even using Celestial Crystals wouldn't compare to that kind of speed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His thoughts raced, igniting a sense of temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne mused, "The Lotus warned me of danger, suggesting that I shouldn't proceed any further. So, perhaps this position isn't as perilous as I thought? And even if danger lurked here, the worst-case scenario would likely just be the destruction of the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I could always invest some resources to condense a second one! Do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't bring himself to surrender to the rich energy surrounding him. He focused on the Infinite Devouring Eyes, determining to transfer them to his new position.</span></p></div>
