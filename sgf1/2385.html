        <h1>Chapter 2304 Second Phase</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time crawled by. Up on the colossal, snow-capped mountain, Osborne was laser-focused on finding the Frost-kissed Heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd completely lost track of the state duel&mdash;honestly, he couldn't give a damn about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All that mattered was making every second count in his relentless search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What really bugged Osborne, though, was Agatha's continued absence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd obviously made it up the mountain, but their paths hadn't crossed once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could she have already bailed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe the mountain's freezing cold was too much for her, and she hightailed it back to the sixth layer from the seventh. Yeah, that's </span><span style="font-style: italic;">gotta</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> be it! I've got the Ascending Sacred Sanctum to keep me going on the seventh layer. But for Agatha to stick around like I have? That'd be a tough slog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne shrugged it off and pressed on with his search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As days blurred into nights, the first phase of the state duel wrapped up on the third day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From then on, it was a free-for-all. Everyone was fair game and could be targeted for their tokens or extra points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real carnage had begun, set to rage on for four long days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the final day, all participants had to haul their asses back to the first layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm for a final, brutal showdown to determine the duel's rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, back in Frost Peak City, Angela was a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips were clamped shut so tight, as if she was fighting back a tidal wave of emotions, and worry clouded her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne still hadn't shown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And on the scoreboard, his score was still stuck at 300 thousand points. He'd dropped out of the top ten and was now hanging around in twentieth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His score hadn't budged an inch in three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was convinced Osborne had bit the dust on the sixth layer&mdash;no question about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Angela just couldn't bring herself to believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she still clung to a glimmer of hope that Osborne would suddenly turn up, safe and sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the clock ticked, that hope dwindled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew in her heart that Osborne's chances of survival were slim to none.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a last-ditch effort, Angela pulled some strings through the Fairy Moon Sect and got in touch with Rupert, the head referee of the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed him for Osborne's whereabouts, and Rupert's answer was a real gut punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert had checked with all the referees inside the Arctic Maw Chasm, and none of them had seen hide nor hair of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Danilo chimed in, trying to offer some comfort, "Hey, Ms. Olsen, don't beat yourself up too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne was one of the best disciples our Mystic Sirius Sect has seen in a century. I'm bummed about his loss, too. But what's done is done. No use crying over spilt milk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"State duels are a rough game. Someone's </span><span>bound</span><span> to draw the short straw. Osborne just got unlucky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela bit her lip hard enough to draw blood without saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo wasn't about to drop it. "I know this is tough to swallow, Ms. Olsen. But Osborne's gone. Otherwise..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Angela interrupted him abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She drew in a deep breath, glanced up at the scoreboard, and all of a sudden, a sense of indifference washed over her. The state duel? It just didn't seem like a good use of her time anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But eventually, Angela gathered her resolve and decided to stay put.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It doesn't matter. I'll tough it out until the end. As long as the state duel isn't over, I can't lose hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, she locked her eyes on the scoreboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation had completely changed. Over the past three days, the rankings had been shifting like crazy, faster than the weather could change. The top-scoring contestants were neck and neck, constantly stepping up their game and piling on the points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was at the top of the leaderboard? It wasn't Agatha anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the scoreboard, Horace was in the first place with a score of 2.2 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right behind him, Broderick secured the second position with 1.8 million points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson took the third spot, having amassed 1.7 million points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucinda Turlington landed in the fourth place with a score of 1.3 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen Tatum occupied the fifth position, scoring 1.25 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skipping a few ranks, Conrad stood at the ninth place, his score reaching 1.08 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha was in the tenth position, having scored one million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moving further down, Jared held the twelfth place with 650 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave was in the fifteenth place, with a score of 450 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne was at the 20th place on the scoreboard, with a relatively lower score of 300 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the scoreboard, Angela couldn't help but heave a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne used to be on top! It's such a pity he decided to take on the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he'd just stuck to the fifth layer looking for tokens, he'd probably have a whole lot more points by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's teammate, that little girl Clara, is in a bind!" Danilo suddenly chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela quickly scanned the numerous projections, easily spotting Clara's. Clara was currently on the third layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm, running for her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bad news&mdash;she was being chased by a whole team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And a seriously tough one at that, led by none other than Conrad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, Conrad and his four teammates had Clara cornered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm chuckled, saying, "Hahaha!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep running! What'd you stop for, you little brat? Think you can outrun us?" Conrad sneered at Clara, his face dripping with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned </span><span>to </span><span>Conrad and continued, "Mr. Maurice, this chick's got a boatload of tokens on her! Mostly from layers four and three, worth close to a hundred thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She didn't even register these tokens under her name! Talk about hitting the jackpot. If she had, we'd only get a tenth of her points, even if we creamed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, these unregistered tokens are up for grabs! Once we take her down, they're all ours!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's almost a hundred thousand points' worth of tokens!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Maurice, with those extra points, your spot on the scoreboard will be even more secure. You might even climb up to eighth place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Malcolm finished, Conrad's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Clara and said, "Hand over all the tokens you're carrying! You're no match for me, so don't even bother putting up a fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's face was ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Convinced that Osborne wasn't easily killed, she scavenged tokens for three days, planning to give them to him upon his return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Clara stashed the unregistered tokens away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The initial three days of the state duel unfolded seamlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, when the fourth day marked the onset of the second phase, the situation took a turn for the worse. The badges acquired a new capability&mdash;detecting nearby individuals with a substantial number of tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her stealth efforts, she was discovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once word spread about her abundant tokens, the temptation proved irresistible, prompting others to covet and attempt to seize them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Clara had managed to elude her pursuers on several occasions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given her presence on the third layer, where the other contestants were relatively less formidable, escape was feasible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regrettably, this time fortune deserted her as Conrad's team targeted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this team of five, even Malcolm, the least powerful member, held the eightieth position on the strength leaderboard. It was an insurmountable challenge for Clara to fend them off.</span></p></div>
