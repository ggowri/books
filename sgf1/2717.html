        <h1>Chapter 2588 Fearless-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just smiled and ignored it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the second match began, featuring Rosalie, ranked fourth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, against Jasmine, ranked seventh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle between the two drew a lot of attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The final result was no surprise&mdash;Rosalie was stronger and steadily defeated Jasmine, becoming the second person to advance to the top five.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, it was Osborne's turn to take the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His opponent was Matthew, ranked third in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment the two stepped onto the stage, many in the audience lit up with excitement, fully focused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's starting, it's starting!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne versus Prince Matthew, ranked third on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. Will Osborne make it to the top five? We're about to find out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne making it to the top five? Impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although he defeated Prince Yunus, ranked fifth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, and did it with just one move, that was only because he happened to counter Prince Yunus!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And now the situation is reversed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prince Matthew excels at close combat. His speed and reflexes are incredibly fast. As for Osborne, he uses a bow! If Prince Matthew gets close to him, he's doomed. He'll be defeated instantly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly, how could the Royal Family let him make it to the top five?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's reached his limit!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just wait and see, this will definitely be a one-sided battle! The Royal Family is counting on this fight to restore their dignity and reputation!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd was talking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the stage, Matthew coldly stared at Osborne and directly pulled out a sharp dagger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dagger was entirely blood-red, emitting an eerie glow, giving off a chilling vibe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This dagger is a Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The top three in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, Seraphina, Emiliano, and Matthew, all possess the ability to simply wield a Supreme Sacred Artifact. Although it's just basic control, the power unleashed is still significantly stronger than a Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In previous battles, none of the three had used a Supreme Sacred Artifact because there was no need.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Matthew used his Supreme Sacred Artifact right from the start, clearly intending to go all out and leave Osborne no chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "Forcing me to use my Supreme Sacred Artifact&mdash;Crimson Dagger, you should feel proud of yourself! Being killed by my Crimson Dagger is also your honor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, take out your bow and arrows!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have one chance to shoot an arrow. After that, if you can't defeat me, I'll pierce your body with the Crimson Dagger!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Matthew finished speaking, his face was full of arrogance. The Crimson Dagger in his hand emitted a blood-red glow, enveloping him entirely, as if he were a terrifying blood shadow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Supreme Sacred Artifact? Your cultivation level hasn't even reached Empyrean Sacredness, yet you already possess a Supreme Sacred Artifact. Those strong ones at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection would be jealous if they saw this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew's face showed a proud expression upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am one of the most outstanding princes of the Royal Family. Isn't it normal for me to possess a Supreme Sacred Artifact? How could someone like you possibly understand? Those ordinary Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection guys aren't qualified to compare with me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "You have a point! Having this Supreme Sacred Artifact in your hands is simply a waste! In this world, it's not always about whose Sacred Artifact is of a higher grade that determines who's stronger!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's no need to use my Bloodwrought Bow to deal with you! Isn't close combat what you're best at? In that case, I'll defeat you in the field you're most skilled in!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want close combat? I'll go all the way with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, a massive scythe appeared in Osborne's hand, Warfare Scythe!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave up using the Bloodwrought Bow. Although he was confident he could defeat Prince Matthew with a single arrow from the Bloodwrought Bow, no matter how fast or reactive he was, it wouldn't matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even having a Supreme Sacred Artifact wouldn't help him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne still chose to engage in close combat with Matthew.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perfect, I can try out my Warfare Blade Technique!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with confidence.</span></p></div>
