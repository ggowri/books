        <h1>Chapter 2249 Four Arrows-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the high-rise platform, Angela's face was a thundercloud as she fixed a scathing glare on Lenny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Fixing the draw? That's just plain shady!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lenny let out an awkward chuckle. "Maybe it's just a fluke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela flashed him a frosty smile. "Mr. Wilkens, do you really think I'm that easy to fool? You think I'll swallow that story?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lenny clammed up, and the air crackled with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact was, there had been something fishy about the draw. His nephew Vadim had come to him, asking him to make sure Osborne was his first opponent. He wanted to teach Osborne a lesson, and Lenny had agreed without batting an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it had seemed like a small favor at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never saw Angela's reaction coming. Now, it felt like he was between a rock and a hard place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he waved it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the end of the day, it's all about what you can bring to the ring! If Osborne can't hold his own against Vadim, it doesn't really matter if they meet now or later. If he can't even take down Vadim, even if he somehow lucks out and makes it into the top ten, he won't cut it in the city duel in Tempest Fortress City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela went quiet at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes drifted over to Osborne, who stood there cool as a cucumber, completely unfazed by Vadim's bluster or the pressure of the moment. That really threw her for a loop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does this guy have some ace up his sleeve?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she quickly shook off the thought.</span><br><span>No way! Vadim is the star core disciple among all the Ascension Ten members in the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect! Except for Jamar and Bethan, everyone else is at least one level, maybe even two, below him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Vadim might not be all that on the Racial Convergence Planet, but Osborne is only at Ascension Eight. There's no way he can go toe-to-toe with Vadim! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I just hope he doesn't get pummeled too badly and can still compete in the later rounds. That way, there's still a slim chance he can make it into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Angela focused intently on the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne and Vadim stood at opposite corners of the arena. Vadim radiated excitement and aggression, eager for the battle to begin, while Osborne remained tranquil, quietly drawing his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim's eyes glinted with greed at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A quasi-Sacred Artifact? Ha! You might have used that to shine in the group matches and make it to the top twenty, but it won't be enough to take me on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think you're the only one with a quasi-Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Vadim slipped on a pair of gauntlets that shimmered with a faint light, an overwhelming aura bursting forth from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A quasi-Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lenny's nephew and one of the brawny core disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect, Vadim naturally boasted a quasi-Sacred Artifact. When it came to gear, he was head and shoulders above Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, he'd been sitting at the peak of Ascension Ten for ages, his cultivation level polished to perfection and on the cusp of breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead certain that taking on Osborne, who was just at Ascension Eight, would be a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this show on the road!" Vadim hollered, throwing a look at the referee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The referee gave a nod and declared, "First match of the top twenty&mdash;Vadim versus Osborne. Begin..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second the words left his lips, Vadim shot forward like a rocket, his fists balled up and the gauntlets on his hands blazing brightly.</span></p></div>
