        <h1>Chapter 2689 Predicament</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nearly fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors launched a frenzied attack. It was truly terrifying. Any one of them, unleashing their full power, could easily destroy a small planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, they are besieging Fairy Moon Sect!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Fairy Moon Sect's Protective Barrier was incredibly strong, with nearly a hundred thousand members exerting all their strength to maintain it, cracks like fine glass were still increasingly visible on the Protective Barrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this continues, the Protective Barrier will eventually shatter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, it will be over!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most members of Fairy Moon Sect are below Empyrean Sacredness, or just primary Empyrean Sacredness and mid Empyrean Sacredness. Only a small portion are advanced Empyrean Sacredness or above.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the Protective Barrier shatters, they will all be easily slaughtered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, we can't hold it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May gritted her teeth at this moment, her face slightly pale. She was fully maintaining the Protective Barrier, and the backlash from the attacks on the Protective Barrier made her feel quite uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her cultivation level was at Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others were even worse off. Almost everyone had pale faces at this moment, and many were already bleeding from the corners of their mouths, ears, and eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't hold on any longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was extremely anxious at this moment. She gritted her teeth and said, "All members with cultivation levels below Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, listen up! Leave immediately through the Cosmic Translocator! The coordinates for the Cosmic Translocator have been set and will take you to the secret base of the Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's expressions changed drastically upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, if we leave, what about you? With just you, it's even more impossible to maintain the Protective Barrier!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana shook her head. "Don't worry about us! Everyone with cultivation levels below Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, leave immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's faces showed struggle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What, you're not following my orders anymore?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana shouted, "Execute the order immediately! As long as you survive, the Fairy Moon Sect won't perish! One day, we will rise again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Alba!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears welled up in everyone's eyes, but they said nothing more. All those with cultivation levels below Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection quickly retreated, preparing to leave through the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick outside the Protective Barrier saw this and sneered coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Escape? Can you escape?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I said I would destroy your Fairy Moon Sect! Everyone must die! Even if you hide in a secret base, I can track your aura, find you, and kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's more, you can't escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This will be your burial ground!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick launched an even more terrifying attack, trying to break the Protective Barrier as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana bit her lip tightly at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew that even if she went to the secret base, Frederick would eventually find her. With Frederick's strength, he could easily remember the aura of everyone in the Fairy Moon Sect and track them down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unless they all possessed treasures like the Sublime Concealment Orb or fled far enough away, none of them could escape because Frederick had already decided to kill them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But there's no other way now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could only let those without enough strength leave first, while the rest tried to buy as much time as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the Fairy Moon Sect's secret base was set up inside Evernight Court!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was gambling at this moment, betting that Frederick wouldn't dare to lead people into Evernight Court's territory to hunt them down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up and go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana urged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, all Fairy Moon Sect members below Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection had entered the Cosmic Translocator. Without their help, the Protective Barrier's collapse sped up once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, the Cosmic Translocator was activated. It was a Level Two Cosmic Translocator, sufficient to transport them out of the Glorious Divine Kingdom and into a stronghold within Evernight Court territory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Cosmic Translocator was about to transport everyone away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, an unexpected event occurred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Cosmic Translocator had successfully activated. However, the people who should have been swiftly transported away were still standing on the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their teleportation failed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's faces showed confusion, followed by fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Cosmic Translocator malfunctioned!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Adriana's expression change. She angrily looked at Frederick outside the Protective Barrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick laughed loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since I decided to destroy your Fairy Moon Sect, how could I not be prepared? Even if you teleport away, I can still find you, but I don't want that hassle. It's better to kill you all right here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick took out a flag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The flag emitted a strong Sacred Artifact aura, being an extremely powerful Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Supreme Sacred Artifact can disrupt the Cosmic Translocator! Wherever it is, all Cosmic Translocators within tens of thousands of kilometers will fail!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can't escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's eyes were filled with anger. Staring at the flag in Frederick's hand, she wished she could rush out immediately and snatch it away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne held her back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shook his head at Adriana, then said to Frederick outside the Protective Barrier, "It's just a Supreme Sacred Artifact. And you dare to boast that all Cosmic Translocators within tens of thousands of kilometers will fail? Ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A Supreme Sacred Artifact can at most interfere with a Level Two Cosmic Translocator! If faced with a Level Three Cosmic Translocator, can your Supreme Sacred Artifact still interfere?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick squinted upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, I didn't expect you to still be alive? Strange, I clearly didn't see you come out of the Skyfall Casket. Could it be that you never went in at all?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Of course I went in! Not only did I go in, but I also saw some interesting things inside! If you knew, you'd definitely be shocked."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne's gaze swept over Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick still didn&rsquo;t know that all these people had already been parasitized by Soulbane Parasites!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the nearly fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors present, more than thirty had already been parasitized by Soulbane Parasites. The reason they still followed Frederick's orders was that their consciousness had not been completely destroyed yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once successful, they would immediately leave, or even turn against Frederick!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne sneered silently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick may seem impressive now, but he's actually in great danger. However, Osborne has no intention of warning him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You don't need to worry about why I'm still alive. Just answer me, can this Supreme Sacred Artifact interfere with a Level Three Cosmic Translocator?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick snorted coldly, "It indeed can't interfere with a Level Three Cosmic Translocator! However, a Level Three Cosmic Translocator can perform interstellar region teleportation. If I remember correctly, the Fairy Moon Sect doesn't have a Level Three Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick looked confident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom, only the Royal Family can build a Level Three Cosmic Translocator!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every Level Three Cosmic Translocator must involve a member of the Royal Family to help with its construction. The Fairy Moon Sect once applied to the Royal Family but was rejected.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Frederick concluded that the Fairy Moon Sect does not have a Level Three Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana's dim gaze also confirmed this point.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne smiled at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just because we didn't have it before doesn't mean we don't have it now!"</span></p></div>
