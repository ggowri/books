        <h1>Chapter 1582 A Better Plan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We got him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne Augustine's punch landed with brutal force. He used his dark power, and even if Murray had been ready, blocking it would've been tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, with no defense, Murray slammed into the divine barrier, blood spurting from his mouth as he crashed to the ground. The impact made the barrier shudder, almost cracking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Normally, the others in camp would've noticed the commotion and come to investigate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and Guy's actions might've been exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But, too bad for them, everyone in camp&mdash;all ten thousand of them&mdash;had already been turned into Vampires by Osborne. They just kept on with their business as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne strolled up to Murray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray struggled to lift his head, blood staining his lips, shock written all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who... who are you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've been hiding your strength?! What's your connection to Guy? This was all a setup, wasn't it? You planned to provoke us from the start and then take us down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you really after?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's lips twisted into a smirk, and he suddenly kicked Murray's wrist, which he'd been hiding behind his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A small communication device flew out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "Trying to pull a fast one? Thought you could call for help? Too bad, you're fresh out of luck. As for what we want? You'll know soon enough, and you'll be joining us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to Guy and said, "Guy, shatter his divine essence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy smiled easily. "Of course, my lord."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Guy swung a powerful punch into Murray's chest, channeling his strength to break Murray's divine essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Augh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray let out a bone-chilling scream. Feeling his divine power destroyed, despair settled in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes turned bloodshot. "Guy! You've lost it! You shattered my divine power? And you're taking orders from him? You're out of your mind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"General Saxton will avenge me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter what you're planning, you won't succeed. You're finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stayed calm. "Enough with the yelling. Just accept becoming one of my Vampire followers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, a drop of blood merged into Murray's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his divine essence shattered, even as a Deity Overlord, Murray had no way to resist Osborne's transformation. He screamed in agony, just like Donald had before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two men's screams echoed for ten minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, under the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, both of their bodies recovered. Murray's divine essence was fully restored, and Donald's broken teeth grew back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both of them looked at Osborne with admiration, kneeling on one knee. "Greetings, my lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The transformation was a success. They retained their memories, but their loyalty had shifted completely. From now on, Osborne was the only person they were devoted to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need the Borden and Saxton families to clash. Any ideas on how we could make that happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked, his tone calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald spoke up first. "My lord, that should be easy. My father, Herman Saxton, spoils me more than anything. If I go back and tell him that Guy bullied me, he'll definitely come after Guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guy is one of us. I don't want him to get hurt. Your father is much stronger than Guy. I want a conflict between the Borden and Saxton families, but not at the cost of Guy's life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's eyes filled with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spoke up, "If it's for your plan, I don't mind dying, my lord. I'm ready to lay down my life for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waved his hand dismissively. "That plan won't work. Come up with another."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy spoke again. "My lord, I could pretend to be my brother, Laird! My brother is also a peak Deity Overlord. His power and status are equal to Herman Saxton's. Plus, he's the general of the City Guard. If Herman and my brother clash, it could not only spark conflict between the Borden and Saxton families but also drag both the Wild Flame Army and the City Guard into it, escalating into full-blown conflict!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Guy finished, Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A conflict between the Borden and Saxton families would be enough to satisfy him. But if the Wild Flame Army and the City Guard got involved, that would be an unexpected bonus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Wild Flame Army and the City Guard were the two most powerful military forces in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they clashed, the entire city would be thrown into chaos. None of the factions in Wild Flame City would be able to stay out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Out of chaos, heroes rise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the turmoil, Osborne could exploit the situation and reap the rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the more turmoil, the less attention on the Human Community, giving the Spark of Blaze a chance to gather more human warriors and grow quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne put a smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell me more..."</span></p></div>
