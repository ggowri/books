        <h1>Chapter 1689 Urgency</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tobey mentioned that many within Paramount Supreme Clan are plotting to completely wipe out the Human Community. This decision has already been tacitly approved by the esteemed Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, in the very near future, Paramount Supreme Clan will lead a massive force of Dark Deity Legion troops to launch a large-scale extermination campaign against the various resistance groups in the West Zone of Celestara, who are currently holding out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once the resistance in West Zone is eliminated, the entire Human Community in Celestara will be powerless to resist and will be eradicated one by one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's words made Osborne's face turn grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paramount Supreme Clan! Are they actually planning to wipe out all of the Human Community in Celestara? And will a massive force of Dark Deity Legion troops attack West Zone soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>West Zone was the last hope for Human Community. Various resistance groups had united there to hold back Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was only because Lord Malevolence's main focus wasn't on exterminating Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His primary goal was to explore the divine peak, and the Deathborn scattered throughout Celestara also kept many of the Dark Deity Legion troops occupied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Dark Deity Legion were to concentrate their efforts on West Zone, could the resistance groups really stand a chance? It seemed impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, and his mind filled with concern for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, a disciple of the God of Night, was one of the leaders of Human Community resistance. She was definitely in West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Dark Deity Legion attacked, Isa would be in grave danger, not to mention Clarissa, Emma, and Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all been taken by Isa and were likely in West Zone, part of one of the Human Community resistance groups. If West Zone fell, their fates would be dire&mdash;likely death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I can't let this happen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened, and a sense of urgency settled in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like I need to accelerate my plans. I have to take control of Wild Flame Army in secret. Not just Wild Flame Army but also Inferno Army, Thunderwind Army, and Firestorm Army. I need to control Ninth Dark Deity Legion in East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even that might not be enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>East Zone has ten Dark Deity Legions, while South Zone, North Zone, and Central Zone have even stronger forces."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know when Paramount Supreme Clan plans to move against Human Community resistance in West Zone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aldrich didn't say. The specific timing might only be known by the higher-ups in the Paramount Supreme Clan. My Lord, if you want to know, you could capture Aldrich and interrogate him. But Aldrich is very powerful. He's been a Deity King warrior for a long time. Even if we work together, we might not be a match for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned as well. "Aldrich, huh? If I get the chance, I'll take him on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne forced himself to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Paramount Supreme Clan were to attack West Zone tomorrow, he would have no way to stop it. He was now powerful enough to rival a Deity King, but in a war of this scale, his influence was minimal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he needed to do was enhance his strength and gain control over more forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne had the opportunity, he could create some trouble for Paramount Supreme Clan, making it impossible for them to focus entirely on Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a plan in mind, Osborne felt a bit of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to head to Celestial Crystal Mine! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can get my hands on enough Celestial Crystals, my strength will skyrocket! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, Anastasia, Grand</span><span>pa</span><span>, and the others have all reached the peak of the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with their impressive talents, breaking through to become a Deity King is no easy feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with enough Celestial Crystals, it'll be a different story. They'll be able to swiftly ascend to Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And every additional Deity King in Human Community gives us a better chance against Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, Osborne waved his hand, instantly dismissing all the clones and Dark Undead. He gathered Angelo, Edison, and the rest, then sought out Diana, who had been waiting nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All se</span><span>t</span><span>! They're </span><span>my guys</span><span> now," Osborne </span><span>told</span><span> Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in surprise. Osborne had not only dealt with Deathborn King and his army but had also </span><span>transformed</span><span> Angelo to be one of his underling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gasped but refrained from asking too many questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are we heading to the Celestial Crystal mine now?" she inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a thought, he smiled and said, "Hold on, let me introduce you to a few people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he reached out to Sebastian, Anastasia, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a black dimensional portal appeared beside him, and through it emerged Sebastian, Anastasia and Zoe, along with Bryce and his sister and Divine Shadow.</span></p></div>
