        <h1>Chapter 2277 Why Did You Mislead Osborne-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching Osborne leave, Angela stared at Adriana, her face a picture of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed to have something on the tip of her tongue, but every time she was about to speak, she held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana gave her a smile. "Come on, what's bothering you? Just say it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela finally found her voice. "Ms. Alba, why did you mislead Osborne? Merging four powers at the Supernal Deity King Level? That's almost unheard of. Merging three powers is already a once-in-a-blue-moon feat, the mark of a real prodigy. Even you only managed to merge three powers ahead of time back then, right? You tried for a fourth but didn't succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the whole Glorious Divine Kingdom, even across the entire Racial Convergence Planet, no one has ever pulled off merging four powers ahead of schedule. And even among the Empyrean Sacredness warriors, only a handful can do it. Aren't you just piling on the pressure by telling him that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was left scratching her head in bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana let out a soft laugh. "Is a little pressure such a bad thing? And who said no one can merge four powers ahead of time? Out there in the vast expanse of the universe, there are plenty of folks who can!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For Isa this time, my expectation is that she should forcibly merge at least three powers, and it'd be even better if she can manage four. Only by achieving this can she stand a chance against the geniuses from those genuine Apex Clans when she ventures into the core regions of the universe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was so stunned that her jaw nearly dropped to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that really doable? Even though Isa is a Celestial Progeny, attempting to merge four powers ahead of schedule is an incredibly tall order, isn't it? I still firmly believe it's just out of the question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana replied calmly, "Is it impossible? That's exactly what sets a Celestial Progeny apart&mdash;transforming the seemingly impossible into reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As her teacher, I have to set the bar as high as possible. Otherwise, it would be a huge waste of her exceptional talent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela let out a long sigh. "Fine! You're always right. Isa, being a Celestial Progeny, might actually pull it off. But Osborne isn't. Telling him that might just demoralize him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana flashed a smile. "Get discouraged? Not him! A real powerhouse doesn't get disheartened just because others are more powerful. Instead, they'll roll up their sleeves and work even harder to catch up. I have full confidence in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I invited him back to the Fairy Moon Sect just because of your recommendation? If I hadn't seen the spark of true greatness in him, I wouldn't have even shown my face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she gazed off into the distance. "It's a shame he's not destined to be part of the Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's carrying so many burdens on his shoulders that there's not much I can do to help him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana gave a little shake of her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, anyway, since I've given him some guidance this time, he should at least remember my kindness. If the Fairy Moon Sect ever runs into trouble in the future, I hope he won't just stand by and watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's eyes nearly popped out of her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is Ms. Alba suggesting that the Fairy Moon Sect might need Osborne's help someday? That was unthinkable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Fairy Moon Sect? In trouble? It is the mightiest First-rate Power in the Glorious Divine Kingdom. Who on earth could pose a threat to it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And even if it does face a problem it can't handle, what can Osborne possibly do about it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shook her head but kept her lips sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply fixed her eyes on Adriana and asked, "Ms. Alba, will you take part in the upcoming Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana paused for a moment, then shook her head.</span></p></div>
