        <h1>Chapter 1945 Peak Deity King Level</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time experimenting with the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He channeled dark energy, lightning energy, and even pure divine power, each time producing results that left him thoroughly impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Compared to the Bloodwrought Bow, other divine artifacts are nothing but scraps! The only thing that might come close is Anastasia's Hammer of Thor..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne carefully stored the Bloodwrought Bow away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Over the next few days, get used to the Bloodwrought Armor and the Bloodwrought Bow. We'll set off for that tree's lair in three days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in surprise. "You're coming with me? Didn't you say that only those below the Supernal Deity King rank can enter that place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald replied coolly, "True, I can't enter that realm myself. But I can escort you to the vicinity... Otherwise, you might not make it there safely on your own!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my one shot, and I can't afford any slip-ups! I'll be waiting for you outside the tree's lair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smirk crept across Osborne's face at the Creation Herald's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Escort me? I bet you're just reluctant to part with the Bloodwrought Armor and Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You want to wait until I've done my work before turning on me and taking everything back, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw through the Creation Herald's intentions but chose to keep his thoughts to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Osborne smiled and said, "Having your protection puts my mind at ease! Don't worry, I promise I'll complete the task you set for me. That tree thinks it can devour you? It's practically asking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take a breather now, and we'll get ready to leave in three days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald nodded approvingly. "Good! Just remember, interdimensional travel is off the table here, so don't even think about running!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that warning, the Creation Herald vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no intention of fleeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Primordial wanted to consume that other World Tree offshoot, he was more than willing to help. After all, their fates were intertwined, and Primordial's power boost would benefit him immensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to use these three days to organize the memories he had acquired from over twenty Paramount Supreme Clan warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of these warriors wielded different powers&mdash;dark, fire, life, water, lightning, and even light elemental powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could compile all the training insights from these memories, he could pass them on to members of Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they absorbed and understood this knowledge, it would help them fill in their gaps, making it easier for them to grasp the Divine Ascendance Technique and break through to the Supernal Deity King rank in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with so many memories to sort through, three days just wouldn't cut it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some contemplation, Osborne decided to enter Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside Hope Haven, time was accelerated by a factor of two hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Osborne could also apply that time acceleration to himself outside of Hope Haven, but he didn't want the Creation Herald to discover that he possessed time power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he stepped into Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days there would translate to an astounding three hundred days in real-time&mdash;almost ten months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was more than enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly briefed Anastasia and the others about the situation, distributing a Rainbow Armor or Dominion Battle Suit to each of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reassured them, "Don't worry about a thing. Focus on boosting your strength. Now, let's get to work!" With that, he settled into a focused training regimen, ready to make the most of his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight months had passed, and Osborne finally organized the memories of over twenty Paramount Supreme Clan warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout this process, he absorbed the training insights contained within those memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne remained at the late Deity King level, his mastery over various energies had improved significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was diligently addressing his shortcomings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he sealed the memories related to Thunder Power within Anastasia's mind, while the memories of light elemental power found a home in Mila's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra received the fire elemental training insights, Bryce got the water elemental, and Hannah was entrusted with both dark and life elemental powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once this was done, each of them immediately entered a state of seclusion to focus on their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "Eight months have flown by!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just two more months to go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hope to reach the peak of Deity King level during this time. Plus, I need to keep enhancing my elemental essences. After all, I'm gearing up to face a powerful World Tree offshoot, and I have to be wary of the Creation Herald's schemes. The stronger I am, the better my chances!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began to consume blue Miracle Elixirs in large quantities to boost his elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for leveling up, he decided to rely on his Infinite Devouring Eyes to naturally enhance his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two months sped by in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne emerged from Hope Haven, returning to Epochal Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back already?" The Creation Herald had been waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Osborne, astonished. "In just three days, you've gone from late-stage Deity King to the peak? Impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled casually, "I was just a hair's breadth away from breaking through before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald didn't press further. "In that case, we have even more assurance! Let's set out now! My main body has been battling that tree for over a hundred years, and only recently have I finally sensed the location of its main body and lair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We only have this one chance! If we fail, it might seal off its lair for good or even relocate entirely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Don't worry. As long as your plan is solid, I'll make sure it goes off without a hitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne's confidence, the Creation Herald gave a satisfied nod. "Alright, let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, curiosity piqued, "Where exactly are we headed? At this point, you should tell me where that tree's lair is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald replied calmly, "It's located in deep space."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deep space?" Osborne's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "No wonder only those with spatial power can reach it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this World Tree offshoot be the same one that attacked me in deep space before? Am I really going back for revenge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, a fierce determination ignited within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Alright! I'll harness my spatial power. Just guide me along!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald led Osborne swiftly away from the core of Epochal Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll enter deep space from here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p></div>
