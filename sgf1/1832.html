        <h1>Chapter 1831 Dukedom Level Powers' Strength</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren continued, "As for Sanctum Level Powers, I'm not entirely sure what the criteria are. It's possible that the term 'Sanctum Level Power' is more of a concept than an official classification. The remaining two sanctums of the Human Community&mdash;Sanctum of Night and Sanctum of Light&mdash;are simply so far beyond ordinary Dukedom Level Powers in strength that they stand apart and are given this special designation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their power doesn't stem from how many peak Deity Kings or Supernal Deity Kings they have; it's mainly because both the God of Night and the God of Light are unbelievably powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All in all, Dukedom Level Powers are immensely strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Falcon Alliance ranks as a First-rate Power, boasting at least a hundred peak Deity Kings. If the Baxter family decides to send a Supernal Deity King to aid them, we're going to be in serious trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Darren finished speaking, Osborne couldn't help but furrow his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized he had previously underestimated the strength of the Human Community factions in the West Zone, misled by his experiences with the former Pioneers of Starlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, the only Deity King warrior they had was the group leader, who was just at the early stages of Deity King. But it was still classified as a Second-rate Power. This gave Osborne the impression that the First-rate Powers in Apocalypse City couldn't be much stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was that the former Pioneers of Starlight was merely the weakest kind of Second-rate Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having just one Deity King warrior automatically qualified a force as Second-rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, possessing 10 thousand or 100 thousand Deity Kings might still result in only a Second-rate classification. To even be considered a First-rate Power, an organization needed a minimum of a hundred peak Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was an impressive feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recalled his encounter with Hubery, a peak Deity King. During their duel in the arena, he fought Hubery without using his Spatial Clone, summoning Dark Undead, or relying on any borrowed strength, and he found himself hopelessly outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had broken through to the mid-Deity King realm now, he still felt uncertain about taking down a peak Deity King without a full assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, a hundred peak Deity Kings represent an unimaginable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was just the base requirement for being recognized as a First-rate Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could say for sure how many peak Deity King warriors the Falcon Alliance had; Darren certainly didn't know, as his previous rank had never allowed him to find out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In any case, the Falcon Alliance was undeniably powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne knew that if he unleashed all his trump cards and went all out, he wouldn't have to fear the Falcon Alliance. After all, he commanded a legion of 10 thousand Blood Demon members, capable of creating sixty-four Spatial Clones, summoning a million Dark Undeads, and using borrowed strength to boost his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was quite aware that he, alone, could be considered a superpower. No matter how many peak Deity Kings the Falcon Alliance deployed against him, he wouldn't blink an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Supernal Deity Kings were a different story entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How powerful are Supernal Deity Kings?" Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never seen a Supernal Deity King in action, let alone faced one, so he had no idea what their strength really entailed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just having one Supernal Deity King is enough to elevate a force to Dukedom Level Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That alone suggested that Supernal Deity Kings must be significantly stronger than peak Deity Kings, and Osborne didn't feel confident about going up against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Supernal Deity King... So, Apocalypse City has two Dukedom Level Powers, the Baxter family and the Hudson family. That's two potential Supernal Deity Kings in the city?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are the Baxter and Hudson families located?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to check them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of intrigue towards the Supernal Deity Kings, eager to learn more about the ranks beyond peak Deity King and discover just how powerful they truly were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye in his possession, he thought that perhaps just a glance would reveal deeper insights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren explained, "The Baxter family resides on Apocalypse Island, right in the heart of Apocalypse City! Apocalypse Island is the core of the city, heavily fortified and incredibly difficult to approach. In fact, the Hudson family used to live there as well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But over the years, they've fallen on hard times. Once, they were among the top three families in the Human Community, but the losses they suffered on the battlefield have really taken a toll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They can no longer compete with the Baxter family. There were frequent clashes when both families shared the island, and eventually, the head of the Hudson family decided it was best to withdraw from Apocalypse Island to avoid further conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, they've set up camp to the east of Apocalypse City, in a place known as Hudson Valley. It's not too far from here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded thoughtfully, absorbing the information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, it sounds like the Baxter family is the strongest force in Apocalypse City right now. But that won't last for long!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all go about your business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm heading to Hudson Valley to get a better grasp on the capabilities of a Supernal Deity King before I make my next move..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne melded into the fabric of space, vanishing from sight before anyone could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hudson Valley lay to the east of Apocalypse City, surrounded by towering peaks and lush, verdant forests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for Osborne to locate the valley, where he found a massive divine power barrier enveloping the area completely.</span></p></div>
