        <h1>Chapter 963 Shocked Sebastian</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt a tremor run through his body as he sensed the depth of Sebastian's despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, his grandfather seemed to age before his eyes, the weight of his injuries and the looming threat of Gerardo pressing heavily on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne urged, his voice filled with determination, "Grandpa, don't lose hope! Your injuries will heal! I might not be able to fix you up right now, but once I break through to Class S, my Light of Redemption will have the power to truly heal you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In time, no matter how grave your injuries, you will heal completely! Please, don't lose hope. Both the Augustine family and the Draco Group still need you&mdash;just as I do. Your support means everything to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian looked at him, momentarily taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Deep down, he knew the severity of his condition. He couldn't fully believe that Osborne's ability could mend what had been broken by divine power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, wanting to ease his grandson's worries, he nodded slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian said, his tone serious, "Alright, I'll wait for you to reach Class S. But even if my injuries do heal, I'm still getting old. I'll step down and let you take my place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After what we've faced, you've felt Gerardo's strength firsthand. He'll be back in Rosmandi soon, and if we can't stop him, both the Augustine family and the Draco Group are doomed. I'm too old to keep up, and as much as it pains me to admit it, I can't hold back Gerardo anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I believe in your talent, Osborne. Right now, you're the only one who can stand against him and lead the Augustine family and Draco Group into the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You have to become the new Godfather!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne clenched his jaw, determination flooding through him. "I promise I will!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A smile broke through Sebastian's pain as he looked at his grandson's resolute face, pride swelling in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's get moving then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll have the Draco Armed Services Branch pull everyone back to Newport City. The Aberrants is going to hit us hard, and leaving our forces here to defend will just be a waste. We can always reclaim lost territory, but lost lives can't be brought back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We just need to hold the line in Newport City!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded in agreement, fully on board with his grandfather's plan. He'd also call back the members of Blood Demon to reinforce the Augustine Estate's defenses and prepare for Gerardo's impending arrival.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for the rest of the territories, they could be sacrificed if necessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as Osborne reached out to contact the Blood Demon members, a sinking realization hit him. After Gerardo had abducted him, the Blood Demon team had mobilized completely, launching a counteroffensive against the Aberrants to rescue him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the Aberrants weren't going to let the Blood Demon waltz into their stronghold without a fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clones were swarming everywhere, blocking the Blood Demon members at every turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Osborne's heart sank as he learned that over five thousand Blood Demon members were now surrounded by even more clones in a fierce battle at the border.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, what's wrong?" Sebastian asked, noticing the sudden shift in his grandson's demeanor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't hold back, quickly filling him in on the dire situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have to go save them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's expression turned blank, shock washing over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't realized that the ten training base members he had entrusted to Osborne had evolved into the Blood Demon organization, gaining strength beyond what he had ever imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian thought, "Over five thousand Blood Demon members, all Class AA or higher?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And more than five hundred at Class AAA?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian replied, his face lighting up with fierce determination, "Osborne, you truly are more suited to be the Godfather than I ever was. I've spent decades building up the Draco Armed Services Branch, and now it's been surpassed by Blood Demon. Maybe I really am getting old!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go save them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll rally the Draco Armed Services Branch too! Before we hunker down in Newport City, we'll strike hard and make Gerardo feel the pain!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne cast a worried glance at his grandfather. "Grandpa, you're seriously injured. Are you sure you can still fight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian let out a hearty laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't sweat it! While I might not be back to my best, throwing myself into the fray is still on the table. As long as Gerardo isn't around, I'll be fine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Osborne nodded with resolve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright then! Let's cause a ruckus and make Gerardo regret crossing us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne activated his interdimensional travel and quickly arrived at the front lines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They landed in a vast canyon where chaos reigned, the air thick with tension. On one side stood the Blood Demon members, over five thousand strong, fierce, and disciplined. Opposing them were the Aberrants, a relentless horde of clones that outnumbered them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two forces combined made for a staggering 12 thousand combatants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first glance, it was clear&mdash;the Aberrants had the upper hand. Their numbers were greater, and they boasted nearly a thousand Class AAA clones, along with more than a dozen Class S warriors ready to tear through any resistance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If not for the Blood Demon's unmatched teamwork and their arsenal of advanced energy weapons and armor, they would have been overwhelmed long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the Blood Demon members were in a precarious position despite their skill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Aberrants was hell-bent on eradicating them.</p></div>
