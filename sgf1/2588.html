        <h1>Chapter 2480 Ambush-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since it was confirmed that Osborne's Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were with Lionel, Osborne had become worthless in their eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't even be bothered to make a move against Osborne anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, when Osborne quietly left, no one cared, and everyone frantically chased after Lionel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Lionel thought Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge had safely fallen into his Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, all he wanted was to escape from here as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he had no idea that Osborne had already found a hidden safe spot and couldn't help but cast a mocking glance at Lionel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "When Lionel discovers the truth, he might be so angry that he'll cough up blood, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not only did he fail to take my Kingdom Duel Badge, but he also lost the Void Sword, was relentlessly hunted by a group of Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection and Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors, and even got seriously injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I almost feel sorry for him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne spoke, he raised his palm, and a Kingdom Duel Badge appeared in his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number on this Badge clearly displayed over 46 billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's right, this is Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the one Lionel put into the Dimensional Bag wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t real at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was already on guard; he knew Lionel had a scheme and naturally wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t sincerely make a deal with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Kingdom Duel Badge he threw out was real. After all, with his abilities, he couldn't forge one yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Lionel was about to grab Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge, Osborne's Satan's Eye unleashed a powerful ocular energy, instantly enveloping the Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He cleverly swapped his own Badge with another Kingdom Duel Badge he had obtained from someone else. The Kingdom Duel Badge that truly belonged to Osborne had already been quietly retrieved into the Satan Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Kingdom Duel Badge Lionel collected had no Kingdom Duel Scorepoints on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lionel, you want to deceive me? Then I'll pretend to go along with your deal and make you pay a heavy price!" Osborne said with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could imagine, when Lionel barely escaped and eagerly took out the Kingdom Duel Badge from the Dimensional Bag, expecting to see over 46 billion Scorepoints, but found nothing. At that moment, Lionel's expression would surely be priceless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Lionel told others the truth, no one would believe him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone would only think that Lionel kept Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge for himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, everyone's hostility would be directed at Lionel, and they would no longer trouble Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perfect!" Osborne was extremely satisfied with his plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did he successfully toy with Lionel and seize Lionel's Supreme Sacred Artifact, the Void Sword, but he also shifted the trouble onto Lionel, allowing himself to escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, it's time to focus on my own matters! There's still half a year until the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. But within this half year, it's unlikely for my strength to make any significant breakthroughs. At most, after absorbing the Magma Devourer's Marrow Crystal, my body can advance to the advanced Sacredness Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for other aspects, there's basically no room for improvement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just in time to use this period to search for my parents. They were sold as slaves to the Stellar Exploration Organization, Frenetic Storm Warband. Within this half year, I must find the Frenetic Storm Warband and rescue my parents!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne began to move away from the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This path leading to the depths of the universe is still full of dangers for Osborne at this moment. Since no one is chasing him now, it's best for him to stay away from them.</span></p></div>
