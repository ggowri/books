        <h1>Chapter 2590 He’s Useful to Me</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne's Warfare Scythe seemed to turn into a phantom, swiftly slicing across Matthew. With each cut, blood splattered, creating a scene both gruesome and shocking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew's once-proud speed and reflexes seemed sluggish in front of Osborne at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't dodge Osborne's attacks at all!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne sheathed his blade and stood at a distance, Matthew let out a piercing scream, so shrill it sent chills down one's spine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood gushed from many parts of his body, instantly staining his luxurious battle attire red. With a thud, he dropped to his knees on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Crimson Dagger in his hand slipped to the ground as he could no longer hold it, blood dripping from his trembling fingers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tendons in his wrist were severed by Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lost!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t look back at Matthew&rsquo;s condition but turned his gaze to Zorro.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can you declare my victory now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, gasps erupted. The spectators were stunned. Matthew was still holding his ground against Osborne; though he seemed at a disadvantage, at least he wasn&rsquo;t injured. But in the next second, everything took a drastic turn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most people only saw a blur before Osborne was standing in the distance, while Matthew was already covered in wounds, bleeding profusely, and collapsed with a scream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's attack was just too fast!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, many on-site with cultivation levels at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection or Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection couldn't help but show shocked expressions. They felt that if they faced such terrifying and swift attacks, they might not be able to dodge them either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was shocked, and discussions erupted among the crowd. However, the Royal Family's area was unusually silent. The princes, princesses, and even Callista were all silent, their expressions extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew actually lost!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Yvonne and Yunus were defeated, Matthew also lost. Among the nine princes and princesses competing, Matthew's strength ranked in the top three. He could even easily wield the Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, he still lost.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had thought his close combat skills could counter Osborne, but Osborne didn&rsquo;t use the Bloodwrought Bow. Instead, he defeated Matthew using the close combat techniques Matthew excelled at.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was undoubtedly Matthew's most humiliating moment!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is not just Matthew's humiliation but a disgrace to the entire Royal Family!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne has advanced to the top five!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family's plan to stop Osborne, Clara, and Leroy from entering the top five completely failed in the first match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista was furious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She deeply regrets it now. If she had known this would happen, she wouldn't have sent Matthew to deal with Osborne but should have sent the strongest, Seraphina, directly!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Osborne has defeated Matthew and entered the top five, leaving the Royal Family utterly humiliated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, it&rsquo;s just a matter of seeing how much more embarrassing it will get!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista couldn't help but let out a cold snort, staring in Osborne's direction, her eyes filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone named Osborne is despicable, disgusting trash! How dare you humiliate our Royal Family like this? I can't do anything to you during the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, but once it ends, I will make you regret it!" Callista thought coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Frederick's voice echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Callista, don't go after this Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista was startled upon hearing this and looked at Frederick in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's lips curled into a smile at this moment, also looking in Osborne's direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, his voice continued to echo in Callista's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Osborne is quite interesting!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although he embarrassed the Royal Family of our Glorious Divine Kingdom, don't go after him! At least, not until we leave Necropolis City! The stronger he is, the more useful he will be to me. Perhaps, whether we can ultimately gain power in Necropolis City might depend on him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista was shocked upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Depend on him? Impossible! The only one we can count on is Seraphina!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not necessarily!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick said calmly, "In any case, before we leave Necropolis City, I forbid anyone from going after him! He must enter that place, maybe he can get the key..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista didn't argue further and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I understand! However, he humiliated us so much. Once he's out of Necropolis City, whether he gets the key for us or not, I must have him killed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I hate anyone named Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Callista finished speaking, Frederick remained silent for a long time before slowly saying, "You still can't let go of those trivial matters! What's the point? She's already dead! Osborne was also driven out of the Palace and the Glorious Divine Kingdom by me, maybe he's already dead out there..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! Not necessarily!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That vile woman's body disappeared from her tomb! Her child's body wasn't found either! Who knows if they're still alive? I won't give up until I find them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Suit yourself!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick said no more, returning to that indifferent look. Even if everyone now thought the Royal Family was disgraced, even if he was the highest authority, he didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he cared about was power!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as he could gain the power he dreamed of in Necropolis City, he wouldn't care even if everyone in the Royal Family died!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne wins! Advances to the top five!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Zorro saw that Prince Matthew could no longer stand on his own and had to declare Osborne the winner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next match, Prince Sean versus Leroy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please step into the ring!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro quickly announced the start of the next match, as if doing so would leave others with less time to mock the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Out of the nine princes and princesses sent by the Royal Family, three have already been defeated by regular contestants!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, they can't afford to lose again!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the Royal Family members knew that if they lost again, it would truly be a disgrace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, Evernight Court and Phantom Commerce Guild would surely mock them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The next two matches, we must win!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, some Royal Family members even started praying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Leroy stepped onto the arena under such circumstances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her opponent was Sean, ranked sixth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean's expression was extremely serious. He no longer had his previous confidence and pride because even stronger opponents like Matthew and Yunus had already been defeated. He simply couldn't afford to be proud anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want to lose!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want to become part of the Royal Family's disgrace!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared intently at Leroy, took a deep breath, and refrained from provoking his opponent like the other princes and princesses had.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bring it on!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy directly took out the Legendary Sacred Artifact Spear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the two were locked in a fierce battle. Both wielded Legendary Sacred Artifacts, with equal power and similar strength. The arena was immediately filled with terrifying energy, collisions, explosions, and a chaotic yet intense scene.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This battle was incredibly intense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It could even be said to be the most intense battle since the start of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was anxiously waiting for the outcome of the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Will the Royal Family continue to lose face, or will another dark horse fall? Everything is about to be revealed.</span></p></div>
