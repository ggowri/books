        <h1>Chapter 2224 Where to Go-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft's face paled in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a panicked shout. "What?! No! You can't kill me! If you do, Scottie won't let you get away with it! The Phantom Commerce Guild will come after you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold chuckle. "You really think you're that big a deal to them? Besides, for the Phantom Commerce Guild to come after me, they first need to know where I am. So, you'd better just accept your fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, he tightened his grip around Bancroft's throat, gradually increasing the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft's eyes bulged with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd thought that letting Osborne know his connection to the Phantom Commerce Guild would make the latter hesitate, that it would persuade Osborne to hand over the slaves and spare his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't have been more wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne showed not a shred of fear of the Phantom Commerce Guild and was hell-bent on killing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is he really not scared of the Phantom Commerce Guild's revenge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft wondered, but he didn't have time to dwell on that thought. With a quick jerk, Osborne snapped his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ruler and the most powerful warrior of Necoton Planet, Bancroft, was now dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right away, Osborne activated Satan's Eye, sealing away both Bancroft's and Vince's memories deep in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he closed his eyes and started delving into them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, he opened his eyes again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started with Vince's memories, and after some time, he finally found the memories related to the slaves from Celestara Planet that dated back twenty years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne searched carefully, and suddenly, a jolt of excitement coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Vince's memories, he spotted his parents&mdash;bound like ordinary slaves in chains, ultimately sold to the Frenetic Storm Warband through a Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth, his eyes filled with fierce determination. "Just as I thought, it's the Frenetic Storm Warband!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frenetic Storm Warband... you better watch out! One day, I will find you! You'd better pray that my parents are still alive and haven't been tortured by you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I'll make you pay a thousandfold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that whispered threat, Osborne turned his attention back to Bancroft's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the entrance to the cavern opened again, and a dozen warships flew in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced up. "Ascending Sacred Sanctum, smash them to pieces! Isa, the rest is up to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he spoke, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum reduced the approaching warships to a heap of scrap. The crew members on those ships were killed in large numbers, and those who managed to survive were quickly taken care of by Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst all the chaos, Osborne stayed focused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quietly rummaged through Bancroft's memories, hoping to find a way to get in touch with Scottie or directly reach the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly, his search turned up empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scottie only contacted Bancroft when he needed something; he never initiated contact on his own. The only way to communicate was through the Phantom Commerce Guild's special channels when Scottie wanted Bancroft to prepare slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft didn't have the authority to reach out to Scottie, let alone the Frenetic Storm Warband, which he'd never even attempted to contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a bummer!" Osborne opened his eyes, annoyed that Bancroft's memories hadn't provided any useful information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Looks like I'll have to figure this out on my own!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It's time to make my way to Racial Convergence Planet! There, I might be able to find an intelligence network that can help me track down the Frenetic Storm Warband. And since Scottie is there too, if I can find him, I'll be able to solve everything!</span><span>"</span></p></div>
