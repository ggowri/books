        <h1>Chapter 1652 Change the Plan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hidden behind a tree, Osborne and Diana witnessed the brutal ambush as Algernon and his team were mercilessly encircled by the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made no move to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could have easily dispatched all the Deathborn and saved the exploration team; there was nothing stopping him from ensuring that not a single member would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, deep down, he questioned the very notion of doing so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why should he help them? What had they ever done to earn his assistance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had warned them before about the Deathborn trailing behind. If only Algernon hadn't been so arrogant, dismissive of Osborne's advice, and it might have been a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they had to do was to take his warning seriously and send someone to scout the area, confirming that Osborne was right; they might have averted this disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Algernon had chosen scorn, even going so far as to insult Osborne's very existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other explorers had followed suit, throwing barbs and mockery in Osborne's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In light of this, what reason did he have to save them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't a saint, nor did he feel obliged to rescue anyone. He had already shown remarkable restraint by not taking action against Algernon and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of their demise stirred not a flicker of emotion within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coolly, "Let's get moving. It's just the two of us from here on out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, it's a relief to leave behind those dead weights; we can make better progress this way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded, her expression a blend of shock and resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she was stunned by the brutal fate that had befallen Algernon's team, she felt no sympathy for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had effectively sealed their own fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we sticking to the original route?" she asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, then shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've decided to change the plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him in surprise. "Change the plan? What's the new strategy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, a glint of determination sparking in his eyes, "Soon, Deity King Angelo will lead a contingent of warriors from the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan into Divine Peak Nine. Their goal is the same as ours which was the Celestial Crystal mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their group will number over a hundred, at least all of them Deity Overlords. I think we should trail behind them and let them blaze the path."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at him, wide-eyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're going to secretly follow the Deity King's party? Let them scout for us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the safest route to reach the Celestial Crystal mining site! Divine Peak Nine is too strange and perilous&mdash;even I can't be sure I can spot every danger in advance. If an unforeseen threat pops up, we'll have a real pickle on our hands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if we stay behind the Deity King's contingent, they'll serve as our shield. Even if unexpected dangers arise, they'll lead the charge in revealing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just need to be careful and avoid detection; then we can smoothly follow them to the mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana fell silent as she weighed his words, finally nodding in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll go along with your plan. I just worry about being noticed by the Deity King warrior. Their senses are definitely sharper than ours, and if we're caught tailing them, we'd be in serious trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip, concern etched across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To most practitioners, the strength of a Deity King warrior remained a mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, one thing was certain. They were incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the most seasoned Deity Overlords would find themselves mere insects, easily crushed underfoot in front of a true Deity King warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For them, those Deity King warriors posed a far greater danger than the Deathborn lurking in Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered her concern, saying, "As long as we keep our distance, we shouldn't raise any alarms. If the Deity King warriors truly had such extraordinary senses, then Divine Peak Nine wouldn't have seen four of them overrun and killed by the Deathborn army!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as we tread lightly, we should be fine. Besides, if we do get caught, we can always make our escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence radiated from Osborne as he spoke, a calm certainty in his demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was less afraid of a Deity King warrior. After all, his space elemental essence had reached Level Seven, giving him an almost terrifying control over space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if a Deity King warrior pursued him, Osborne was confident he could use his spatial power to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he feared more was the unknown!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Peak Nine made him uneasy; it was fraught with too many unknown dangers. Until he had a better understanding, Osborne was unwilling to recklessly delve deeper into Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the Deity King's team was much safer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Osborne needed to figure out a way to disrupt Angelo's plans, to prevent them from reaching the Celestial Crystal mine and obtaining the Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By staying close to Angelo's team, he could act more opportunistically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll follow your lead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded in agreement when she saw that Osborne had made up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two found a place to rest, and Diana wasted no time, diving back into her training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't idle either, creating two clones to explore the surroundings while he himself began communicating with Riley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley, from the Soaring Lion Clan, was a mid-stage Deity Overlord, and he had naturally been required by Angelo to join the exploration team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through Riley, Osborne could get all the information about Angelo's team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Right now, Angelo's team was gathering.</span></p></div>
