        <h1>Chapter 2241 Sign Up-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After murmuring his thoughts, Earvin decided to let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Osborne's entry into the Sect Tournament felt more like a detour&mdash;a small surprise. If it hadn't been for the fact that Peak Seven had so many core disciples who knew they had little hope of breaking into the top ten and thus opted out, leaving open slots for participation, he likely wouldn't have even considered letting Osborne take part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Peak Seven has twenty-eight slots filled for the Sect Tournament, and we're still missing two. What's going on? Why is no one signing up? Those core disciples know they might not make it, but at least they should join just for the experience! If we don't fill all the slots, it'll be a real shame for Peak Seven!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow, contemplating possible candidates.</span><br><span>What about asking Maddox to sign up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he immediately dismissed the idea.</span><br><span>"</span><span>Nah, Maddox is only at Ascension Nine. Sure, he ranks seventh in the inner circle, but against the competition in the tournament, he'd be outmatched and probably humiliated! He's my apprentice, after all; if he gets crushed, it'll be like a slap in the face for me!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earvin sighed, running a hand through his hair, "I need to talk to some of the inner disciples from Peak Seven and see if anyone's still willing to jump in on this. There has to be someone willing to take a chance..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he left, determined to rally the remaining inner disciples and fill those last slots for the tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in his quarters, Osborne immediately reinforced his Sacred Power defenses and activated a time acceleration technique, speeding up the surrounding time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>For the next half month, I'm going to push my limits! With my current strength, getting into the top ten at the Mystic Sirius Sect's Sect Tournament shouldn't be too difficult. But then there's the city duel in Tempest Fortress City, the state duel in Zephyr State, and the Eastern Zone 3 zone duel.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I need to carve my path through all these challenges and rack up as many </span><span>Kingdom</span><span> Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> as possible! After all, there are always stronger opponents out there, and I can't underestimate the possibility of running into some super geniuses who could block my way!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>No matter what, I have to make it to Nebula City to compete in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Nothing is going to stop me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce determination in his eyes, Osborne began his seclusion training. He knew that compared to his </span><span>competitors,</span><span> his biggest weakness was his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But breaking through to higher levels wasn't something that could happen overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye at the Sacredness Level was already absorbing Sacred Crystal energy at an impressive rate, but jumping to Ascension Eight, Nine, or even Ten in a short time was still unrealistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to let things unfold naturally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>My greatest strengths are my Sacred Power and my mid-level </span><span>Infinite Sacred Body!</span><span> </span><span>The fusion of spatial and dark energy gives me an edge in both offense and defense compared to my competitors.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But I know I'm not the only one at the Supernal Deity King Level with Sacred Power. I need to keep enhancing its power and blend in more forces.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Then there's my weapon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow is a quasi-Sacred Artifact, and it's usually more than enough. In Mystic Sirius Sect, there aren't many who possess a true Sacred Artifact! Still, when I enter the city duel, state duel, or even the zone duel, most of my opponents will likely come from First-rate Powers, and they might wield Sacred Artifacts!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If that happens, the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow won't just be a disadvantage; it could put me at serious risk! I need to upgrade it to the Sacredness Level and transform it into a true Sacred Artifact!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Plus, my mastery over space, dark, and lightning elemental essences is still only at mid-Level Ten&mdash;I haven't reached the peak yet! I need to keep pushing those limits.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his thoughts crystallized and a clear set of goals in mind, Osborne dove headfirst into his training. His exceptional understanding of cultivation began to shine, rapidly boosting his strength as he focused all his energy on improvement.</span></p></div>
