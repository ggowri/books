        <h1>Chapter 2327 Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coming in at the eighth spot, Lincoln was an outrageously powerful warrior hailing from a relatively unknown race&mdash;the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though this clan was part of the Human Community, its unique traits set it apart, making it a recognized entity on its own. Unlike Lord Malevolence, who tried to set up his Paramount Supreme Clan but couldn't gain recognition beyond Celestara Planet, the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan was a well-known name across the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clan's reputation was built on the back of its legendary ancestor, the Invincible Battle Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This badass lived thousands of years ago when the Racial Convergence Planet was under the thumb of a tyrannical force called the Overpowering Dynasty. The rulers of the Overpowering Dynasty were as cruel as they came. They treated the living beings on the Racial Convergence Planet like dirt, more like slaves and livestock than sentient beings. Life there was a living hell, a real dog-eat-dog world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, back then, the Racial Convergence Planet was nicknamed the Dark Planet, a place shrouded in eternal darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of this tyranny, twelve top-notch warriors from different races got together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They called themselves the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet. They banded together and launched a full-on rebellion against the Overpowering Dynasty. With their incredible might and by rallying all sorts of forces, they fought tooth and nail. In the end, they managed to bring the tyrannical Overpowering Dynasty to its knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three of these heavyweights were from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was Solomon Augustine, the guy who founded the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there was his wife, Darlene Marjory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third one was Armand Sanders, the Invincible Battle Overlord, who was the ancestor of the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armand had this freaky-cool ability. In the heat of battle, he could jack up his power exponentially. He called it the Battle Warrior's Rampage State. Once he slipped into this state, he got scarier and scarier, like there was no ceiling to how powerful he could get. His mad skills were a game-changer in the war against the Overpowering Dynasty, and they eventually bit the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armand was so impressed with his own ability that he decided to cook up a clan that could inherit this power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was how the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan was born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the real deal, recognized far and wide across the entire Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clan's always been a small fry, but every member can tap into the Battle Warrior's Rampage State. Sure, their abilities might not hold a candle to Armand's legendary might, but they're still no joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They just kept getting stronger with each fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln, a real proud peacock from this clan, had now stepped into his Battle Warrior's Rampage State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His golden-hued skin and the glowing Sacred Power were like a neon sign, showing he was in the zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden fist-force collided head-on with Osborne's Sacred Power arrow. In the blink of an eye, the fist-force went up in smithereens. Meanwhile, the Sacred Power arrow kept on blazing a trail towards Lincoln at a jaw-dropping speed, undeterred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of getting the jitters, Lincoln felt a rush of pure excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! Hit me with your best shot!" he roared, raining down punches like a hailstorm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each punch, the arrows started to lose their edge under the sheer force of his blows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they reached Lincoln, they'd already taken a beating from his powerful strikes and finally gave way under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, this is the real deal! This feels amazing!" Lincoln laughed, his eyes lighting up as he saw Osborne's second arrow hurtling towards him at breakneck speed.</span></p></div>
