        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With General Ian Augustine's strength, he can definitely find out who killed the Magma Devourer! No matter how well that being hides, as long as they&rsquo;ve moved on this Abyssal Planet, they&rsquo;re bound to leave traces, which General Ian Augustine will pinpoint!" Gerald murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shook his head, stopped overthinking, and ordered, "Let's go. It's time for us to head back! The contestants have all gathered near the Cosmic Translocator. We should also return and see who will stand out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time's zone duel had too many unexpected events, causing us to be constantly battling the Magma Devourer, leaving no time to focus on the contestants' situations."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We have no idea who will win the championship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, a referee said, "The champion must be Brenda! Her biggest rival, Valentino, was killed by the Magma Devourer on the second day of the zone duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, she united almost all the contestants to jointly resist the attacks of the Native Creatures on Abyssal Planet, gaining a massive amount of resources."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rumor has it, she even possesses a Legendary Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's a Legendary Sacred Artifact. Mr. Norton, even though you've reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, you don't have one! Brenda is just a disciple below Empyrean Sacredness, yet Skyearth Dominion granted her a Legendary Sacred Artifact. It's truly enviable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald couldn't help but smile wryly upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, even though I've reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, in terms of talent and potential, I can't compare to Brenda at all! Skyearth Dominion is one of the strongest First-rate Powers, wealthy and generous. It's normal for them to give Brenda a Legendary Sacred Artifact. Envy is useless!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, envy is useless! Mr. Norton, if you had a Legendary Sacred Artifact, dealing with the Magma Devourer wouldn't have been so difficult, and so many comrades wouldn't have died."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it, let's not talk about these upsetting things!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, this time in the Eastern Zone 3 zone duel, Brenda is definitely the champion! With her strength, even if she participates in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel six months later, she'll surely perform well and bring glory to our Eastern Zone 3!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The key now is who will take second and third place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald listened to everyone's discussion, shook his head, and said, "You're too optimistic! I agree that Brenda can win the zone duel, but for her to achieve good results in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and bring glory to Eastern Zone 3, that's way too difficult!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's almost impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald's words left all the judges stunned, looking at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Norton, why do you say that? Brenda's strength is just below Empyrean Sacredness. She's almost the strongest, right? Plus, she has the Legendary Sacred Artifact, the Ice Scepter. The geniuses selected from the other nine zones are at most on the same cultivation level as her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With Brenda's strength, even if she can't win the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, she can at least make it to the top ten, maybe even compete for the top five or top three."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at Gerald in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald sneered, "Brenda's strength is below Empyrean Sacredness. Is she the strongest? Not necessarily! This world is unfair. Sometimes, your greatest achievement is merely someone else's starting point!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel is different from before!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the past, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel selected the ten strongest geniuses from each region, with a total of one hundred top talents competing. Under such rules, Brenda had a great chance of making it to the top ten, maybe even competing for the top five or top three!"</span></p></div>
