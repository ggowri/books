        <h1>Chapter 2252 Clinched the Championship!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar opted for close combat with Osborne, but Osborne showed no signs of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His physique was incredibly powerful, having reached the mid-stage of the Infinite Sacred Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gave him a terrifying physical strength that he rarely had the opportunity to showcase. In fact, even when facing powerful beings from the Sacred Dragon or Sacred Tiger Clans at the same cultivation level, Osborne felt utterly confident he could overpower them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with his physical strength augmented by Sacred Power, his might was even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Jamar fully unleashing his power&mdash;utilizing the trump card he had prepared for Vadim, along with his quasi-Sacred Artifact lightning hammers&mdash;Osborne was still unfazed, standing there barehanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resounding bang, Osborne's fist struck the lightning hammers with tremendous force, creating a deafening explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crackling energy surrounding the hammers shattered instantly, sending the massive weapons flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer recoil of the impact caused blood to burst from Jamar's hands. He let out a pained scream as his body was propelled backward, crashing heavily onto the ground beneath the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne slowly drew back his fist, his expression calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence descended upon the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, both Osborne's supporters and Jamar's fans were struck dumb with disbelief. Their cheers died on their lips, replaced by a stunned hush as they tried to wrap their heads around what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many had expected Osborne to beat Jamar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, even Vadim couldn't take two of Osborne's arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar was strong, no doubt about it, but at best he was on a par with Vadim. Without any special tricks up his sleeve, it was only natural for him to fall to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one had expected Jamar to be defeated so comprehensively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't even touched his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd taken Jamar down with his bare hands, shattering the attack from a quasi-Sacred Artifact and sending Jamar flying out of the arena, injured and beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective gasp swept through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said Osborne only knows how to fire arrows with his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow? Who claimed close-range combat was his Achilles' heel? Step forward and own up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unreal! Osborne isn't just a sharpshooter who took down Vadim with two arrows from afar. He can also throw a punch that sends Jamar flying! He's a force to be reckoned with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least within the Mystic Sirius Sect, there's not a single disciple who can go toe-to-toe with Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just hand him the trophy right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even in Tempest Fortress City, with his skills, Osborne could easily make it into the top three! It's been a century since the Mystic Sirius Sect last landed in the top three during the city duel, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, Osborne will surely bring glory to the Mystic Sirius Sect in the city duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's excitement reached a fever pitch as they chattered about the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne's powerful punch sent Jamar flying, no one had any doubts that he would take the crown in the Sect Tournament. Even though Bethan hadn't faced Osborne yet, nobody thought she could hold a candle to his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was just in a league of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at the betting booths, they stopped taking bets on Osborne winning. The odds of Bethan coming out on top had shot up to a staggering hundred to one, which showed that even the bookies thought Osborne's victory was a done deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent!" Angela was practically vibrating with excitement. When Jamar had whipped out his quasi-Sacred Artifact lightning hammers and charged at Osborne, she'd felt a pang of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd assumed most of Osborne's strength came from his archery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How well could he really do in hand-to-hand combat? Could he still beat Jamar?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she watched what went down, it was obvious she'd underestimated Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't just a crack shot with a bow; his close-range fighting skills were even more jaw-dropping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How on earth is he so powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela could scarcely believe what she was seeing. A sudden rush of eagerness swept over her, and she felt an urge to get in touch with Adriana right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a talent like Osborne, with his skills and might, the Fairy Moon Sect would be making a huge blunder if they didn't try to recruit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe I should just sit back and see how things play out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect still have a long way to go. They're just a Second-rate Power, and even among them, they're near the bottom. There aren't any real stand-out talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought about the other two Second-rate Powers in Tempest Fortress City&mdash;Azure Haven Academy and Fantasia Isle. Their strength completely outshone that of the Mystic Sirius Sect. Throughout history, those two had always dominated the top three spots in the city duel, making it an uphill battle for the Mystic Sirius Sect disciples to make a mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'll wait and see how Osborne does in the city duel. If he can keep up his winning streak, maybe even break into the top three or take the championship, then I'll definitely contact Ms. Alba! I'll urge her to invite Osborne to join Fairy Moon Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Talent like his is something we can't afford to overlook!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Angela turned her gaze back to Osborne, feeling a swell of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, several Peak Lords and Elders from other peaks approached her, offering their congratulations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen, congratulations! Osborne from Peak Seven is likely to secure the Sect Tournament championship without a doubt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! He's incredible! He's only at Ascension Eight, yet his power is such that even we Peak Lords would struggle against him at the same cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, the younger generation is something to behold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last time in the city duel, Vadim only managed fourth place, just shy of the top three. This time, Osborne's even stronger, and he has a real shot at representing Mystic Sirius Sect in the top ranks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been a hundred years since we've placed in the top three in the city duel, hasn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, we're counting on Osborne from Peak Seven!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela couldn't help but beam at the compliments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she quickly chimed in, "Folks, let's not build him up too much! He's still only at the Ascension Eight level, and he's got a long road ahead. We elders shouldn't pile on the pressure. I'll give him a nudge to go all out in the city duel and bring glory to the Mystic Sirius Sect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A ripple of laughter spread around her, easing the atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the arena, Osborne's win over Jamar had set the stage for his later matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every opponent he was up against next threw in the towel without a second thought, leaving Osborne with a mounting list of victories without even having to set foot on the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, the battles on the second day came to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the third and final day of the competition kicked off, only two combatants remained unscathed&mdash;Osborne and Bethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne squared off against Bethan, she didn't flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she decided to go all out. Her strength had grown since their previous showdown, but there was still a vast gulf between her power and Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne drew his bow and loosed an arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Bethan pulled out all the stops, she couldn't hold up against the onslaught. Osborne effortlessly pierced through her divine power defense and beat her without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, there was no one left to take on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had clinched the championship!</span></p></div>
