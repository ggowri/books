        <h1>Chapter 1272 The Descent of Despair</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crap! The Deschanel Clan reinforcements are here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope they're not sending any Transcendent Deity warriors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of panic rippled through the Augustine family as they braced themselves for the worst. The tension in the air was palpable, their faces etched with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could sense the battle between the God of Star and Eamon but struggled to grasp its full extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, it was clear that God of Star held a slight edge, though turning that advantage into victory would take time they didn't have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the reinforcements from the Deschanel Clan turned out to be just a few Superior Deities, Sebastian and his team could throw themselves into the fray, buying time to protect the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Transcendent Deities were involved, they'd be out of luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They prayed fervently, but their hopes were dashed when two Transcendent Deity warriors from the Deschanel Clan emerged, each crowned with four Divine Flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The color drained from Sebastian's face as despair settled in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two Transcendent Deities... It's like they want to wipe the Augustine family off the map! Compared to these divine clans that have existed since the Age of Gods, we're just too weak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bitterness of that thought weighed heavily on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Deschanel Clan had sent just one Transcendent Deity, they might have managed to stall for time, hoping the God of Star could defeat her opponent before they were all wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with two Transcendent Deities joining Eamon, that hope vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their efforts to stall, even if it cost them their lives, were rendered futile!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three Transcendent Deities against God of Star?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a losing battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if to confirm their fears, the clash between God of Star and Eamon abruptly halted, both warriors stepping back to reassess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star's expression was grave, while Eamon wore a smug grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Star, your time is up!" he taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star merely snorted, refusing to engage with his bravado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, standing nearby, let out a heavy sigh. "God of Star, thank you for helping the Augustine family, but you need to leave now! You don't have to risk your life for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star frowned, her face a mask of conflict and turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she knew that fleeing was the wisest choice. With her strength, even if all three Transcendent Deities attacked together, they wouldn't be able to catch her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could she just run away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would be a betrayal to Osborne, who had saved her from being a mere fragment of a soul. Moreover, he was Isa's man!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resolute shake of her head, she declared, "I've made my point. I won't run! Where's Osborne? Why hasn't he shown up yet? If he doesn't get here soon, I won't be able to hold them off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian couldn't help but wear a wry smile at her insistence on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Why does the God of Star keep mentioning Osborne as if his appearance could turn the tide of battle? To me, even if Osborne were here, it wouldn't make a dent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan has mobilized three Transcendent Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne emerged from his seclusion as an Intermediate Deity, what good would that do against the Transcendent Deity's power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if every Blood Demon member ascended to godhood, they'd still be outmatched by three Transcendent Deities, wouldn't they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian struggled to see what advantage Osborne's presence could possibly offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, God of Star, Osborne is currently in seclusion. We've tried to wake him, but there's an overwhelming force outside his training chamber that we can't get past. We can't reach him, let alone rouse him," Sebastian explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, Sebastian felt the weight of despair settle over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This must be our fate as the Augustine family. God of Star, you've already done more than enough for us. Even Osborne wouldn't blame you for leaving. Please, just go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll face whatever comes next on our own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determination flared in his eyes as he turned to Anastasia, Bryce, Matthew, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you see an opening, you need to run. Find a place to hide! With your talents, given some time, you'll rise to power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And when you do, avenge us! Avenge the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian gripped the Godfather's scepter tightly, his face a mask of unwavering resolve, ready to face whatever doom awaited them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon, standing nearby, sneered, "Run? Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family can't escape this time! The Deschanel Clan won't give you a single opportunity to flee! You've got secrets that let every family member attain a Level Three Divine Body upon becoming a deity. How could we possibly let you slip away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll all become slaves to the Deschanel Clan&mdash;our dogs! No one can save you, not even her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Eamon finished his taunt, a surge of powerful auras suddenly materialized around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five, ten, no&mdash;twelve Superior Deities suddenly appeared, encircling the Augustine Estate within a six-mile area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all sported cold, mocking smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's heart sank as he took in the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twelve Superior Deities? This is a nightmare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the chill of despair creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over! There's no way we can escape now!"</span></p></div>
