        <h1>Chapter 2147 Isidore's Response-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heart of the colossal Ethereal Elven Temple, Isidore stood clad in a resplendent white robe adorned with golden accents, the embodiment of divine elegance. Yet, his face was contorted with fury, his voice erupting in a roar of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His rage swirled through the temple, the Sacred Power within pulsating dangerously in response to his tumultuous emotions. All around him, the clergy of the temple fell to their knees in terror, fear plastered across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Why?! Why did the rules of Umbra Earth find out about my soul?! If only I had a bit more time, I could've seized the Ascending Sacred Sanctum!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, I've got nothing to show for it&mdash;just the crippling loss of one of my origin souls, and the Sublime Concealment Orb!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore gritted his teeth, his blood boiling with unrestrained killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should have exuded the grace like a divine being, but at that moment, he resembled a furious demon, seething with uncontained fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he simply couldn't help seething with rage. To get his hands on the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, Isidore had pulled out all the stops. He'd been so damn confident, thinking he had it in the bag. But in the end, all his efforts went down the drain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Isidore fail to acquire the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, but he also ended up losing the Sublime Concealment Orb and a fragment of his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a colossal blunder and an absolute rip-off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After venting his fury like a raging bull, Isidore still couldn't cool his jets. He paced back and forth in the massive temple, his face growing icier by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole temple was now shrouded in a thick cloud of negative energy. It was so intense that everyone in there was holding their breaths, tiptoeing around as if walking on eggshells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore muttered, "Ascending Sacred Sanctum..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ethereal Elven Temple, this divine artifact-level palace, was a jewel among the structures of Elf City, representing nobility and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously satisfied with his place here, Isidore now gazed upon its grandeur with disdain, resentful of its inadequacy when compared to the overwhelming promise of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in its damaged state, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum surpassed the temple by leagues&mdash;it was a treasure that held power beyond his wildest dreams, and now it had slipped through his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glinted with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "It's mine! It was meant to be mine! You damn human, I gave you the means to retrieve the Ascending Sacred Sanctum from that Umbra Earth continent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Don't let me down! If you manage to bring it back, I will find you and reclaim what is rightfully mine! Just wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathing heavily, Isidore forced himself to rein in his fury, taking a moment to recalibrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without delay, a figure appeared before him, bowing respectfully. "Mr. Isidore Rosedale!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find out everything about that human who entered Umbra Earth with Alfreda. Where did he come from? Who does he know? I want to know everything! And keep your eyes on Elf City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Umbra Earth continent is about to return to the Umbra World! As soon as that human shows his face, inform me immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!" the figure replied, disappearing swiftly to fulfill the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore scowled, muttering, "That human must have the Ascending Sacred Sanctum now. Knowing I would hunt him down, he probably won't dare to return to Elf City! He'll use a Spatial Translocator to get back to his home planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'll uncover where he's from! If he lived in Elf City, he would have left traces behind, and I will find them! You can't escape!</span></p></div>
