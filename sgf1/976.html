        <h1>Chapter 976 Supporting the Lambert Family</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the conference room, Osborne gathered the senior members for an urgent meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Lambert family has stood by us for generations. Now that they're in trouble and reaching out for help, we can't just sit back and do nothing. We must rescue them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone present was already aware of the situation, their faces etched with concern and worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Declan said seriously, "Godfather, the Augustine family is currently in turmoil. We can barely defend ourselves, let alone mount a rescue for the Lambert family. With the Eityreia Organization as our opponent, those assassins are incredibly terrifying and masterful at hiding. If we send too few people, we won't just be unable to help the Lambert family; we might endanger ourselves in the process.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And if we send too many, our own defenses could crumble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Declan Augustine is right. I even suspect this might be a scheme from the Eityreia Organization, aiming to force us to send people to rescue them and then strike a heavy blow against us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I agree. It's entirely possible this is a trap."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne surveyed the room, his voice calm yet firm. "I understand your concerns, but I've made my decision. I'll go to the Lambert family alone to provide assistance. The rest of you will stay here to protect the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With the Draco Armed Services Branch and the Blood Demon members already stationed here, I'm confident they can hold the fort. Unless we face a massive assault, the Augustine family will be safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his declaration, the members' expressions hardened dramatically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, Godfather! You can't go alone! This is the Eityreia Organization we're talking about!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Lambert family is a superpower in its own right, and their head is a Class S warrior. The fact they're calling for help indicates the strength of the assassins sent by Eityreia Organization; they're likely Class S, too. While you're a formidable fighter, facing an assassin of that caliber is immensely risky."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, please think it over, Godfather!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They all urged, with Wesson included, opposing his reckless plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the top assassins from the Eityreia Organization wouldn't hesitate to eliminate any threat, and the danger was simply too great for Osborne to take on alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne interrupted, his tone steely but calm, "Enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've made my choice, and I won't be swayed! The Lambert family has helped me in the past, and Ms. Aleena Lambert is a friend of Mr. Caleb Augustine, who died to protect me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No matter the risks, I must go to help the Lambert family! I know you're worried about my safety and those terrifying assassins from the Eityreia Organization, but it's precisely their fearsome nature that drives my decision to go alone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I possess spatial power; if I need to escape, few could stop me. I'll head over first to assess the situation. If it proves too perilous, I won't push my luck."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he finished speaking, the room remained tense with furrowed brows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, looking into Osborne's resolute eyes, they ultimately fell silent, unable to argue further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So it was settled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne resolved to go to the Lambert family, but he wouldn't leave the Augustine family vulnerable. He discreetly handed the Godfather's Scepter to Emma for safekeeping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In its current state, the scepter could only unleash its full potential within the borders of the Augustine Estate. Taking it to the Lambert family's place would be pointless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma was the one he trusted most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During his absence, if top Class S warriors were to attack the Augustine family, with Emma wielding the scepter, God of Star working behind the scenes, and the support of Blood Demon members and the Draco Armed Services Branch, he believed they would weather the storm without major issues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After doing all this, Osborne finally tore open a dimensional rift and stepped inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Lambert family had sought refuge in Pelycosaur Mountain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over four hundred years ago, they found themselves embroiled in a fierce battle with their enemies. Although they triumphed in the end, the victory came at a heavy cost, nearly leading to their annihilation. To ensure their lineage would continue, the Lambert family retreated to Pelycosaur Mountain, where they began their secluded life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, the Augustine family resided nearby, an Ancient Family with deep roots in the land.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From that moment on, the relationship between the Augustine and Lambert families blossomed into a strong alliance, with both sides often lending a helping hand to each other, allowing them to stave off the threats from their foes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two centuries ago, the Augustine family relocated to Newport City, yet the bond remained unbroken, especially among their leaders, who maintained close ties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, in the wake of an assault by the Eityreia Organization on the Lambert family, the first call for help came from the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne soon arrived near Pelycosaur Mountain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought, "The Lambert family is just a Secluded Family, staying out of any disputes. So why is the Eityreia Organization targeting them? And it seems they're intent on wiping out the Lambert family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could it be because of Rhett?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back in Tethynia, the Eityreia Organization had already been gunning for the Lambert family, seemingly because Rhett had once saved a woman, which had apparently earned the ire of a high-ranking figure within Eityreia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "How many top-notch assassins has that organization sent after them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Forget that for now. I'll check on the Lambert family first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a final whisper of determination, Osborne ripped open another dimensional rift. The next moment, he found himself standing amidst a realm of ancient architecture, the very heart of the Lambert family's sanctuary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, he was hit by a visceral wave of metallic tang in the air&mdash;the unmistakable scent of blood.</p></div>
