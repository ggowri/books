        <h1>Chapter 2510 Success</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, let your pet take action and kill this disgusting woman first!" Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum immediately nodded. In fact, she had been holding back for a long time. If she weren't still in her infancy and lacked any combat ability, she would have personally taken out this disgusting woman already.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, receiving Osborne's order, she immediately took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My little pet darlings, come out, a few of you, and kill this disgusting woman! Don't eat her! She's too disgusting!" Drum said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She opened the Dimensional Microcosm, and instantly, more than a dozen Silver Beetles flew out, each emanating an aura of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had all reached mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than a dozen mid Empyrean Sacredness Silver Beetles received Drum's order and swiftly charged at the woman, instantly making the air in the small courtyard feel frozen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman reacted quickly too, showing a look of surprise. Realizing something was wrong, she immediately tried to escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, more than a dozen Silver Beetles spewed silvery-white streams from their mouths, quickly enveloping the woman. Without any chance to react, she was instantly frozen in place, becoming a naked ice sculpture.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Done!" Drum said happily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne's expression was serious because he knew that even though the woman was dealt with, Layne was still not out of danger. This woman was merely a puppet controlled by the mastermind behind Blossom Cage. Now that something had happened to her, the mastermind must have noticed the anomaly and would likely show up quickly or send someone to handle the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, the most important thing is to get Layne out of Blossom Cage safely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, let him enter your Dimensional Microcosm!" Osborne commanded quickly. At that moment, Osborne's Satan's Eye suddenly caught sight of a figure rushing toward Layne's courtyard at incredible speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was Romina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Romina, a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, was now bursting with Sacred Power, her face grim as she charged toward the courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression instantly turned serious. "Drum, hurry up! An Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior is heading your way! Get Layne into your Dimensional Microcosm quickly, then come back immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum dared not delay for a moment and directly ordered the Silver Beetles to release silver streams, freezing the weakened Layne into an ice sculpture.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the Silver Beetles swiftly carried Layne back to the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the moment Layne disappeared, Romina rushed into the courtyard and immediately saw the woman frozen into an ice sculpture, her expression growing even darker.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly searched the courtyard but didn&rsquo;t find Layne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!" Romina muttered under her breath. "You can't escape! No one can get out of the Blossom Cage! No one..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Romina's lips moved slightly, as if she were saying something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Drum had quickly returned to the courtyard, landing on Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne patted Drum's head. "Drum, well done!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne immediately prepared to leave the Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, his expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He noticed that everyone in the Blossom Cage had started moving, with hundreds of different women guarding every corridor of the Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the Blossom Cage, another, even stronger defensive shield appeared, completely enveloping the Blossom Cage. Osborne felt that this shield was comparable to the defense of Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least for now, even with his most powerful Heaven Arrow, he couldn't shake it in the slightest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't leave now!" Osborne thought quickly. "I just got here and haven't spent anything yet. If I leave in a hurry now, it will definitely raise suspicion."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, they definitely won't let anyone leave before finding Layne in the Blossom Cage. Otherwise, the secrets of the Blossom Cage might be exposed. If I get suspected by the Blossom Cage, it will be even more troublesome."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmed down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now that Layne is in hand, I just need to quickly get the information about the Frenetic Storm Warband from him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly formed a Spatial Clone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let the Spatial Clone stay in the courtyard, pretending to rest, while Osborne's true body quickly entered Drum's Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne saw Layne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Layne was frozen by the Silver Beetle, now resembling an ice sculpture. Osborne waved his hand, and Layne's frozen body quickly thawed, finally regaining consciousness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He found himself in a completely unfamiliar place and was instantly startled. Seeing that the terrifying and disgusting woman had disappeared, he immediately felt relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne, Layne asked, "Who are you? Did you save me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Saved you?" Osborne said with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Blossom Cage would soon send someone to his small courtyard, so he couldn't waste time and directly asked, "Are you Layne Dussel, the deputy leader of the Frenetic Storm Warband?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Layne sensed something off in Osborne's tone and cautiously said, "Yes, I am. What do you want?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have a few questions for you." Osborne quickly began asking. At first, Layne was reluctant to answer, and Osborne sensed he was using special methods to recover.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered coldly and immediately used methods on Layne. After some torment, Layne quickly became compliant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, whatever Osborne asked, Layne answered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finally got the information he wanted and couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he didn't dare to fully trust Layne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think it's better for you to die now. After you're dead, I'll search your memory to see if you really deceived me!" Osborne said, then took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Layne struggled desperately, he was too weak, and Osborne found it all too easy to kill him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Layne died.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't have time to check before his expression suddenly changed. He quickly left Drum's Dimensional Microcosm and returned to the small courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he appeared, the door of the small courtyard was opened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Romina led a group of Blossom Cage guards in with a cold expression. Her icy gaze instantly locked onto Osborne, filled with intense scrutiny.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression was calm, showing a look of confusion. "Ms. Hubbard, is there something you need? I was feeling a bit unwell just now and was resting..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Romina didn&rsquo;t speak immediately. She signaled to a guard behind her, who immediately began searching every corner of Osborne&rsquo;s small courtyard with a special Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Romina continued to stare at Osborne, her sharp eyes seemingly trying to see right through him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne met her gaze directly, showing no sign of fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even frowned and said, "May I ask, what do you want? I'm here as a customer. Although I haven't started spending yet because I felt unwell, you can't just barge in like this, can you? Is this how you treat your guests?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They say Blossom Cage has great service, but I doubt it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne showed an angry expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the guard had also searched the courtyard and shook his head at Romina. "Ms. Hubbard, nothing."</span></p></div>
