        <h1>Chapter 2181 We Meet Again</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his cultivation level soar to Ascension Four in a flash.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a massive Ascension Stairway descended from the sky, an awe-inspiring sight that seemed to stretch infinitely upward&mdash;a celestial ladder only a Supernal Deity King could tread.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every practitioner who had just transcended to become a Supernal Deity King, as well as those reaching Ascension Four, Ascension Seven, or Ascension Ten, would typically see the Ascension Stairway appear, an inevitable challenge they had to face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To continue their ascent, they had to pass the trials it presented; failure meant serious injuries or, in the worst case, death.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, the Ascension Stairway would land right before Osborne, forcibly pulling him into its testing grounds.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, that wasn't happening.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his amazement, the Ascension Stairway was obstructed! It was being held back by the protective barrier of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stairway could not draw Osborne into its field of challenge!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unexpected situation left Osborne momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascension Stairway is actually blocked by the Ascending Sacred Sanctum? Does this mean I could completely opt out of the trial if I wanted to?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chuckle escaped him as he contemplated this twist of fate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial, it seems the Ascension Stairway is barred from entry!" Osborne exclaimed, turning to his companion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial nodded knowingly. "That's actually quite normal!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mentioned before that the Ascension Stairway is merely a projection of a Sacred Artifact. It's a tool used by the Order of the Celestial Way to govern this cosmos&mdash;it's all part of their established rules.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, since you're under the protection of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum&mdash;which, despite its damages, is still a Sacred Artifact&mdash;it makes perfect sense that it could prevent the Ascension Stairway from reaching you.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial continued, his tone shifting to one of urgency, "However, I recommend you leave the the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and face the Ascension Stairway's trial! Yes, the challenge may be perilous, but if you can overcome it, your power will surely grow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"More importantly, if you stay here too long, the warriors of the Order of the Celestial Way might pick up on something being off. A little deduction on their part and they'll realize you possess a Sacred Artifact, which is why you've avoided the trial.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They could become very determined to find you and seize what you have! You definitely don't want that kind of trouble on your hands..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned at the thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what if I encounter an accident during the trial? I remember the last time I became a Supernal Deity King, the Ascension Stairway conjured a projection of a Sacred Tiger Clan warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He claimed I was an anomaly and tried to eliminate me! If I hadn't been strong enough, I might not be here now! He warned me that he'd come for me again when I reached Ascension Four..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shadow of concern flickered across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial burst into laughter, dismissing his worries. "What are you afraid of? That Sacred Tiger Clan warrior can only project a fraction of his power through the Ascension Stairway! Even with all his preparations, he'll still be limited.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You may only be at Ascension Four, but in reality, you could easily hold your ground against someone at Ascension Eight or Nine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why worry about a mere projection?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a perfect opportunity to test your current strength! And even if it gets dicey, remember, you have the Ascending Sacred Sanctum to fall back on. If things go south, just retreat to its protection, and unless the warrior's true self appears, he can't touch you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Primordial's words settled in, a spark ignited in Osborne's eyes, and he felt a rush of eagerness. The prospect of facing the trial began to thrill him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, determination shining in his eyes, "Primordial, you make a solid point! That Sacred Tiger Clan warrior was insufferably arrogant, thinking he could eliminate me like I was some kind of outcast! If he shows up again, he's definitely going to regret it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took a deep breath and, in a flash, left the protective confines of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand, retracting it as the Sanctum vanished into his grasp.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, the Ascension Stairway, no longer hindered by the Sanctum's barrier, locked onto Osborne's aura and pulled him onto its massive, celestial steps.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found himself standing firmly on the fourth level of the towering Ascension Stairway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low hum resonated through the air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, the trial began.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascension Stairway's challenges were unique for each individual: some faced brutal divine power attacks, others encountered soul-testing assaults, and some were put through trials of willpower.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For every Supernal Deity King, these trials felt like a true catastrophe&mdash;difficult, daunting, and something that could not be attempted without full preparation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The consequences of failure were severe, so the Ascension Stairway's trials were often referred to as the Deity King Tribulations.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To reach the pinnacle of Supernal Deity King and aim for Empyrean Sacredness, one would need to conquer four such tribulations: </span><span>at Ascension One, </span><span>at Ascension Four, Ascension Seven, and Ascension Ten.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Osborne was set to face his second Deity King Tribulation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, dark, swirling clouds materialized above his head, thick with ominous energy, expanding outward and casting a heavy pressure down upon him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then the tests began.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trials of the soul, trials of perseverance, tests of physical strength, and onslaughts of divine power?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of these could shake Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood tall and unyielding, like a sharpened blade against the winds of the storm surging around him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Osborne realized this was merely a challenge for an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his current cultivation level being Ascension Four, his actual combat capabilities far surpassed that level.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To others at Ascension Four, this trial might have felt overwhelming or even life-threatening.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, it was as refreshing as standing by the sea, feeling the gentle breeze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his current strength, barring any unexpected events or interference from the Ascension Stairway, passing the trial for Ascension Four would be a breeze. In fact, he felt confident he could also breeze through the challenges for an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the trials required for Ascension Ten, with a bit more effort, he could likely manage those too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, counting on the Ascension Stairway to play fair was wishful thinking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne successfully navigated through the standard trials, the unexpected arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascension Stairway shook violently before a Chrono-Spatial Gateway erupted at its pinnacle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze sharply focused on the disturbance, his expression turning cold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne was greeted by a sight that made his blood run cold. From the Chrono-Spatial Gateway, the gargantuan head of a white tiger materialized, its fierce eyes glaring with a prehistoric ferocity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, slowly and menacingly, its massive body emerged into the world.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the colossal white tiger planted its paws firmly on the empty expanse of the void, it was as if the very fabric of space trembled under its might.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each step resounded like thunderous drumbeats, a deafening rhythm that echoed through the air and sent shockwaves rippling outward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, an overwhelming and almost suffocating pressure bore down on Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anomaly, we meet again!" The tiger's voice rumbled, deep and menacing.</span></p></div>
