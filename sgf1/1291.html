        <h1>Chapter 1290 Reckoning</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Hearin City, within the Deschanel family's stronghold, an air of unease permeated the halls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if a storm front loomed overhead, weighing heavily on everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had recently received shocking, unsettling news: the three Transcendent Deities and seventeen Superior Deities dispatched to handle the Augustine family had not returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumors swirled that something had happened to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revelation left the entire Deschanel family stupefied, though no one dared to voice their concerns openly. They clung to the hope that it was all a false report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, who on the Blue Planet could possibly slay three Transcendent Deities and seventeen Superior Deities?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The core members of the Deschanel family had never taken the Augustine family seriously despite its claim as </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> premier Ancient Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With so many of their ancestors having been revived, they regarded the Augustine family as insignificant, absurd </span><span>even,</span><span> to imagine they could take down such formidable figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone finally blurted out, "It must be a false rumor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could the Augustine family possibly wipe out our three Transcendent Deity ancestors? Even if our ancestors stood still and invited them, they couldn't be killed by the likes of the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another chimed in, "Exactly, it must be fake news!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you told me the Pantheon League had managed it, I might believe it. During the </span><span>Age of Gods, they rivaled, perhaps even surpassed, the power of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the Augustine family, anyway? A superpower only a few hundred years in the making! We could crush them effortlessly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Deschanel family members consoled each other, they gradually became more composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, a sudden change washed over their faces, drawing their gazes skyward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above them hovered a mass of figures, having appeared without warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne, flanked by the deities of the Augustine family and the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members remained hidden, of course, held in reserve as Osborne's trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow also remained out of sight, not due to Osborne's orders, but because she chose not to reveal herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nonetheless, Osborne knew she was nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For this counterattack on the Deschanel Clan, Osborne had assembled his entire might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes locked coldly on the family below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, the reckoning begins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a whisper, Osborne raised his voice, saying, "Hear me, Deschanel! Your arrogance in challenging the Augustine family will cost you dearly. Our vengeance is at hand, and all of you will pay with your lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, Osborne motioned with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A formidable force erupted, dark power swirling through the Deschanel family compound and quickly forming a colossal vortex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This vortex teemed with consuming energy, its gravitational pull drawing desperate, panicked cries from the Deschanel family members as they struggled futilely to escape its clutches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those who had achieved divinity found themselves ensnared, inexorably drawn into Osborne's Abyssal Spiral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of moments, the Deschanel family's residence was reduced to rubble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing Osborne's devastating display, Sebastian, Bryce, and others stood in awe, their shock palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A furious roar rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A towering figure emerged from within the Deschanel Clan, rushing to intercept and shatter Osborne's Abyssal Spiral, hoping to rescue his kin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne eyed the newcomer and let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another Transcendent Deity? I'll handle this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could act, the God of Star stepped in. She flashed forward, placing herself between the Deschanel Clan's Transcendent Deity and those in need, effectively cutting off his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying surge of energy continued to erupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Abyssal Spiral continued its destructive work, swiftly obliterating the remnants of the Deschanel Clan. Thousands were consumed by the swirling </span><span>maelstrom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew the fight was far from over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The true powerhouses of the Deschanel Clan were surely concealed in their hidden underwater sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated Satan's Eye, his vision piercing through the ocean depths and soil to reveal the sanctuary's interior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, over ten thousand Deschanel members huddled together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel was at the forefront, her eyes bloodshot and devoid of the arrogance she exhibited just three days prior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bowed deeply at the foot of the Sanctuary Casket, her forehead pressed against the ground in humility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind her, fifteen Superior Deities of the Deschanel Clan were assembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We beseech you, elders and clan leader, to awaken! Due to my failures, we have lost three Transcendent Deity elders. Now, the Augustine family is upon us, and we are defenseless. Please awaken, or we shall meet our doom!" Rachel pleaded, her voice quavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The masses behind her echoed her desperate cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We implore the elders and the clan leader to return! We implore the elders and the clan leader to return!"</span></p></div>
