        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twelve Superior Deities of the Deschanel Clan, who had previously surrounded the Augustine Estate from a distance, now sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been content to watch the spectacle unfold, believing that with Eamon and two other Transcendent Deities on their side, the Augustine family stood no chance. Their role was merely to ensure that no one escaped this grim fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the tables had turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had anticipated that the Augustine family, whom they had always regarded with disdain, would produce two powerful Transcendent Deities capable of not only holding their ground against Eamon and his allies but even gaining the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, they could no longer afford to stand idly by. With Eamon's furious command echoing in their ears, the twelve Superior Deities launched their assault on Sebastian and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic washed over Sebastian and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had barely survived their previous encounter with five Superior Deities; if it hadn't been for God of Star's intervention, they would have perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they faced twelve Superior Deities&mdash;a force far beyond their capacity to withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror and despair gripped their hearts once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Divine Shadow and God of Star fought valiantly, their opponents suddenly unleashed a furious onslaught. The two powerful beings were forced to contend with relentless attacks, leaving no room for them to assist Sebastian and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay strong!" Sebastian shouted, rallying his comrades as they huddled together, desperately trying to form a defensive line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was no use. The overwhelming force of the twelve Deschanel Clan Superior Deities crashed down upon them like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined might shattered the Augustine family's defenses, and within moments, several weaker members of the Augustine family were obliterated, their Divine Bodies exploding in a shower of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pale-faced and trembling, the remaining fighters felt the bitter taste of defeat as blood trickled from their lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't hold them off&mdash;there was no way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twelve Superior Deities were like twelve heavy-duty trucks barreling down a narrow road, while the Augustine family members were merely a hundred bicycles standing in their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could a hundred bicycles possibly withstand the onslaught of twelve massive trucks?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force of the attack crushed them, leaving them shattered and broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, despair washed over everyone, including Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, anguish clawing at his heart, "Is this it? Are we really going to fall?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with God of Star and Divine Shadow fighting alongside us, we can't hold back the Deschanel Clan? Is today the day the Augustine family is wiped out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood dripped from the corner of Sebastian's mouth as hopelessness filled his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could possibly come to their rescue now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like there was no one left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair settled like a heavy fog over every member of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, deep within the Augustine Bastion, in Osborne's training chamber, a terrifying power erupted from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More accurately, it surged forth from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity residing within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy radiated with such intensity that it enveloped the entire training room, creating an impenetrable barrier. No one could approach; it was as if Osborne were encased in a protective cocoon, shielding him from any disturbances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was engaged in an incredibly crucial task&mdash;completing the third step of his fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This step was fraught with danger, but only for others. The fusion process would unleash a massive amount of energy, creating vibrations so intense that ordinary beings would be unable to withstand them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after breaking through to the Intermediate Deity realm, Osborne found his Divine Body significantly strengthened, granting him the ability to withstand the tremendous vibrations generated by the fusion process. More importantly, he possessed the Breath of Celestial, which allowed him to exert a degree of control over the energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this state, the third step of his fusion with the Lotus progressed remarkably smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he had achieved success over half a day ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't emerge from his training just yet; there was still a crucial task that required his attention. Following the completion of the third fusion step, he had to allow the roots of the Lotus to penetrate the bodies of the Blood Demon members. This step would grant them the same protection he enjoyed, a degree of immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the roots of the Lotus were anchored within them, any injuries they sustained would initiate a healing process fueled by its energy. Even if their physical forms were utterly obliterated, they could rely on the Lotus to regenerate their Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This transformation would render the Blood Demon members into an immortal army!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer would they fear injuries or death; their combat effectiveness would skyrocket, outstripping the limits they had known before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this entire process required the cooperation of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why, at such a critical moment for the Augustine family, they hadn't yet taken action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, the Blood Demon members were seated in the grand training chamber, legs crossed and minds open. They surrendered themselves to the ethereal roots of the </span><span>Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, allowing those roots to flow in from the void and take root in every corner of their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once this process was complete, they would gain a measure of immortality, and Osborne would equally reap tremendous benefits from their union.</span></p></div>
