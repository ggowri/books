        <h1>Chapter 2314 The Final Day Dawned-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after taking inventory, Osborne discovered he was sitting on a mind-boggling 165 tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a staggering 16.5 million points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he registered them all under his name, Osborne would instantly rocket to the top of the leaderboard, leaving Agatha in the dust!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd be sitting on double her score! Given the circumstances, this championship was practically in the bag for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, according to the rule book, even if someone managed to take him down, they could only plunder one-tenth of his points, and each person could only plunder him once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson took him down, he'd still walk away with the championship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could that actually happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hell no!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't about to let Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson beat him in a conga line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Osborne had a trick up his sleeve&mdash;he could just hold off on registering those tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could bide his time until the state duel was almost over, then whip out the tokens, register them all at once, and skyrocket to the top of the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, it would be too late for anyone to try and plunder his points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, Osborne could lock in that first-place finish, with no sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't about to go that route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he won like that, a bunch of people would cry foul, maybe even accuse him of cheating. They might even strip him of his victory and bar him from the zone duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That wouldn't be worth it in the slightest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Right now, I can use the Sublime Concealment Orb to mask the energy signature of the tokens! Keep anyone from sniffing out that I'm carrying around a mountain of points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But I can't keep that up forever; someone's bound to call me out on it! So, once I find Clara, I need to register these tokens, pronto!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne decided to track down Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Clara was his teammate, Osborne had promised to help her break into the top ten and take her to the zone duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no intention of going back on that promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">To get Clara into the top ten, I need to gift her at least four million points! To play it safe, I should probably bump that up to five million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That would still leave me with over ten million points, more than enough to comfortably coast to first place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that plan locked in, Osborne tried to get in touch with Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called her communication terminal, but it just rang and rang without an answer, causing him to frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There's only one explanation! Clara must be in the thick of a fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking along those lines, Osborne started moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm was vast, but with Satan's Eye in his arsenal, finding someone wasn't too difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he spotted Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Osborne got a good look at the situation, his face clouded over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was in a fight, just as he'd suspected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she wasn't alone. Leroy was fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Clara and Leroy, teamed up? When did that happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their opponents were even more surprising. It was Leroy's former teammates, the squad of elite disciples from the Eight Great Academies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remembered that their captain was named Jared, ranked 28th on the strength leaderboard. While his individual combat prowess wasn't exactly top-tier, his squad was a force to be reckoned with, and Jared himself was holding down the tenth spot on the point leaderboard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Jared's squad is ganging up on Clara and Leroy? What in the world is going on here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided to hold his horses and hung back in the shadows, carefully observing the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed that both Clara and Leroy had grown significantly stronger since the city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared and his seven teammates were struggling to break through their defenses, which clearly infuriated Jared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat out the words in a chilling voice. "Leroy, you still want to resist? You're a disciple of the Azure Haven Academy! I strongly advise you to throw in the towel now! Hand over your points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You both have around 800 thousand points. If you surrender, you'll give me an extra 1.6 million points, all but guaranteeing my place in the top ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That way, the Eight Great Academies will secure a spot in the top ten! But if your stubborn resistance causes the Eight Great Academies to miss out on that top ten spot, you'll be branded a traitor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'm ordering you right now&mdash;surrender immediately!"</span></p></div>
