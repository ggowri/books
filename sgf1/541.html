        <h1>Chapter 541 Defeated Opponent</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John's mocking was so loud that the few surrounding participants from the branch bloodlines who had already arrived couldn't help but look over at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was teasing and taunting in all their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John sneered and let out a deep sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Four days ago, John used his right of challenge to fight Osborne at Challenge Peak, but he was accidentally defeated by Osborne because he was too confident and careless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This event had been unexpectedly spread out, and he felt humiliated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had been holding back his anger for the past few days, and now he had finally found the chance to taunt Osborne and vent his anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, why don't you say something?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you also ashamed of yourself? A lot of other people from branch bloodlines qualified for the Branch Bloodline Competition, but you're the only one alone in Dampston.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you so embarrassed that you want to hide?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John didn't want to let go of Osborne, so he continued to taunt Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry also moved closer to Osborne and sneered, "There is only one person under the age of forty-five in a branch bloodline who has reached Class A. It's just ridiculous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I were you, I would just quit participating in the Branch Bloodline Competition. Anyway, you're doomed to come in last place. Why don't you just hide at home instead of coming out and embarrassing yourself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John laughed out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Henry, stop it. Can't you see that he's afraid to talk? If you keep talking, he might actually have to quit the Branch Bloodline Competition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, whether he quits or not, he's going to come in last."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry looked at Osborne with contempt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at Osborne and said indifferently, "Osborne, you'd better pray that you won't fight against me during the competition. Otherwise, I will make you pay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, why don't you say something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne wasn't tired of it. He eventually turned to the two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said calmly, "I just don't want to talk to defeated opponents!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry and John were instantly irritated by Osborne's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were indeed Osborne's defeated opponents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry gritted his teeth and said, "Osborne, don't be so arrogant. We just lost to you last time because we weren't familiar with you, and we were too careless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We had a lot more tactics last time, but we didn't use them. If we go toe-to-toe this time, you're going to lose badly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiles faintly, "Yeah? Go for it. Hang in there for a while longer and don't come in last or second to last again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not the same as last time and this time. We'll do better this time. You will come in last place this time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne still looked calm. "Is that so? I'll give you my blessing to definitely take a better place this time at the Branch Bloodline Competition, or at least not to come in last and second to last again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because the higher you are ranked, the more resources main bloodlines will give you, and ten percent of that will belong to the branch bloodlines in Dampston.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are just my defeated opponents."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, Osborne shrugged and stopped paying attention to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry and John instantly blushed and glared at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, Osborne ignored them, and there was nothing they could do about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All they could do was get angry inside. When the Branch Bloodline Competition started, they wanted to be the first to beat Osborne and make him come in last.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By now, five of the nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family had arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne glanced around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked over to the branch bloodline from Norlend. There were eighteen people in total participating in this Branch Bloodline Competition, and one of them, a man in his thirties, was surrounded by the others in the center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man was very tall and strong, standing at least six feet tall and covered in muscle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne knew that he was the heir from the branch bloodline in Norlend, Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney realized that Osborne was observing him, so he instantly glanced at Osborne fiercely, as intimidating as a wild animal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Osborne just smiled slightly, nodded at him and turned to look the other way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney was stunned. Then, he smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He rubbed his chin and murmured, "Interesting! Maybe Osborne's arrival will bring about some changes in the format and give me a chance to win."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Osborne looked around at the branch bloodline from Stayton.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were fifteen participants in the Branch Bloodline Competition in Stayton, and their heir was Tony, who was a young man of only twenty-seven or twenty-eight years of age. He was the youngest of the heirs present from the branch bloodlines besides Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was handsome and aloof, as if everyone owed him millions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing that Osborne was looking at him, he glared at Osborne with the same fierce eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne still smiled and nodded at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tony snorted coldly, and he didn't care for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne finally looked back to the team from the branch bloodline in Donovan. They sent thirteen participants, and the heir was Kent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kent looked gentle, and he seemed like a woman. He was in his thirties and about 5.6 feet tall, but he looked condescending and had sharp eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Kent felt Osborne looking at him, he didn't even move his gaze and just ignored Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled and didn't care.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Other than the top three from Yalynch, Marcelin, and Ransford, the rest of the participants from the branch bloodlines are already here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They'll be here soon, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne was thinking, he suddenly felt a huge energy suddenly surging over like a dark cloud from the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone in the presence felt breathless at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They all looked in one direction.</p></div>
