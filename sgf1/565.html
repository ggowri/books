        <h1>Chapter 565 Siege</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne couldn't help but frown at Rodney's threat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Rodney and Sam were to join forces, Osborne would indeed be in grave danger. Alone, Osborne could only suppress Sam, but inflicting serious harm was a challenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's defenses were simply too formidable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Point Blank Force could breach Sam's defenses, yet the damage it inflicted was insufficient. It was akin to poking a turtle with a needle; while it would cause pain, it would exhaust Osborne before he could even think of killing the turtle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Rodney's strength paled in comparison to Sam's, it was not by much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Together, the duo would pose a nearly insurmountable challenge to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne spoke calmly, "You wish to ally with Sam? Would you commit such folly? Even if you join forces to seize the emblem, Sam commands more forces than you. Ultimately, he would emerge victorious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney sneered, "That is none of your concern! I will first deal with you and then determine the victor with Sam. The outcome will hinge on our abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In any case, there is no way you can retain the Heir's Emblem! You possess spatial power. If that is your means of escape, we may not be able to encircle you next time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I believe Sam comprehends this as well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney glanced at Sam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam nodded coldly and replied, "I agree to the alliance! First, we shall seize his emblem. After eliminating him, we will engage in a fair duel. The victor shall become the quasi-heir!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney grinned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sneered and fixed his gaze on Osborne, "Osborne, you have one last chance. Hand over the Heir's Emblem to me, and I shall grant you the Forbidden Space Disk! Otherwise, you will leave with nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne maintained a composed expression and replied coolly, "Nice try!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I indeed desire the Forbidden Space Disk, but I will obtain it myself! You covet the Heir's Emblem? Then come and take it if you possess the skill!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Reckless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney was utterly enraged. "If that is your stance, then so be it! I wish to witness how you intend to resist the combined assault of Sam and myself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he handed the Forbidden Space Disk to an aide behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Continue to infuse power into it to maintain the frozen state of the surrounding space!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Be vigilant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having issued his commands, Rodney twisted his neck and strode towards Osborne with a sneer playing on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A similar sneer appeared on Sam's face as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The energy within his body surged wildly, shaking off the blood-red hair that ensnared him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, your end has come!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, the duo exchanged glances and launched their assault simultaneously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's massive fist hurtled toward Osborne with brutal force. Concurrently, Rodney activated Satan's Eye, employing mind control to suppress Osborne while projecting illusions into his mind to disrupt him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne took a deep breath, and the martial art aura burst forth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He disregarded Rodney's mind control entirely. With his current physical prowess, even if Rodney's mind control were several times stronger, it would fail to affect him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Illusion Projection from Rodney was utterly ineffectual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In recent times, Osborne had absorbed the star power, significantly enhancing his body and soul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The strength of soul power was directly linked to mental power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's mental power far surpassed Rodney's, rendering his illusion projection inconsequential.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney's actions, however, reminded Osborne of an opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My mental power should now exceed that of both of them. A mental attack might have a substantial impact on them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this thought, Osborne acted immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He first blocked Sam's assault with a punch, sending Sam reeling backward, then promptly activated Satan's Eye to project an illusion towards Sam's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next instant, a flicker of confusion crossed Sam's eyes, but he swiftly recovered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned and murmured inwardly, "Sam's mental defenses are so robust? The effect was too brief, and his defenses are impenetrable. It's challenging to injure him seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I shall test Rodney's mental defenses next!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that decision, Osborne immediately projected an illusion into Rodney's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Buzz!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next second, a burst of light erupted from Rodney's body, shielding his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't anticipate your mental power to be so formidable, even surpassing mine. What a pity! It's futile! For this heir competition, I made ample preparations. How could I not bring along the ancient magic weapon capable of defending against mental attacks?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Rodney finished speaking, Osborne felt a wave of helplessness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Indeed, his plan didn't work!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sam's mental defenses were robust, and his physical defenses were even more so. He was akin to an impenetrable turtle, resistant to any blows. Rodney, even more egregiously, had prepared an ancient magic weapon for mental defense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed he had other ancient magic weapons on him as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was becoming quite challenging!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Should I reveal more of my cards?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was torn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In truth, he didn't have many cards left to play.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His first trump card was the Breath of Celestial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During this period, Osborne had not ceased practicing the Breath of Celestial, having already reached the third level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The third level of the Breath of Celestial could enhance his strength by 40%, which was a significant boost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was confident that. After mastering the Breath of Celestial, he could overpower Sam in terms of strength. No matter how formidable his defenses, Sam would not withstand the assault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The second trump card was the intermediate application of Thunder Power: Thunder Explosion!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was Osborne's most potent trump card at present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having witnessed Owen perform the Thunder Explosion firsthand, Osborne quickly grasped the underlying principle. After a period of practice, he had initially mastered it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had personally experienced the might of a Thunder Explosion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he were to employ the Thunder Explosion, he was confident he could seriously injure either Sam or Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Should I resort to the Thunder Explosion?"</p></div>
