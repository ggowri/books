        <h1>Chapter 299 Farewell</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Osborne gently pressed a kiss on Austin's forehead, stirring her from sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin blinked awake, her eyelids heavy with exhaustion, but as the realization hit her that Osborne was about to leave, she sprang up, wrapping her arms tightly around his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin inhaled deeply, as if trying to memorize his scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin, you really should get some more rest. I'm just heading to Dampston, not disappearing forever," Osborne reassured her, patting her back soothingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Austin bit her lip, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "Osborne, I'm going to miss you! I'll find a way to visit you in Dampston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I'd like that!" Osborne replied with a warm smile but then suddenly smacked his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Almost forgot. I have something for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached into his Dimensional Space and pulled out a beautifully crafted wooden box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Austin saw the Divine Favor Crown nestled inside, she froze, her hand flying to her mouth as tears streamed down her cheeks uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories flooded back to her - of that day at Wesley and Ophelia's wedding, when Osborne had placed the Crown of Fate on Clarissa's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had watched from the crowd, envy twisting her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, here was Osborne, gifting her a crown that was just as magnificent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's its name?" Austin asked, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied with a grin, "It's called Divine Favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Favor Crown! I may not be by your side, but I hope the divine will look after you, keeping you safe and healthy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Favor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears flowed more freely from Austin's eyes as she clung to him, unwilling to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, she finally wiped her tears away. "Osborne, you have to put it on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne carefully placed the Divine Favor Crown on her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crown settled, Austin transformed into a radiant vision sparkling with beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but stare, mesmerized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a blush creeping across her cheeks, Austin looked at him and said, "Osborne, could you delay your departure by just an hour? I... I want to have one more time with you. I want to wear the Divine Favor Crown while we're doing it. Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked at her flushed face, his heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No man can refuse such a request!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he lunged at her once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Austin, adorned with the Divine Favor Crown, finally succumbed to sleep, utterly exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was still buzzing with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since absorbing the unique power of the blood diamond, his physical stamina had become almost superhuman. He felt like he could run a marathon without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tucked Austin in, making sure she was comfortable, before stepping out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to hit the road!" he muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he left the villa and got into his car, he didn't head straight for Dampston's Pinchide City. Instead, he took a leisurely drive around Mayby City, soaking in the scenery outside his window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mayby City wasn't his hometown, but he had spent over seven years here - going to college, marrying Ophelia, and later, after the divorce, encountering both Clarissa and Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had made memories with Isa, Alison, Zoe, and even Evelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was so much history tied to this place, and he didn't know when he'd be back. </span><span>So</span><span> he wanted to savor every last moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in thought, Osborne found himself outside the Caldwell Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he realized where he was, he frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since he was already there, Osborne didn't dwell on it. He simply drove past the manor, ready to exit the city and head to Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, an unexpected turn of events occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous roar filled the air as several helicopters appeared overhead, flying low before swiftly descending onto the open ground in front of the Caldwell Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the helicopters, a group of people quickly disembarked and ran towards the road, stopping Osborne's car in its tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face hardened, with his senses on high alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Who could this be? Six helicopters? Only an ancient family would have the resources for such an operation. Who's trying to take me down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the car door and stepped </span><span>out,</span><span> his gaze fixed on the emblem on the helicopters - a howling gray wolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't recognize it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From what he knew, none of Skyefall's ancient families bore such a crest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion drew the attention of the Caldwell family members nearby. Several of them came out, curious about the disturbance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ophelia and Evelyn appeared, their expressions shifting to surprise when they saw Osborne surrounded in the middle of the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring them, Osborne focused intently on the man descending from the helicopters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, in his mid-forties to early fifties, exuded an air of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was stern, marking him as someone used to wielding power, though his eyes betrayed a sense of exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the man locked eyes with Osborne, a spark of recognition and excitement flashed across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand, and immediately, dozens of burly men rushed to Osborne's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man commanded, "Greet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The burly men immediately saluted to Osborne and, in unison, shouted, "We greet Mr. Augustine!"</span></p></div>
