        <h1>Chapter 1677 Scheming</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne</span><span> thought, </span><span>"Let's not worry about that right now! If Angelo can </span><span>kill </span><span>Deathborn King of this Deathborn Kingdom, then everything will be </span><span>fine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, once Deathborn King is defeated, I'll get the death scent liquid needed to fully restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. At that point, I'd </span><span>be a real immortal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that kind of power, I won't have to worry even if I'm surrounded by several Deathborn Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne instructed his clones to keep a close watch on Deathborn Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of his other clones had successfully led the patrol of Deathborn to a spot just a short distance from Angelo and his group. In a flash, the clone vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The patrol looked around with confusion</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then they started searching and </span><span>ca</span><span>ught </span><span>sight of the trail Angelo and the others had left behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged knowing glances and quietly began to follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like it worked!" Osborne said with a triumphant grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn patrol had picked up on Angelo's group's trail, and as long as they followed it, they were bound to find them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Angelo ignored them, they would inevitably cross paths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Angelo </span><span>killed</span><span> them, Deathborn King would sense </span><span>it</span><span> and quickly mobilize his forces to surround Angelo and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either way, there would be trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne</span><span> thought, </span><span>"</span><span>I </span><span>hope Deathborn King isn't too powerful. If Angelo can't take him down, things could get </span><span>tricky</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glimmer of determination flickered in Osborne's eyes as he pondered the impending conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Angelo and his team continued to move cautiously. Angelo was being exceptionally careful, and they hadn't yet encountered Deathborn patrol, though no one relaxed their guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Angelo suddenly perked up, and his expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whipped his head around, a sharp light flashing in his eyes as he peered back in the direction they had come from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face paled, tightening with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Crap</span><span>! There's a patrol of Deathborn following </span><span>us</span><span>! They're just two miles behind us and will discover us soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's worse, they're all Deity Overlords! This is definitely a Deathborn Kingdom patrol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're in big trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's grim warning drained the color from everyone's faces. </span><span>They panicked</span><span>, and fear showed in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can we do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Lord </span><span>Angelo, </span><span>please think of a solution</span><span>!" Edison exclaimed, and his composure slipped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was a general at the </span><span>peak</span><span> of the Deity Overlord </span><span>realm </span><span>of the Wild Flame Army, facing the terrifying Deathborn Kingdom was another story entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison's anxiety was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Angelo being there, he almost would have </span><span>run away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their worst fear came true.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>nd they </span><span>didn't know</span><span> this whole situation could have been avoided if Osborne hadn't intentionally lured the patrol to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, they would</span><span> hate Osborne deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo</span><span> shouted</span><span>, "Why panic?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deathborn patrol hasn't spotted us yet. They're only following the trail we left behind. As long as we can outpace them, they won't catch us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he waved his hand decisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's keep moving! We need to </span><span>speed up</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, the team quickened their steps, urgency driving them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, Angelo chose not to </span><span>fight with </span><span>Deathborn patrol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched the scene unfold, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe Angelo came up with such a clever plan! I have to admit, it's a solid approach. But... it would be even better if they weren't heading straight </span><span>towards</span><span> the Deathborn Kingdom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face reflected his intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Angelo and his group were unwittingly heading straight toward</span><span>s</span><span> Deathborn Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given their current pace, they would crash into the kingdom in just twenty minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is suicide! Pure madness! I can't let this happen!" Osborne thought, a grave concern etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deathborn Kingdom housed at least a million Deathborns, with the army alone numbering over 100 thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Angelo and his </span><span>teammates</span><span>, charging straight into the heart of the Deathborn Kingdom would </span><span>only kill themselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't care about them! But it's obvious that </span><span>Angelo</span><span> can't defeat the </span><span>Deathborn King </span><span>in the </span><span>Deathborn Kingdom</span><span>!</span><span>" He </span><span>thought and frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to </span><span>prevent Angelo and the others from stumbling into the Deathborn Kingdom</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne needed Angelo to </span><span>kill the</span><span> Deathborn King, yet the battlefield had to be as far from the kingdom as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did he see a </span><span>success rate</span><span> for Angelo's victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination fueling him, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>disguised</span><span> one of his clones</span><span> as</span><span> a Deathborn and </span><span>stopped </span><span>Angelo</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Angelo spotted the disguised clone, his expression hardened dramatically. He hesitated, instinctively wary of a confrontation, and swiftly redirected his group away from </span><span>the </span><span>Deathborn Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite their best efforts to escape, it didn't take long for the nearby Deathborn patrol to </span><span>find them.</span></p></div>
