        <h1>Chapter 2209 Get Those Memories-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tragedy struck hard when Clarissa, Emma, and Austin were forced into the cycle of reincarnation. The heart-wrenching loss left him devastated, with only Anita remaining by his side as a constant reminder of what he had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the encounter with Isa, and Osborne took her as his disciple, seeing in her the potential to carry on his teachings and values.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, as a sense of foreboding grew with the impending breakthrough of Lord Malevolence, he made a fateful decision. He would tap into the power of the Orb of Reincarnation, not only to find Clarissa, Emma, and the others in the cycle of reincarnation but also to finally resolve the lingering injuries that had plagued him for so long. As each memory washed over his consciousness, weaving together the intricate tapestry of his past, Osborne felt an unshakable connection to the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, it was as if he </span><span>were</span><span> living through an entire lifetime all over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The events of his past life unfurled before his inner eye, sharp and detailed, and they </span><span>melded seamlessly with his very core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in the corners of his eyes and trickled down his cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, a wave of realization crashing over him, "So, this is who I truly am.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is how I spent my previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not from </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet at all..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the memories of his past life became one with his being, Osborne grasped a multitude of truths, which firmly cemented his identity. He came to understand that he was the God of Night, and the God of Night was none other than himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fears that he might turn into someone else never materialized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The merging of the memories didn't give rise to another consciousness within him; instead, it simply bestowed upon him a clearer and more profound understanding of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, he was also the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ultimately, there was no denying that he was Osborne through and through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The experiences of his past life were precisely that&mdash;things of the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, he was Osborne, and those memories wouldn't alter his true self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only change he sensed was an abrupt weight of responsibility settling on his shoulders, the burden of unfinished business from his past life now bearing down upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, he discovered the truth about his identity in that bygone life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His name had once been Osborne Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't used that name since setting foot on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet, but it was still rightfully his. He originated from the Racial Convergence Planet, a prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the mightiest empire in that world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among a royal lineage brimming with princes, he was just one of the many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had shown remarkable talent from a young age&mdash;not the most powerful of them all, but surely among the elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne's mother's low status as a palace maid meant he was frequently harassed and shamed within the royal family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other princes and princesses regarded his existence as a blemish on the noble bloodline of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, convinced that his mother's position had sullied their heritage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, he found himself constantly in the crosshairs of others, facing hostility and opposition wherever he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became more and more reclusive, throwing himself whole-heartedly into cultivation. He was driven by the conviction that only by growing stronger could he attain a higher status and win his father's respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that if he climbed high enough on the social ladder, his mother's status would also be elevated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne trained with unwavering determination, surpassing everyone else in terms of effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arduous labor finally paid off. In a royal sparring competition, he defeated his peers and started to stand out in the royal family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, rather than bringing a turn for the better in Osborne's life, this victory signaled the start of an even bleaker period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other princes and princesses saw him as a menace. The bullying intensified and evolved into devious plots against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he reached the pinnacle as an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King, the hostility reached its peak, leading to a savage assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That fateful night, pandemonium broke out in the palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ambushed and severely injured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a cruel irony, all the evidence pointed to his mother as the mastermind behind the turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew it was a set-up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she was executed, innocent but wrongly condemned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how desperately Osborne pleaded, his heartless father showed no leniency. Right before Osborne's eyes, he ordered his mother's death without a shred of remorse. And he himself was banished from the palace and exiled from the Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart turned to stone towards his father when the latter cut off all connections with him. The king issued a decree, strictly forbidding Osborne from ever setting foot back in the Glorious Divine Kingdom or even staying on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defying this edict would mean certain death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, under the scornful looks of countless onlookers, he embarked on a journey through the vast starry expanse. Driven by a seething hatred and overwhelming sorrow, Osborne made his way to the lush and green world called </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet.</span></p></div>
