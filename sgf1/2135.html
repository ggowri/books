        <h1>Chapter 2125 Radiant Golden Ore-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda approached Osborne, her gaze drawn to the Bloodwrought Bow gripped tightly in his hands, its eerie crimson glow captivating her. A sense of admiration mixed with envy washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel an undeniable threat radiating from the bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, although she had been defeated by Osborne, he had only managed to breach her Luminous Elven Wings' defenses when wielding the Dimensional Maw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, Alfreda sensed a palpable danger emanating from a mere divine artifact placed in Osborne's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of boost are we talking about?" Alfreda couldn't help but ask, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a subtle smile, Osborne replied, "Almost ten times as powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Alfreda's jaw dropped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty-eight pieces of Azure Ore had amplified the Bloodwrought Bow's power by tenfold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her envy flared, and a hint of frustration crept into her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out her Arcane Staff of Nature, clenched her jaw, and said, "No way! I want Azure Ore too! My staff is an Apex divine artifact&mdash;its previous power was definitely greater than your Bloodwrought Bow. But now? I feel like your bow has surpassed </span><span>it</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got to make my staff stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Perfect timing! I could use more Azure Ore myself. Let's head into the Corrosive Marsh and hunt for some Mud Golems to snag what we need!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he waved his hand, summoning a swarm of Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hundred fifty-six clones appeared around him, standing ready for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spread out and search for Mud Golems! Bring back Azure Ore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, two hundred and fifty-six Spatial Clones dispersed and headed in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda watched in awe, struck dumb by the spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Clones? You have so many! Are you really sending them to fight Mud Golems? Can they handle it? Can they really collect Azure Ore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded confidently. "They should be alright.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Spatial Clones have around sixty to seventy percent of my attacking power, but their defenses aren't as strong. Mud Golems are slow, so they won't be much of a threat.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They can definitely take down the Mud Golems and fetch us Azure Ore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, looking at Alfreda, Osborne added with a grin, "Since you're my little sidekick, I won't shortchange you! Whatever Azure Ore my clones gather, I'll give you ten percent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to him, an impish glint in her gaze as she hooked her arm around his. "Ten percent? Come on, that's hardly fair! How about we split it fifty-fifty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot her an amused glare. "You want to split it equally when you're not lifting a finger? Not happening! Ten percent is already generous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not bothering to acknowledge Alfreda's playful pestering, Osborne reached into his Dimensional Bag and handed it over to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "My Spatial Clones also found some Element Gold Crystals in the Death Chasm! Given your situation, I'll toss you ten percent of those too.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next, I'm going to study that pale golden crystal. You go off and practice on your own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne ignored Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you're being stingy! Just ten percent for your little sidekick? That's not how a boss rolls!" Alfreda said as she accepted the Dimensional Bag, her lips forming a playful pout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alfreda opened the bag, her expression quickly shifted from bemused to astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes nearly popped out of her head as she gazed at the sheer volume of Element Gold Crystals packed inside the bag&mdash;all organized and shimmering brilliantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three hundred Element Gold Crystals?! And they're all the plant elemental kind I need?"</span></p></div>
