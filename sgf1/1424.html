        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Peak Nine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself as he searched for information on Divine Peak Nine through his computer but found little more than a whisper of data&mdash;almost nothing at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suspected this was due to Lachlan's insufficient clearance level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that the entire East Zone of Celestara was divided into ten smaller regions, each defined by its own divine peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first divine peak marked East Zone One, while the second was in East Zone Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wild Flame City lay near Divine Peak Nine, placing it in East Zone Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The significance of these divine peaks was palpable, possibly even more critical than the ongoing efforts to eradicate human resistance in the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past few weeks, the Wild Flame Army had launched three assaults against the rebel forces in the West Zone, yet they consistently dispatched elite members to Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The exact nature of their missions remained a mystery, completely absent from the terminal's records.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Peak Nine, huh? If the secrecy is this tight, there's definitely something fishy going on. Too bad the old Lachlan wasn't one of the Wild Flame Army's top-tier operatives; he never had the chance to be part of any missions to Divine Peak Nine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne resolved to uncover the truth behind Divine Peak Nine someday. Those who had awakened their earth elemental power might have been sent there. "Are they mining, perhaps?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The possibilities swirled in his mind, but he decided to set them aside for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had just infiltrated the Wild Flame Army, and his immediate priority was to establish a solid foothold before contemplating anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he knew it, the night slipped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Osborne's Malevolence Amulet vibrated, revealing a set of coordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a summons from Jeffrey, delivered through the amulet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did the Malevolence Amulet serve as a protective divine artifact, but it was also a communication device capable of functioning over thousands of miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne sprang into action, quickly gathering his team&mdash;Albert, Laird, Jaxton, Darnell, and Arlen&mdash;and made his way to the designated meeting point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived, Jeffrey was already waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was the first squad leader to arrive. After a few minutes, the other nine squad leaders, each accompanied by their teams, trickled in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's move out!" Jeffrey commanded, not wasting any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out a device resembling a miniature spaceship and tossed it into the air. In an instant, it expanded into a massive steel airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a flying divine artifact&mdash;the Malevolence Airship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forged by the Artisan Institute, it could soar through the skies at incredible speeds, powered by Essence Crystals, far surpassing any aircraft from the Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only centurions and higher ranks had access to such an airship, and the more powerful the rank, the more formidable the airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it that the most advanced Malevolence Airships could cover distances of up to 6000 miles in the blink of an eye&mdash;so fast that the human eye could barely track them. Even top-tier Deity Overlord warriors would struggle to keep up; only a Deity King warrior might stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These airships weren't just fast; they could burrow underground, serve as nearly impenetrable fortresses, and even briefly enter parallel dimensions for interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a display of spatial power, a testament to their might!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gazed at the Malevolence Airship, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though this was merely a centurion-level airship with average defenses and speed, lacking the ability to burrow or engage in interdimensional travel, it was undeniably impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the shadow of the futuristic Malevolence Airship, even the sleekest supercars and private helicopters seemed like mere toys made for children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer power and design of this flying marvel was beyond anything Osborne had ever experienced. "The Artisan Institute of Lord Malevolence can truly forge a staggering array of divine artifacts. I need to find a way to get into the Artisan Institute one day!" he thought with a burst of ambition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All personnel, prepare to board the airship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey's command rang out, and with an effortless leap, he bounded onto the Malevolence Airship, disappearing into the main chamber within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the team remained on the deck, waiting for further instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the airship powered up, a shimmering layer of divine power enveloped it like a bubble, shielding the deck from the howling winds. To them, it felt eerily silent; the usual cacophony of air rushing past was nowhere to be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The velocity was incredible&mdash;akin to that of an ordinary Superior Deity making every effort to reach speeds of 60 thousand miles per hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, feeling a twinge of envy creeping in, "What an absolutely amazing piece of machinery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I get promoted to centurion, I'll have my own Malevolence Airship! I really don't think that day is too far off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his aspirations swirling in his mind, Osborne settled down, folding his legs as he adopted a meditation pose on the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The No. 9 mining area was a staggering 220 thousand miles away from Wild Flame City, and even with the Malevolence Airship's speed, they would need about three and a half hours to reach their destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to interact with the other squad members, he decided to close his eyes and pretend to meditate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His five teammates, who had been transformed into the Blood Clan by Osborne, mingled effortlessly with the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their transformation, their memories remained untouched, and they slipped seamlessly back into their old routines in the absence of Osborne's commands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one suspected a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this way, the journey to the No. 9 mining area passed swiftly.</span></p></div>
