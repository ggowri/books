        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After rummaging through the Demonic Dragon Clan member's memories, Osborne's emotions were in turmoil. Anger and relief were at war inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of his parents being sold into slavery by the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Paramount Supreme Clan made his blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was a glimmer of hope&mdash;they were still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still a shot at rescuing them, as long as he could figure out where they'd been sold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he realized the memories he'd accessed didn't give away the destination of the Human Community slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Isa, his voice calm but insistent. "Isa, do we know where my parents were sold?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded, but there was a hint of hesitation in her manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just spit it out!" Osborne pressed, his patience wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Isa spoke, "According to our investigation, the Paramount Supreme Clan had two buyers for the Human Community slaves. One is the Phantom Tide Demon Sect from </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet, and the other is an intermediary organization&mdash;the Mystic Sirius Sect from the Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phantom Tide Demon Sect? Mystic Sirius Sect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded. "The slave trade operations of the Paramount Supreme Clan are a bit chaotic. We've captured many of their people, but no one can definitively say whether your parents were sold to the Phantom Tide Demon Sect or the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we can be sure it was one of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's the Phantom Tide Demon Sect, that's somewhat manageable. They're the most powerful force on </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet, but their leader is only a Supernal Deity King&mdash;not quite at the Empyrean Sacredness level. Even if he's stronger than Lord Malevolence, it's not by much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, if your parents were sold to the Mystic Sirius Sect, we'd be in serious trouble! The Mystic Sirius Sect is far more powerful than the Phantom Tide Demon Sect, with plenty of Empyrean Sacredness warriors. They're not something we can handle right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most importantly, the Mystic Sirius Sect is just an intermediary. They acquire Human Community slaves from </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet not for themselves but to sell to other factions for profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, even if your parents were sold to the Mystic Sirius Sect, they likely aren't there anymore. They've probably been sold to someone else already..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isa finished, Osborne's face grew even graver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was becoming increasingly complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he reminded himself that having some information was better than none. No matter where his parents were, he could follow the leads and keep searching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just hoped they were alive because as long as they were, there was hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With steely determination, he declared, "Every single person involved in the Human </span><span>Community slave trade from the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Demonic Dragon Clan&mdash;kill them all! Leave no one standing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added urgently, "And make sure everyone is ready! Once I break through to Ascension Seven, we'll leave </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet immediately! I originally planned to use the Cosmic Translocator on </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet to head to the Racial Convergence Planet, but now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like we'll need to stay on </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet for a while to investigate the Phantom Tide Demon Sect and find out more about my parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, determination flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded in agreement. "Got it! I'll make arrangements right away! We're all set to go at a moment's notice..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, feeling the full weight of the situation bearing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He no longer held back his cultivation level. Stepping out of Hope Haven, he left </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet and ventured into the boundless starry sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the vast expanse of the cosmos, his cultivation level soared from Ascension Six to Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had become an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous hum, a gigantic Ascension Stairway materialized before him once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne faced the trial of the Ascension Stairway anew and breezed through it with effortless grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, Atticus of the Sacred Tiger Clan didn't show up this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed he'd thrown in the towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking off the thought, Osborne quickly made his way back to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet as the Ascension Stairway faded into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was raring to go right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His target was crystal-clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet!</span></p></div>
