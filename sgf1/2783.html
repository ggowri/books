        <h1>Chapter 2638 The Final Level</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Osborne was quickly clearing the levels, Seraphina and the others were not idle either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they had finally passed the test of the seventeenth level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, seeing the team reduced to just over a dozen people, Seraphina was very worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since the test of the fifteenth level began, members of their team started getting eliminated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fifteenth level eliminated one person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sixteenth level eliminated seven people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the seventeenth level just eliminated a total of thirty-six people!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just on the seventeenth level, they lost thirty-six members.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The team of fifty-six now only has eleven left. Apart from six Royal Family members, only five others remain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, these five are extremely exhausted and covered in injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing such a situation, Seraphina felt the pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, we finally reached the eighteenth level! As long as we pass the trial of the eighteenth level, we can get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!" Seraphina said excitedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've already done great by reaching the eighteenth level! After all, the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet were eliminated at the seventeenth level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am already stronger than the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina regained her confidence and said, "There's only one last trial left. I must pass it and get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina looked at Emiliano, Matthew, and the others beside her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, their breathing was also rapid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take a rest!" Seraphina said, "There's only one last trial left! It's only the fifth day, we still have time! The difficulty of the final trial will definitely be higher than before, and there might be a hundred projections of advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I no longer have expectations for others; I can only pin my hopes on the five of you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, you must do your best to protect me and buy me time! Even if all of you are eliminated, you must help me pass the trial!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina looked serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano and Matthew exchanged glances and both nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They said, "Don't worry. Before coming here, Father already instructed us to do our best to help you! We know what to do!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We will definitely help you with the trial on the eighteenth level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luckily, Father gave me a trump card, otherwise passing the trial on the eighteenth level might have been dangerous! But now it seems there shouldn't be much of a problem..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Seraphina closed her eyes and began to rest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She needed to adjust to her best state, preparing for the final trial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Success or failure hinges on this!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, outside the Celestial Spire, thirty-six figures appeared one after another. They were the ones eliminated on the seventeenth level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some of them looked confused, then gradually regained their composure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a powerful force enveloped them, swiftly lifting them and carrying them into the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here, Frederick and the others were staring at them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Were you eliminated on the seventeenth level?" Frederick asked. "What happened before you were eliminated? Tell me quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thirty-six people quickly explained the situation upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick breathed a sigh of relief and said, "So, Seraphina and the others have already passed the seventeenth level's test and entered the eighteenth level?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick smiled. "Almost there! They've already reached the eighteenth level! As long as they pass the eighteenth level's test, they can get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket and unlock it! Almost there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick could hardly contain his excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick, Princess Seraphina is truly a genius! It's been so long since such outstanding talents appeared on the Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet couldn't pass the seventeenth level of the Celestial Spire and were all eliminated, yet Princess Seraphina led everyone through the seventeenth level. Truly impressive!" At this moment, a warrior of the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick calmly said, "The two can't be compared! The Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet might have accidentally entered the Celestial Spire without any preparation. But I have been preparing for this day for a very, very long time..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone nodded upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thanks to Emperor Frederick's preparation, otherwise passing the eighteenth level of the Celestial Spire would have been nearly impossible for them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They clearly only allowed warriors below Empyrean Sacredness to enter, yet fifty advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors' projections appeared on the seventeenth level! It's practically impossible to pass..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fortunately, Emperor Frederick used a special method to help Princess Seraphina and the other six directly become mid Empyrean Sacredness while breaking through Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, they wouldn't have had any hope of passing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was praising Frederick. They were also eagerly anticipating Seraphina obtaining the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket and entering the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where are Osborne, Clara, and Leroy?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did you run into them?" someone asked at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who were eliminated all shook their heads.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them sneered, "They refused to follow Princess Seraphina's lead from the start and insisted on splitting into two teams with us! But there are only four of them; they probably can't even pass the fourteenth level's trial! Even if they somehow make it through, they'll definitely be eliminated on the fifteenth level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guess they'll be eliminated soon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, all the warriors frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne and his group are ungrateful and disregard the bigger picture! If the four of them were willing to follow Princess Seraphina's lead, perhaps her team would clear the levels faster, and so many people wouldn't have been eliminated!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When they come out, I must give them a good lesson!" said a warrior of the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly! They're too reckless. If because of them, Princess Seraphina fails to clear the eighteenth level and doesn't obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, I'll make sure to teach them a lesson!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At that time, even if you blame me, I won't let him off!" another warrior of the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana looked at the two speaking, hesitated for a moment, but said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her gaze became much colder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! Let's not talk about this anymore! Let's just wait for the result! If Seraphina can get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, then it's fine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's gaze was cold and mad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If she doesn't get it, I'll be very angry!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a loud explosion erupted on the twenty-sixth floor of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow shot out, shattering all the remaining projections of the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors. The surroundings instantly fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twenty-sixth floor cleared!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath. The fifty projections of Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors on the twenty-sixth floor had put considerable pressure on him. He had to use the Earth Arrow to take them down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Finally done!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next is the final twenty-seventh floor! As long as I clear the twenty-seventh floor, I can obtain the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Apocalypse Bow! Here I come!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly restored the consumed Sacred Power and then stepped into the twenty-seventh floor.</span></p></div>
