        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Maddox Corenswet, this can't be </span><span>possible</span><span>, right?" Tyrese furrowed his brow, his tone laced with disbelief. "We've been on the run for so long, and we've already been flying through the cosmos for a while. Even if Osborne did take care of Zayne, there's no way he could catch up to us, no matter how powerful he is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's voice was as cold and cutting as a blade. "That bloke has a Sacredness Level palace! It's at least ten times faster than our war blade!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese, though, remained utterly unfazed. "So what if it is? Even if that palace were a hundred times faster, it wouldn't matter one bit! The cosmos is a vast, bottomless expanse. We picked an escape route at random. No matter how fast he is, there's no way he can figure out where we're going. How on earth could he catch up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a soft chuckle and continued, "Hey, Mr. Maddox Corenswet, you're way too wound up! Okay, that guy's a tough nut and he hit the jackpot with that Sacredness Level palace. It's a once-in-a-blue-moon treasure, even on Racial Convergence Planet. But do you really believe he can hunt us down in this endless expanse of the cosmos? No way! So, just chill out. We're in the clear now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We came to Celestara Planet to back Zayne up. Yeah, we didn't pull it off and Zayne's gone. That means we got zip from this trip... but just reporting the news about the Sacredness Level palace will net us a fortune from the Mystic Sirius Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With that kind of payoff, we'll never have to fret about training resources again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Tyrese wrapped up, the whole group's faces lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might not have snagged the palace, but the intel they held was pure gold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of the handsome rewards from the Empyrean Sacredness warriors at the Mystic Sirius Sect filled them with fresh hope and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew these rewards would easily trump anything Zayne had dangled in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox, however, kept his silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep in his gut, he, too, didn't think Osborne could catch up. Tracking someone across the vast expanse of space was a Herculean task, even for an Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was an insistent gnawing in his chest that had made him change their course earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even after the change, that uneasy feeling refused to budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I just seeing things? Am I losing my mind?" Maddox murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to take one last look at Celestara Planet. It had shrunk to a tiny green marble in the distance, and there was no sign of any pursuers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, they were so far out that they couldn't see much behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless whatever was trailing them was gigantic, it would be invisible to their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum, controlled by Osborne, was only about 330 feet in size. In the vastness of space, it was as insignificant as a speck of dust. Even if someone was following, the distances in space were so immense that anything less than 600 thousand miles away would be practically invisible to the naked eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even 600 thousand miles, in the grand scheme of the cosmos, was just a short hop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, seeing no one behind them, Maddox felt a little better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a calm instruction. "Let's head toward Necoton Planet. It's a small celestial body, but it has a Cosmic Translocator set up by Racial Convergence Planet. Once we're there, we can use the Translocator to return home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only then will we truly be safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese and the others nodded in agreement. "Alright, let's change course for Necoton Planet! At our speed, it'll take about three months to get there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox finally let out a sigh of relief and nodded, fully relaxing for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast one last backward glance at Celestara Planet, a final look over his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in that instant, his eyes widened in sheer horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, hurtling towards them at breakneck speed, was a dilapidated, purple-hued palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One moment, it was hundreds of thousands of miles away; the next, it had covered a staggering distance in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox rubbed his eyes, convinced it was an optical illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he opened them again, the palace was even nearer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese's face drained of all color, and he shot to his feet, bellowing, "Damn it! That son of a bitch actually caught up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! Get the hell out of here!" Maddox shrieked, his voice trembling with sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox was shaken by the sheer power of Osborne. After losing to him previously, Maddox felt a mix of anger and resentment, unwilling to accept defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his attitude changed when he watched Osborne go head-to-head against Lord Malevolence. Despite the myriad of formidable attacks and tricks Lord Malevolence unleashed, Osborne effortlessly countered them, dominating the fight without breaking a sweat. It was at that moment that dread took hold of Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that simply surviving his encounter with Osborne was a stroke of luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prospect of winning against someone of Osborne's strength felt impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne wielding a Sacredness Level palace, even if Maddox's abilities were ten times stronger, he wouldn't stand a chance&mdash;he would simply be crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, witnessing the purple palace barreling toward them, Maddox was consumed by fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese and the others were equally terrified, their hearts racing as they grasped the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They silently prayed that Osborne hadn't spotted them and was just passing by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their prayers fell on deaf ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum loomed larger and larger in their vision, matching their every evasive maneuver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, all seven of them were engulfed by a suffocating sense of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd fallen into Osborne's crosshairs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all over!" someone wailed in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox roared, reacting with lightning-fast reflexes, "Scatter! Save your own skins if you can!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's only one Sacredness Level palace. If we scatter and run, maybe, with enough luck, some of us can make it out alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took off like a shot, and the others quickly followed suit, bolting in all directions in a wild, desperate bid to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood in his palace, a cold, mocking smirk on his face as he watched them flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think running away </span><span>separately </span><span>will do you any good?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can slip through my fingers? Fat chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascending Sacred Sanctum, full speed ahead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The propulsion runes on the palace blazed to life, and it shot forward with even greater speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne zeroed in on Tyrese first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Celestara Planet, Tyrese, at the cultivation level of Ascension Seven, was regarded as one of the most top-notch warriors. Otherwise, Lord Malevolence wouldn't have sought his assistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, unfortunately, in front of the current Osborne, Tyrese at the Ascension Seven level was no more than an ant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Osborne's presence, Tyrese, despite his Ascension Seven level, was hardly stronger than a newly-born infant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Ascending Sacred Sanctum caught up behind Tyrese, despair welled up within him. But he wasn't ready to give in without a fight. He immediately summoned all his strength and launched a desperate counter-attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne launched a merciless attack, shattering Tyrese's defenses in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knocked Tyrese unconscious with a single blow and then casually tossed him aside like a discarded rag doll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, he turned his attention to the remaining fugitives, his pursuit unyielding.</span></p></div>
