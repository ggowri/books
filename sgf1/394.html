        <h1>Chapter 394 Bronze Mirror</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne came to the meeting room and found that it was very lively at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly all members of The Wise Order were present, along with the core senior members of the Augustine family. Even outstanding younger figures like Ryan, Queenie, and Kaden showed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family's cruise ships would leave the port tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac had summoned all the core members of their family to discuss how to ensure the safety of the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their meeting had just ended when someone from the Paltrow family delivered an ancient magic weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Isaac sent Nathan to bring Osborne over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the ancient magic weapon was won by Osborne at the cost of his life, and it belonged to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, come here and take a look at the ancient magic weapon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Osborne, Isaac waved at him in confusion and disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his eyebrows and walked up to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, in front of Isaac lay an open wooden box. The object inside had been removed and was now delicately cradled in Isaac's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an ancient bronze mirror!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed a potent and peculiar energy from its surface, unmistakably similar to the aura he had encountered previously with the Death's Edge and the Sacred Sorceress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the energy fluctuations on the Bronze Mirror were even greater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instantly confirmed that it was definitely an ancient magic weapon at a very high level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite losing the bet, the Paltrow family upheld their promise and, indeed, sent an ancient magic weapon of at least level three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne eagerly gazed into the Bronze Mirror, only to find it was actually broken, and he couldn't help but be stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed to have been attacked. There was a hole in the front surrounded by cracks of various sizes that covered nearly the entire surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the energy of the Bronze Mirror dissipated rapidly from these cracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it broken?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac nodded, then shook his head thoughtfully. "It's not completely broken. Judging by its energy fluctuations, it could indeed qualify as an ancient magic weapon at level three, and it seems stronger than most at that level. If intact, it might even be classified as an ancient magic weapon at a higher level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, "Can I use it then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac smiled bitterly, "That's why I shook my head! I have been studying it for a while, but I can't figure out how to use it. What it is intended for remains unclear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Others have attempted, but none have found a way. Yet, the origin of the Bronze Mirror is undoubtedly profound. We have an expert in antique appraisal who asserts that this ancient magic weapon has a history dating back at least five thousand years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five thousand years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was astonished. A five-thousand-year-old bronze mirror held immense value in the antique world, prized for both its collectability and research significance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carefully took the Bronze Mirror and observed it personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he didn't find a way, either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed that the energy within the Bronze Mirror was immense. If he could harness it, it would undoubtedly greatly enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he simply couldn't make it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bronze Mirror exuded a unique aura that isolated it from external energy flows. Unless this aura could be dispelled, no one could utilize its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tried several times and failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac obviously couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but shake his head in disappointment. "No wonder the Paltrow family was willing to send an ancient magic weapon at level there. It turned out to be unusable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It likely belonged to a lineage of an ancient, extinct family. After it was accidentally obtained by the Paltrow family, they must have extensively studied it and concluded its unavailability before delivering it to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne thought of Isa again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Death's Edge was unusable right after he had just acquired it. He couldn't use it until she erased the aura belonging to the Chevalier family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither he nor Isaac could dispel the aura from the Bronze Mirror, but that didn't mean she couldn't do it either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I should ask Isa for help again," Osborne pondered while holding the Bronze Mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, even though it cannot be used right now, it might prove usable in the future. After all, it's an ancient magic weapon at level three with immeasurable value. Since you won it, it's yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and did not refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, as the heir of the Augustine family, I have never bestowed upon you an ancient magic weapon. Today, I am taking this opportunity to give you one for your self-defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, the Augustine family isn't as powerful as the Paltrow family, and our heritage isn't as long. We lack the ability to provide you with an ancient magic weapon at level three, so I can only offer you a second-level one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you will like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isaac finished speaking, there was a sudden commotion around, and all the Augustine family members looked at Osborne with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a second-level ancient magic weapon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family possessed five ancient magic weapons, with two of them being level two. Previously, only Isaac and the family head had the privilege of using them. However, now Isaac actually allowed Osborne to have one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they not be envious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no objections were raised. Osborne had already demonstrated his strength convincingly. Apart from Isaac, no one in the Augustine family felt confident in defeating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The recent Maritime Auction was of utmost importance to the Augustine family. All core members must be ready for battle and fully armed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All their ancient magic weapons must be taken out and utilized to improve their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, the ancient magic weapon at level two could only be wielded by the stronger Osborne.</span></p></div>
