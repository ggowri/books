        <h1>Chapter 2254 The City Duel-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in his quarters, Osborne immediately settled into a state of seclusion to concentrate on his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sect Tournament had concluded, but he wasn't basking in the glory of his victory; after all, it was merely the Sect Tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, throughout the vast expanse of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, countless Second-rate and First-rate Powers were holding their own Sect Tournaments, and each sect would ultimately crown a champion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such champions, aside from their own sects, would hardly be noticed anywhere else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's sights were set much higher&mdash;he aimed to compete in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being the champion of Mystic Sirius Sect was just the beginning; he still needed to win the city duel in Tempest Fortress City, snag the championship in the Zephyr State duel, and finally secure a top-ten finish in the Eastern Zone 3 zone duel to qualify for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A long and arduous journey had just kicked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dead-set on not letting his newly-won title go to his head. The Glorious Divine Kingdom was vast, teeming with countless tough opponents. He didn't for a second think he was now unbeatable below the Empyrean Sacredness level. Only time would reveal how many prodigies he'd come up against and how much pressure they'd bring to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Failure was out of the question. Osborne had to take part in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, make it to the capital, visit the Royal Sepulcher, and pay his respects to his poor mother from his past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant he had to get even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How can I merge more powers and boost my Sacred Power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>pondered,</span><span> his brow furrowed in deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By fully merging with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he'd acquired several of its amazing abilities. One of them </span><span>allowed him to</span><span> create a Fusion Vessel, which </span><span>enabled</span><span> him to forcefully combine different elemental powers and obtain Sacred Power ahead of schedule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd smartly used this strategy to fuse spatial and dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was eager to merge even more forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>How on earth can I rapidly strengthen the Fusion Vessel? How do I grow more foundational carriers? I feel like I've hit a brick wall. The third carrier base for the Fusion Vessel is within reach, but it just won't budge!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's frown grew deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Gaining Sacred Power at the Supernal Deity King level isn't just for my own sake! In the upcoming city duel, state duel, and even the zone duel, I'm bound to run into opponents who also have Sacred Power!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Once that happens, my advantage will evaporate. They'll have Sacred Power too, and their cultivation levels might well be higher than mine. Beating them will be an uphill battle.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I've got to merge new forces and beef up my Sacred Power to stay ahead of the game!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tried all sorts of ways to break through this bottleneck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly, every attempt ended in failure. The elusive Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, his Fusion Vessel, was still stuck with just two petals, which meant he only had two foundational carriers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third petal stubbornly refused to bloom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, Osborne took a break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he felt a knock on his door. That made him stop meditating and go open up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Osborne! Ms. Olsen sent me to give this to you. It's the info on the opponents you'll face in the upcoming city duel!" Maddox said as he handed over a stack of papers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took the materials gratefully, shut the door, and then dug into the details. As he read through the info, his expression went from focused to shocked.</span></p></div>
