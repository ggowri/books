        <h1>Chapter 140 Fiancé</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna emphasized the words "engagement" with a heavy tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she glanced towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, her remark was deliberately aimed at Osborne, a warning that Clarissa was betrothed, engaged to another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna also felt that Osborne's proactive actions against Raymond were for Clarissa, indicating he still harbored romantic feelings for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she had to make Osborne give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By mentioning Clarissa's Fianc&eacute;, she was issuing a warning to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after she spoke, Osborne remained utterly calm, as if he hadn't heard a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Clarissa clenched her fists tightly, and her pretty face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to Osborne, Clarissa was engaged to Apollo of the Chevalier family. It was a name he hadn't heard, though he was familiar with the family itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chevalier family was an ancient clan no less potent than the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, the Chevalier family could be considered even more formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the Radcliffes were in legitimate business, while the Chevaliers were involved in everything, both legal and illegal</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chevaliers controlled not only a large part of Skyefall's law enforcement but also a third of the city's underground gangs, who were rumored to be secretly backed by the Chevaliers, paying them annual tributes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chevaliers' influence permeates both the legitimate and criminal worlds of Skyefall, their roots running deep like local tyrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Godfather, in terms of influence in Skyefall alone, cannot compare to the Chevaliers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa engaged to Apollo of the Chevalier family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne admitted that he felt a bit uneasy, not because he had feelings for Clarissa but because he had no fondness for the Chevaliers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The underground gangs in Mayby City were incredibly rampant, engaging in drug trafficking, smuggling, kidnapping, gambling, and all sorts of illicit activities, making ordinary citizens like Osborne detest them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the Mayby City law enforcement never intervened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all because of the Chevalier family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Osborne harbored a deep dislike for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, why bring this up? Clarissa's engagement to Apollo was just something from back then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna interrupted Barlyn. "No matter how the engagement came to be, it's irreversible now, and we must honor it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, only by contacting the Chevalier family and having them mobilize law enforcement and the significant gangs can we quickly find Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's for your safety, so you'll have to contact them yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa took a deep breath and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll make the call for the Chevalier family to take action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying this, Clarissa turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched Clarissa's retreating figure with surprise. He could clearly sense her anger and helplessness. Her cold exterior was nothing but a facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cold demeanor was merely a facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned but ultimately remained silent. It was, after all, a private matter for the Radcliffe family, and he was merely the head of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As head of security, Osborne's only responsibility was to protect Clarissa. He quickly followed after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna watched the two leave, her expression shifting constantly. She murmured, "Clarissa, I hope you don't do anything foolish. There are some things you cannot fight against, even as the Radcliffe family's golden child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Being a Radcliffe descendant is your fortune, but also your misfortune."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sigh, she finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, why did you have to bring up Apollo's name? You know that's the last thing Cousin wants to hear. Can't you just not mention it?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was somewhat angry at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna glanced at him coldly and said indifferently, "What's the use of not mentioning it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo is coming back soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finished speaking, and Barlyn froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists, his face darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then Clarissa, she..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna sighed, "This is her fate. Even as the Radcliffe family's golden child, she cannot change this. If we must blame someone, we can only blame ourselves for being too weak to protect her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's face darkened, but he couldn't find any words to refute her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barlyn, if you truly consider Osborne a friend..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's like a brother to me!" Barlyn interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna paused for a moment, seeing the sincerity in Barlyn's eyes. She nodded and continued, "If you consider him a brother, then you must warn him not to harbor any unrealistic fantasies about Clarissa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should know what kind of person Apollo is, and you should also see the power of the Chevalier family. If Osborne dares to have any inappropriate thoughts about Clarissa, neither the Chevalier family nor Apollo will let him off easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It'll be a gruesome end for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In Skyefall, even The Aberrants have to resort to covert assassinations and sneak attacks, but if the Chevalier family wants to kill someone, they'll do it openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Few people targeted by the Chevalier family survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let Osborne seek his own death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After advising, Donna patted Barlyn on the shoulder. "Since you consider him a brother, don't just watch him walk towards his doom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Donna turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn stood there, stunned, his expression frozen, taking a long time to come back to his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne followed closely behind Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his duty as the captain of the bodyguard team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could clearly sense the icy chill emanating from Clarissa. She had been like this ever since Donna mentioned Apollo's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wasn't Apollo her Fianc&eacute;?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was she like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was extremely curious. Unable to contain his curiosity, he lowered his voice and asked, "Ms. Radcliffe, you seem to be troubled. Is there anything I can do to help?"</span></p></div>
