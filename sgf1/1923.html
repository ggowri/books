        <h1>Chapter 1922 Take Action</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After much contemplation, Osborne made up his mind to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings were indeed formidable, but he was a vastly different person now&mdash;not the helpless individual trapped in the Universe-Sealing Formation, waiting for the Hudson family to rescue him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength had grown exponentially since then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First and foremost, his dark, space, and lightning elemental essences had all reached Level Nine, elevating his power to a new pinnacle. The energy he could manipulate was now of a higher caliber, and he had also mastered the Divine Ascendance Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His new techniques&mdash;Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes, Spatial Oblivion Slash, and Multi-thunder Chainstorm&mdash;although yet to be tested in actual combat, were certainly capable of threatening a Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the real trump card up his sleeve was the soul power attack he had recently mastered&mdash;the Divine Ascendance Technique: Soul Spark Oblivion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his formidable soul power, that technique could deal a devastating blow to any Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confident in his abilities, Osborne believed he was more than capable of taking on an Ascension One Supernal Deity King and perhaps even emerging victorious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he knew that only battle would truly test his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If all else fails, I still have the Divine Mark that my grandfather gifted me&mdash;Gale of Netherworld! My grandfather is an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, and this Divine Mark can unleash about 80% of his power! It would definitely inflict severe damage on an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, possibly even eliminate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I must avoid using his Divine Mark unless absolutely necessary; otherwise, the Paramount Supreme Clan might unleash their fury on him, putting him in jeopardy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his plan solidified, Osborne focused on the two Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was an earth elemental, and the other was a fire elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to take down the fire elemental first! Its destructive power is second only to lightning. If I can severely injure or eliminate it, the rest will be much easier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drawing a deep breath, he readied himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in front of the enormous "sapling," the two warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan were completely unaware of the impending ambush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them, named Terry Eldridge, paused in his attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry complained, "What the heck is this thing? Jasper, let's take a breather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The energy barrier around this sapling is impenetrable! With just the two of us, we're bound to tire ourselves out trying to break through. We should dig it out as a whole and think of a plan later! We're on Primordial Divine Peak, and if we attract a Shadow Terror Fiend, we'll be toast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Jasper Eldridge nodded and also ceased his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right, Terry. The energy radiating from this sapling is far too pure; it's definitely not a common find! We may have stumbled upon a super treasure here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's speed things up and get that root excavated quickly and carry it off! Only the esteemed Lord Malevolence will know what it truly is! If we hand it over to him, he won't let us down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grin spread across Terry's face at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were worried we'd miss out on glory by not being sent to the West Zone, but here we are, finding a treasure on Primordial Divine Peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's our lucky day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go help with the digging&mdash;these guys are moving way too slow! Being an earth elemental Supernal Deity King, I can make it go a lot faster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just be careful and keep it quiet!" Jasper replied, nodding in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" Terry said with a wink before darting off to assist the others, unaware of the danger looming just moments away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sapling was firmly rooted in a decayed tree trunk, and in order to carry it away, they needed to excavate the massive root entirely from the hard divine peak soil and rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an earth elemental Supernal Deity King, Terry's digging speed was unmatched by anyone else on the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each surge of his power, he could unearth several hundred yards of the root in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, lacking Satan's Eye, he had no idea that the buried portion of the root extended for thousands of miles beneath the surface. Even with his strength, fully excavating it would take an enormous amount of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Terry worked tirelessly to dig up the root, Jasper, the other Supernal Deity King, remained fixated on the sapling, a glint of greed flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed at the sapling's leaves, imagining them as individual Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a shame I can't break through this barrier!" Jasper mused, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an unsettling sense of danger washed over him, causing his expression to shift in alarm. Before he could react, flames erupted from his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soul Spark Oblivion! Ignite!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had struck, unleashing his soul power through the Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Soul Spark Oblivion. His formidable soul power surged into Jasper's Soul Current Ocean, igniting it like a match to dry tinder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The searing agony of his soul power being ignited forced a piercing scream from Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne materialized just a short distance away, his expression cold and his killing intent palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, he unleashed his second Divine Ascendance Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes!"</span></p></div>
