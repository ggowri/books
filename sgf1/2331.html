        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, congratulations on your victory! I knew you could do it!" Clara exclaimed as she approached him, a bright smile lighting up her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne returned her smile with a calm demeanor. "Thanks! And congratulations to you for coming in second!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara chuckled, "Speaking of second place, I owe you a big thank you. If you hadn't knocked out Leroy, I might not have stood a chance against her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Clara beamed, realizing the significance of Osborne's victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference between second and third place was a hefty thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, equivalent to a thousand Sacred Crystals. Osborne had truly done her a solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's grab a meal sometime and discuss the upcoming state duel! Don't forget our agreement to team up for it," Clara added, her tone enthusiastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Don't worry, I haven't forgotten! Having someone as strong as you by my side will definitely be an advantage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was formidable in her own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought that if Leroy hadn't used the Sacred Artifact, the outcome of a battle between Clara and </span><span>herself</span><span> </span><span>could have been uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he believed Clara's abilities were quite impressive; if she ensnared him with her quasi-Sacred Artifact chains, even he would struggle to break free in a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even if Osborne hadn't put Leroy out cold, Clara might've still snagged second place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara continued, "Sounds good! It's a done deal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's my contact info. The State Duel's in a month, and it'll be in Frost Peak City. We'll probably roll in three days early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anything goes down, give me a shout!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After swapping contact details, Clara took off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up was the awards ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The event went smoothly, and as the champion, Osborne received a quasi-Sacred Artifact&mdash;a ring known as the </span><span>Stormbringer</span><span> Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crafted by a renowned master from Tempest Fortress City, this ring could unleash a terrifying storm attack when activated. It boasted incredible offensive power. This thing packed a serious punch&mdash;hardly anyone below the Empyrean Sacredness level could take it on. And on top of that, it could blind the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It'd come in handy for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, if he ever decided to sell it, it would fetch at least ten thousand Sacred Crystals. Without hesitation, Osborne slipped the ring onto his finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the awards, the expedition ceremony took place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne received a battle robe, symbolizing that he was not just representing Mystic Sirius Sect but also Tempest Fortress City in the upcoming state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we at Azure Haven Academy have to admit, you've earned our respect! For the state duel, we hope you'll join our team and help bring glory to Tempest Fortress City!" the head of Azure Haven Academy said earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swiveled around to face the speaker, weighing the offer in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of giving an immediate yes or no, he merely flashed a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the expedition ceremony wrapped up to thunderous cheers from the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, along with Bethan and Jamar, hopped aboard the Mystic Sirius Sect's warship and made a beeline for home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they touched down, they were greeted by a sea of overjoyed disciples, all dying to welcome their heroes back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had become a living legend within the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a hundred years since a disciple had managed to snag a top-three finish in the city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne's victory in the city duel for the Mystic Sirius Sect had finally given the sect a chance to stand tall and proud in front of the students from Azure Haven Academy and Fantasia Isle.</span></p></div>
