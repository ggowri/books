        <h1>Chapter 216 Continue Merging</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arrived at the hospital's backyard, where several massive lead blocks were scattered around, the largest one weighing in at 10 thousand pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These lead blocks were thick and solid, a challenge even for Class B martial artists or Class B+ ones to leave a mark, let alone destroy them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gripped the Death's Edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This weapon, a short sword measuring 22 inches in length, was slightly longer than a dagger. Its blade was 14 inches long, with an 8-inch hilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Death's Edge was entirely black, seemingly absorbing all light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he held it, the power within the sword surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swung the sword with about 60% of his strength. Instantly, a beam of black sword light shot out, slicing into the lead block.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp sound rang out as the sword light shattered against the lead, but a deep cut appeared on the block.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade had cut into the lead by about two inches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was pleasantly surprised. A two-inch deep gash in the lead block meant that if this had been a person, even a Class B martial artist wouldn't stand a chance, and a Class B+ wouldn't dare to take it head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of this strike was comparable to a full-force attack from a Class B metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Osborne had only used 60% of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see what happens when I channel Devil's Light into the Death's Edge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thought, a red Devil's Light appeared on the black blade, swirling around it. As Osborne swung the sword, a red-black beam of sword light flew out with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening crash followed as the enormous lead block was hurled away, now marred by a horrifying gash that nearly split it in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such an attack could probably cut down a Class B martial artist outright. Even a Class B+ earth elemental metahuman might struggle to withstand it fully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is definitely on par with a Class B+ metahuman's full-strength strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was thoroughly impressed with the Death's Edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is only a level one ancient magic weapon? How powerful must a level two ancient magic weapon be? And a level six ancient magic weapon? They might truly rival the gods!" Osborne murmured to himself as he sheathed the Death's Edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, the Death's Edge would be his weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the Chevalier family won't give up the Death's Edge easily. They'll definitely try to reclaim it! Also, Derek asked me to sign the contract at the Chevalier family's diamond mine in three days, and I suspect that's not entirely above board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Chevalier family won't be willing to just hand over a diamond mine of billions to me. The contract signing in three days is likely a trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Derek is a Class B+ metahuman. Even with the Death's Edge, I might not be able to guarantee victory against him. Plus, the Chevalier family has the Wise Order; there are certainly more experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to continue to increase my strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determination burned in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was currently a Class C+ metahuman, with martial arts skills roughly at Class C. Advancing to Class B was going to be incredibly tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea how to break through to Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The simplest way to boost his power was to keep merging elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At present, he had four types of elemental essence within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earth and water elemental essences had already merged into level one Devil's Light. He still had lightning and wind elemental essences to integrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could merge these remaining essences into Devil's Light, its power would jump from level one to level three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would significantly enhance the Devil's Light's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that level of power, defeating Derek, a Class B+, would become much more manageable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined mindset, Osborne began the merging process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first merge went smoothly and quickly, but this time, it slowed down as the energies started clashing. He needed to blend them, or risk serious complications carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the grand hall of the Chevalier Estate, the family head, Derek, stood alone. Before him loomed three elderly figures, members of the Chevalier family's The Wise Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them was Derek's father, the former head of the family, Karl Chevalier, while the other two were his uncles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karl's voice was icy, filled with scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Derek, do you understand the gravity of your mistakes? As the head of the Chevalier family, your misjudgment has cost us our most promising descendant, Apollo. Not only that, but we've also been forced to put up a staggering 10 billion as a wager, and our family's prized ancient magic weapon has been stolen! Do you grasp the extent of your failure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek clenched his teeth, his face set in a grim line. "Father, I was wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, knowing you're wrong is one thing, but fixing it is another. Apollo is dead, and the ones responsible must pay dearly for it! As for the 10 billion wager, I don't care how you do it, but you must ensure they don't get a cent. And that ancient magic weapon&mdash;we need it back, no excuses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of cold resolve flashed in Derek's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Father. I've already devised a plan. In three days, Skyefall Security Services will be heading to the diamond mine to finalize the contract. I'll mobilize every resource the Chevalier family has. If they dare to go, they won't be coming back alive. Once they're gone, who will be left to claim the wager?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's words were laced with a deadly edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karl gave a curt nod. "Make sure it's done. Failure is not an option. If you can't pull this off, you'd better be prepared to step down as head of the family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Karl and his two brothers raised their hands, and a fierce gale erupted, sweeping them away in a blur of wind and shadow.</span></p></div>
