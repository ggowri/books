        <h1>Chapter 2645 Preparation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana, control your emotions and expressions, don't let the Royal Family notice anything unusual," Osborne quickly reminded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana snapped back to her senses, calmed down, but still said in shock, "Osborne, are you serious?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne replied, "Of course!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Eighth Skyfall Casket key is with me! So Seraphina definitely can't get the Eighth Skyfall Casket key!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not planning to take out the Eighth Skyfall Casket key..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You need to be ready!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Regarding the Eighth Skyfall Casket key, Osborne didn&rsquo;t plan to hide it from Adriana. After all, once Seraphina comes out, everyone will know the Eighth Skyfall Casket key has already been taken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasn&rsquo;t worried that the Royal Family would figure out he took it; he was worried that Frederick, out of humiliation and anger, might do something crazy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick had become somewhat neurotic in his pursuit of breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness. For this, he could even disregard all familial bonds and emotions, sending his own son and daughter to their deaths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And all his hopes were pinned on Necropolis City, on the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick had been preparing for many years to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket and gain a power surge like the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet once did.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If everything goes smoothly, everyone can enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket and rely on their abilities to gain opportunities and power. Although Frederick has the most information and has made the most preparations, making him the most likely to benefit, others still have a chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before coming out of the Eighth Skyfall Casket, Frederick probably won't do anything to others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if the Eighth Skyfall Casket cannot be opened and Frederick loses hope, he might do something crazy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing Frederick the way Osborne did, he&rsquo;d lose his mind&mdash;go full-blown psycho. He&rsquo;d probably wipe out everyone in the room... everyone except the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Frederick hasn't obtained the power he desires, the secrets of Necropolis City cannot be revealed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone who knows about Necropolis City must die!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne informed Adriana of this in advance and decided not to bring out the Eighth Skyfall Casket to open it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hopes Adriana can prepare in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for why Osborne is unwilling to use the key to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket, it's because his purpose in coming here is to stop Frederick from breaking through the cultivation level!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he also knows that opening the Eighth Skyfall Casket benefits everyone present, Osborne is unwilling to do so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He has already gained enough benefits in the Celestial Spire. He doesn't believe the benefits in the Eighth Skyfall Casket will be greater. He would rather gain less himself than let Frederick gain any benefits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, if Frederick really breaks through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, it will be difficult for Osborne to seek revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is doing all this to stop Frederick from breaking through!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as Frederick doesn't break through, Osborne is confident he can take revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick personally ordered Michelle's execution...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He must die too!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was filled with killing intent. After sharing his thoughts with Adriana, she started losing control of her emotions again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "You mean Frederick will come after us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "If the Eighth Skyfall Casket can't be opened, he will definitely be furious! Before opening the Skyfall Casket, he won't allow anyone to leave here and reveal its secrets!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana did not argue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glanced at Frederick in the distance and murmured, "That shouldn't be possible, right? Even though he's a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, we're strong too! Together, the warriors from our sects add up to fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He can't kill us all. I&rsquo;m confident."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana smiled confidently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her strength, even if not as great as Frederick's, wasn't far behind. It was absolutely impossible for Frederick to kill them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "What if Frederick still has a trump card? Like mastering an Imperial Artifact?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Imperial Artifact?" Adriana exclaimed, "Impossible. Imperial Artifacts aren't easy to obtain! Even Frederick and the past monarchs of the Glorious Divine Kingdom have never used an Imperial Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless, disagreeing with her words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On him, there were dozens of Imperial Artifacts, ranging from low-grade Imperial Artifacts to mid-grade, top-grade, and even stronger ones.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick has ruled the Glorious Divine Kingdom for tens of thousands of years, so he must have had opportunities to obtain Imperial Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It would be trouble if he had an Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Osborne believed Frederick was highly likely to possess an Imperial Artifact, and most likely had a trump card capable of killing Adriana and the fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick never does anything he's not confident about!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He dared to bring fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors with him to Necropolis City to explore the Eighth Skyfall Casket, so he must have been fully prepared and confident in controlling the situation under all circumstances, including eliminating everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne grew even more worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana, if I give you a low-grade Imperial Artifact now, can you use it?" Osborne asked quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana didn&rsquo;t know why Osborne asked this, but she still answered truthfully, &ldquo;Of course not! Imperial Artifacts are incredibly powerful. Even the Fairy Moon Sect doesn&rsquo;t have an Imperial Artifact! Even though I&rsquo;m a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, I&rsquo;d need to harmonize with an Imperial Artifact first to use it. Otherwise, not only would I fail to unleash its power, but I&rsquo;d also risk backlash!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I suddenly got an Imperial Artifact without harmonizing with it, its power wouldn&rsquo;t even match my usual Supreme Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Adriana, Osborne grew even more worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She asked, "Osborne, why are you asking this? Do you have an Imperial Artifact?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, he had Imperial Artifacts, and plenty of them. He didn&rsquo;t mind giving one to Adriana to boost her strength, so she could better deal with Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The problem was that even if he gave an Imperial Artifact to Adriana, she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use it or unleash its power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least not in the short term!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had no better solution and could only say, "Adriana, quietly inform those you trust and have them prepare for Frederick's possible attack at any time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The rest will be decided based on the situation later!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne was speaking, he suddenly sensed a wave of energy in the distance. A somewhat disheveled figure abruptly appeared in front of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Seraphina!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina also emerged from the Celestial Spire!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone became excited upon seeing Seraphina appear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most excited among them was Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his body was trembling slightly. He immediately brought Seraphina over from the Celestial Spire. His immense power remained active, still shielding her, as if he was deeply afraid someone might harm Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick stared at her intently and asked excitedly, "Where is the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand it over immediately!"</span></p></div>
