        <h1>Chapter 1875 Suppression</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way!" Zachary finally couldn't hold back any longer and shouted at Osborne, his face etched with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was genuinely worried that Osborne might get hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Virgil hesitated at that moment, contemplating whether he should hold back his attack. He knew that if he harmed Osborne, Zachary would undoubtedly deal with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Osborne made his move. With a slight smile, a surge of spatial fluctuation radiated from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce gales that had been swirling around him slammed into the spot where he had stood, leaving deep, jagged marks on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had disappeared without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Virgil and Zachary sensed the spatial fluctuations and gasped in disbelief, "Spatial power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne appeared right behind Virgil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised a finger, and a wave of spatial fluctuation flickered. In an instant, the divine power defense Virgil had on his back was shattered, a crack forming on his body as blood began to flow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Virgil, you can't afford to be distracted in battle. It makes you an easy target."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Virgil processed the voice behind him and the pain coursing through his body, his expression shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's real spatial power! Incredible! It broke through my divine power defense so easily and even wounded my Divine Body. If Osborne had gone all out, I might be seriously hurt right now," he murmured, his seriousness returning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer dwelling on how Osborne had acquired spatial power, Virgil felt a surge of determination. He refused to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the top genius of the Hudson family, the heir, and an advanced-level Deity King, he was not about to be bested by someone at the mid-level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come again!" Virgil shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength Osborne had displayed jolted Virgil out of his complacency. He became completely serious. The winds around him intensified to a fierce gale, and his strength amplified two or threefold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he had only tapped into a fraction of his strength earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!" Virgil shouted, now fully committed. Merging with the gale, he lunged toward Osborne in an instant, unleashing a powerful punch that transformed the swirling gales into a menacing Wind Tornado barreling toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent! Let's see what you've got!" Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, instead of using his spatial power to evade, he quickly summoned his spatial energy to create a spatial barrier in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the ferocious Phoenix Tornado crashed into the spatial barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the sheer force of the gale as it relentlessly tore at his defenses. Again and again, the barrier succumbed to the assault, and within moments, it shattered into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive!" Osborne's eyes sparkled. Virgil's strength was comparable to that of Caesar, one of the Five Brilliant Scions of the Paramount Supreme Clan. At least in terms of attack power, they were on par.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne was merely a Spatial Clone at that moment, he could still wield the spatial energy of his true self&mdash;equivalent to half of Osborne's actual combat strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, Virgil's ability to breach his barrier was commendable, but it wouldn't be enough to defeat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a faint smile, Osborne unleashed more spatial energy, summoning layers of barriers to block the furious Gale Tornadoes. In the blink of an eye, he expended all his strength, vanishing once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil's expression shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such an impenetrable defense?" He bit his lip. "Let's go again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil's aura intensified, and the howling gales grew even more terrifying. The spatial barrier in front of Osborne crumbled layer by layer, unable to recover in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, as the last of the barriers shattered, joy flickered across Virgil's face, but it was short-lived as Osborne vanished yet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Virgil's smile froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spatial power! He was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had finally broken through Osborne's defense, but Osborne had simply dodged without any trace?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was utterly uncatchable. Even Zachary was powerless to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Virgil sensed a threat looming behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Virgil, now it's your turn to experience my attack!" Osborne called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil bit his lip tightly. "Bring it on, Osborne! Give it everything you've got!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Virgil began to focus on defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Virgil felt the air around him begin to crack and warp, collapsing inward with ferocious intensity. The overwhelming force bore down on his defenses, ripping through them and his body with brutal efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Virgil coughed up blood and was violently hurled backward, crashing hard against the ground.</span></p></div>
