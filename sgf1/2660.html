        <h1>Chapter 2543 Eliminate Frenetic Storm Warband</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Theodore was also utterly desperate, and in the canyon, so were all the slaves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magnus is here!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were about to be killed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mid-to-high-ranking members of the Frenetic Storm Warband had almost all gone to the Phantomagic Realm and died there. On this resource-bearing planet, only one advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior was left behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Magnus!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he is the strongest warrior of the Frenetic Storm Warband. Previously, those powerful slaves joined forces, injured him, and managed to escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magnus was furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, after recovering from his injuries, he immediately led people to hunt down the escaped slaves. Any slave caught by him would be tortured or even killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, he sensed a strong energy fluctuation here and rushed over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He coldly stared at Vivienne, Theodore, and the others, intending to kill them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne and Theodore trembled uncontrollably with fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magnus is an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior, while they are merely Ascension Seven Supernal Deity Kings, making it impossible to defeat him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Magnus could easily kill them all!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, Vivienne and Theodore firmly stood in front of Osborne. Despite their bodies trembling with fear, they still protected Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne not leaving, Vivienne became extremely anxious and urged, "Osborne, go quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm already very happy that I could see you and know you've grown up safely. Even if I die, it doesn't matter! But you can't die here. Hurry and leave!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if your father and I sacrifice ourselves, we won't let you get hurt!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A determined expression appeared on Vivienne's scarred face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt warmth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a deep breath, shot a cold glance at Magnus, and approached his parents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, Mom, I'm not leaving!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm here this time specifically to find and save you! Now, we've finally reunited. Standing in my way is just an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior. Even if it were an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior or a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, they can't separate us again!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will kill anyone who tries to stop our reunion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glared at Magnus and growled, "Everyone in the Frenetic Storm Warband deserves to die! You will die too! All of you will die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magnus felt surprised, then looked at Osborne with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had already put away the Sublime Concealment Orb, returning to his true appearance, his normal cultivation level, and aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, in Magnus's eyes, Osborne was just an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "An Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King dares to challenge me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He saves people right in front of me and even wants to kill us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magnus couldn't help but laugh out loud and mocked, "How foolish! As an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, you want to kill me? You must have lost your mind! Since you're here, don't even think about leaving. Stay and become our slave too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved to his subordinates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He coldly ordered, "Capture them! If anyone dares to resist, kill them directly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magnus's subordinates immediately sneered and approached Osborne and his parents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors, even mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were more than a dozen of them. At this moment, they viciously surrounded Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a situation terrified Vivienne and Theodore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bad news!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne sneered, "It will be you who die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he immediately launched an attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To deal with these people, he didn't even need to use the Bloodwrought Bow or any Sacred Artifact. He just needed to unleash Sacred Power and throw a punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, accompanied by a thunderous boom, the bodies of several primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors in front of Osborne were directly blown apart by him. They didn't even have time to react before they were completely dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne vanished mysteriously. In the blink of an eye, he reappeared in front of several others. He threw another punch, killing them instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another thunderous boom erupted!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone just felt this scene was somewhat blinding. All those dozen primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors and mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors from the Frenetic Storm Warband surrounding them were dead. Their bodies had all exploded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne was now in front of Magnus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He coldly stared at Magnus and grabbed his throat. No matter how Magnus unleashed his Sacred Power, he couldn't break free from Osborne's grip.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was struggling to breathe, his cheeks flushed red, and he felt terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t give Magnus a chance to speak, snapping his neck. Then, Osborne&rsquo;s Sacred Power erupted, blasting his body into pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magnus's blood splattered but was blocked by an invisible force. Not a single drop of his blood or piece of flesh touched Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, everything around became utterly silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne and Theodore stared at Osborne in shock, feeling incredulous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought, "Magnus is an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he just died like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His neck was easily crushed by Osborne. Even his body was shattered?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is Osborne so strong?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other slaves were even more stunned at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They felt that Theodore and Vivienne's son was simply a demon god!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magnus, the strongest warrior of the Frenetic Storm Warband, was easily killed by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, we're saved, right?" someone murmured, their face full of excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is so powerful. Even Magnus was easily killed. The rest of the Frenetic Storm Warband couldn't possibly be his match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Frenetic Storm Warband is doomed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And these slaves are saved. They will all regain their freedom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne turned to look at Vivienne and Theodore, saying, "Dad, Mom, don't worry. Now, I can protect you! Everyone in the Frenetic Storm Warband deserves to die! Wait a moment. I'll go finish them all off first, then reunite with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he soared into the sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Standing high in the sky, Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, targeting the members of the Frenetic Storm Warband on the resource-bearing planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, he took out the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is he going to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne and Theodore exchanged a glance, a bit puzzled. Everyone else was equally confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Human Arrow, Arrow Storm!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sacred Power Arrow shot out, instantly splitting into ten, a hundred, even a thousand arrows...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, countless Sacred Power Arrows filled the sky, each locking onto a member of the Frenetic Storm Warband, swiftly shooting out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, on this resource-bearing planet, countless explosions erupted. At this moment, no matter where the members of the Frenetic Storm Warband were, each of them was instantly struck by a terrifying Sacred Power Arrow, piercing through their bodies without leaving a single part of their corpses behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pulled the Bloodwrought Bow three times in a row, shooting Sacred Power Arrows in different directions. After that, the entire resource-bearing planet fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No members of the Frenetic Storm Warband were left alive. Even the battleships in the void were blasted by Osborne's Sacred Power Arrows, turning into massive sparks and crashing down with a roar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, only silence remained.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, on the resource-bearing planet, the surviving slaves looked up in shock at Osborne in midair, who, like a war god, annihilated the Frenetic Storm Warband with three arrows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne and Theodore were once again shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is he really our son?"</span></p></div>
