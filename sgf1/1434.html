        <h1>Chapter 1433 One Punch</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the last Transcendent Deity Deathborn shattered under Jeffrey's powerful strike, the battlefield fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood splattered across Jeffrey's body, yet his face wore a confident grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crisis in the No. 9 mining area had been dealt with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he returned, this victory would add a significant notch to his accomplishments. When a chiliarch position opened up in the Wild Flame Army, he knew his efforts would put him ahead of the pack for promotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought filled Jeffrey with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, he pushed thoughts of glory and advancement aside and turned to glare coldly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others joined in, their eyes gleaming with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all the Deathborn eliminated, they understood that Jeffrey was now focused on dealing with the "Lachlan," that pathetic member of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, you've got some guts, sticking around instead of running off!" Jeffrey said icily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, "Run? Why would I run? You're not worthy of making me flee!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey burst into laughter, and his companions joined in, as if they had just heard the funniest joke in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, it seems your brain's really scrambled! As a lowly human, you dare to speak to me like that? I'm still your superior! You must be itching for a death wish! Since that's the case, let's do this! I'll give you a fair shot at fighting me. If you manage to defeat me, who knows? I might just let you live!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey's eyes sparkled with derision as he finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, his tone calm. "Bring it on. Let's see just how much power your so-called noble race really has."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne began to walk toward Jeffrey, each step deliberate and steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey narrowed his eyes and waved his hand, signaling the others to step back and clear the battlefield for their confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere among the onlookers was relaxed; no one believed Osborne stood a chance against Jeffrey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they had been teammates long enough to know each other's strengths and weaknesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan was decent enough, and even the other four Transcendent Deity squad leaders might struggle against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But facing Jeffrey? He was simply outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They watched Osborne with a mix of amusement and anticipation, eager to see Jeffrey teach him a brutal lesson, to see this lowly human crushed underfoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like we're about to have a squad leader vacancy soon! Lachlan's definitely going to get taken out by Mr. Alick; the real question is, how long can he last?" one of them remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I give him twenty moves before Mr. Alick turns him into a bloody pulp!" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty? I think ten moves would be generous!" someone else scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're giving Lachlan too much credit. A lowly human? He'll be lucky to last five moves, maybe even three before he's done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Alick, take him down in the most brutal way possible!" another shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!" the crowd echoed, their voices rising in a chant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, Jeffrey replied, "Don't worry, I won't let you down! It's been a while since I've had the chance to toy with a pathetic Human Community member. I'm ready to get back in the groove. Lachlan, are you prepared to be thoroughly humiliated?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "You guys really love to talk, don't you? It's just a matter of throwing a punch, yet you insist on dragging it out. What a waste of time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey raised an eyebrow at that, a cold smirk creeping onto his face. "A punch, huh? Sounds like you're not very confident in your abilities. You think you can't even take one hit from me? Ha! At least you know your limits! But don't worry, I won't kill you quickly. I promised to savor every moment of your suffering!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was as frigid as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne simply smiled calmly, "No, I didn't say I couldn't take your punch. I said... you won't be able to handle mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, an eerie silence enveloped the area. Jeffrey froze for a moment, then burst into laughter, his companions joining in, their voices echoing with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained unfazed, his smile unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, after what felt like an eternity, Osborne tapped into his spatial elemental essence once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of space began to ripple and spread around him, silent yet overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spatial Domain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Level Five, one could merge with time and space, becoming intangible and nearly impossible to shatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's mastery of the space elemental essence had far surpassed Level Five, reaching the pinnacle of Level Six. His Spatial Domain was a force to be reckoned with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just how powerful was a Level Six pinnacle Realm? Osborne himself couldn't say for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, he felt as if the area enveloped by his Spatial Domain was a different world altogether, one where everything was under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, he was incredibly powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Jeffrey and the others were completely unaware of the shift in their reality. They had no idea that they were now trapped within Osborne's Spatial Domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within this Realm, unless their strength exceeded Osborne's, escaping was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were cut off from the outside world, unable to send out any messages or calls for help.</span></p></div>
