        <h1>Chapter 1936 A World-shattering Battle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced as he surveyed the scene before him. The 50 Paramount Supreme Clan warriors he observed were all powerful, with the weakest among them being an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over ten of them were Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings, and three rated Ascension Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, to his sheer disbelief, there was even one Ascension Five Supernal Deity King leading the charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Ascension Five Supernal Deity King?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock as he noticed the five distinct steps hovering above the figure's head. The most astonishing part was how this Ascension Five Supernal Deity King was holding his own against the relentless assault from the Shadow Terror Fiend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark power emanating from him was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was undoubtedly the strongest person Osborne had ever encountered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that... Lord Malevolence?" Osborne murmured, both thrilled and terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he quickly dismissed the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the dark energy felt potent and pure, it lacked the unmistakable signature of Lord Malevolence's formidable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne released a breath he hadn't realized he was holding, but that relief quickly morphed into anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man's presence indicated that Lord Malevolence was even stronger than he had assumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could he be one of Lord Malevolence's Nine Dark Sovereigns?" Osborne speculated inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he was surprised to hear the Shadow Terror Fiend's voice cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Nine, you're begging for trouble! I allowed you Paramount Supreme Clan to roam around the western side of Epochal Divine Peak, but that doesn't include the core area! You've crossed the line! Get out now, and I'll spare your lives! Otherwise, even if Lord Malevolence himself arrived, he wouldn't be able to save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend's voice boomed, thick with a chilling menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recognized that name&mdash;Icy Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just as I suspected! He's indeed one of Lord Malevolence's Nine Dark Sovereigns, ranked ninth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to be this powerful? An Ascension Five Supernal Deity King holding his ground against the Shadow Terror Fiend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind raced, filled with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had previously thought that Lord Malevolence was no more than an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King himself, but now it was clear&mdash;he had grossly underestimated the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Icy Nine, ranked lowest among the Nine Dark Sovereigns, was already sitting at Ascension Five, the top ranks&mdash;Icy One and Icy Two&mdash;were likely Ascension Six Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And who knew how powerful Lord Malevolence truly was?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Seven? Ascension Eight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization struck him like a blow, filling him with a mix of awe and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current abilities, Osborne could handle an Ascension One Deity King without much trouble, but an Ascension Two? That would prove incredibly challenging. Even with all his tricks, defeating one was far from guaranteed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between each Ascension was immense, making it extremely difficult to overcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for an Ascension Three Deity King?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought was paralyzing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he encountered one now, running away would be his only option. Osborne couldn't even entertain the idea of standing his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to whispers, the threshold between Ascension Three and Ascension Four was monumental. Once crossed, a warrior's power could skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened as he shook his head, trying not to dwell on thoughts of Lord Malevolence&mdash;he wasn't a concern for him right now, not with the God of Night and God of Light already in the mix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He refocused on the ongoing battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the moment, it seemed the fighting had stalled. The 50 Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan had formed a tight circle around the Shadow Terror Fiend, led by Icy Nine, but they were holding back, not rushing into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What in the world are they doing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems like the Shadow Terror Fiend actually knows Lord Malevolence! There's definitely some sort of arrangement between them that allows the Paramount Supreme Clan to operate on the western side of Epochal Divine Peak, but only within a limit of one hundred twenty thousand miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Icy Nine leading the Paramount Supreme Clan deeper into the peak, they've crossed the line, and that's what triggered this battle," Osborne thought, piecing together the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Icy Nine scoffed, his voice dripping with disdain. "Creation Herald, don't try to intimidate me! You know better than anyone what your situation is. You're in no position to challenge us, let alone the esteemed Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend's expression darkened at those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? Did Lord Malevolence send you here? Is he trying to throw me under the bus? That's a death wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine's face twisted into a sneer. "Creation Herald, you should be more concerned about your own survival!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether you make it through this ordeal is still up in the air, and you dare to threaten the esteemed Lord Malevolence? Let me tell you the truth&mdash;he's currently in seclusion, and when he emerges, his power will have increased dramatically!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, the Shadow Terror Fiend fell silent, absorbing the weight of the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, he finally spoke, his voice cold as ice, "So what do you want? My agreement with Lord Malevolence is based on a boundary of 1.2 million miles! You've crossed that line!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think I won't kill you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine merely smiled, "Of course you could kill us! But the unfortunate truth is that you can't. We didn't come here to fight with you. We have just one request. If you agree, we'll turn around and leave without causing you any trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend's eyes narrowed. "A request? You think you're in a position to make demands of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine's voice turned icy. "If you're not willing to hear us out, then there's nothing left to discuss. Let's just go straight to war!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension crackled in the air, and the Shadow Terror Fiend's gaze turned lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he restrained himself, saying, "Fine. Since you're Lord Malevolence's man, speak your request! But if it's unreasonable, don't blame me! Even in my current state, I can still wipe you out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine replied smoothly, "It's a perfectly reasonable request!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed Lord Malevolence is currently in seclusion and needs a significant amount of Miracle Elixirs. As his subordinates, we can't help him in any other way, so we're here to gather Miracle Elixirs! Unfortunately, we've already cleaned out the western side of Epochal Divine Peak, but we still need more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, our request is simple. Lend us 100 thousand Miracle Elixirs and grant us access to the outer 1.2 million miles of the eastern, southern, and northern sides of Epochal Divine Peak, allowing us to gather more Miracle Elixirs. If you agree, we'll leave immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, the Shadow Terror Fiend exploded with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to 'borrow' 100 thousand Miracle Elixirs? And you want access to the outer 1.2 million miles of Epochal Divine Peak to scavenge for more? You must be dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend was now thoroughly furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paramount Supreme Clan, you've become far too arrogant! If I don't teach you a lesson, you'll really think I'm afraid of you! I'll wipe you all out today, and then you can cool your heads!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, the Shadow Terror Fiend launched himself into action.</span></p></div>
