        <h1>Chapter 1438 Imminent Breakthrough</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transformation proceeded flawlessly. With their powers as Superior Deities utterly failing them, Chester and his group were swiftly and forcibly converted into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave them a stern command to cease harassing the human miners before allowing them to go their own way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then returned to the mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My space elemental essence is back to full strength, and Phantom Steps are ready to roll! No more messing with earth power, just straight to the heart of the mine&mdash;easy as pie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned and, in one step, vanished into a parallel space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armed with a map of the No. 9 mining area, he made his way toward the region known for yielding top-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His journey through the parallel space rendered the solid rock barriers ineffectual, swiftly bringing him to the heart of the No. 9 mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Divine Body fully restored, he felt a nascent breakthrough in his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back on Blue Planet, he had already pushed his Satan's Eye to the pinnacle of Level Eight with the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the incomplete rules of Blue Planet had barred any further progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, in Celestara, with a healed body and complete cosmic rules, the breakthrough felt imminent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "If that's the case, let's prioritize the breakthrough of the Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Achieving Level Nine, I wonder what new abilities it might unlock. At the very least, my X-ray vision will become stronger, making the search for top-grade Essence Crystals more effortless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting cross-legged, Osborne focused his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Satan's Eye, a bloodline power of the Augustine family, was nothing short of formidable. It had been the bedrock of his rise&mdash;without it, he might still have been a mere ordinary soul on Blue Planet or perhaps long deceased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had propelled him to the zenith of Blue Planet and now to Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Level One, the Satan's Eye merely enhanced his vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By Level Two, it granted him the ability to see through anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Three allowed him to manipulate matter, while Level Four enabled him to absorb others' elemental essences into his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Five introduced psychic power, casting illusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By Level Six, he could alter memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Seven brought time power, allowing him to halt time in a specific area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Eight enhanced these powers, adding the ability to slow, speed up, or even reverse time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what would Level Nine bring?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had ever pushed the Satan's Eye that far, and Osborne was eager with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had grown less reliant on it; even if Level Nine didn't bring formidable new abilities, the enhancements to his existing powers would suffice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was more than enough for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to break through. This time, I don't have to use core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deft maneuver, Osborne cast a temporal acceleration effect around himself. At his current prowess, this spell would make time within his personal space flow ten times faster than the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In essence, ten days of his intensive training would equate to a single day passing in the external realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This granted him a significant advantage, effectively multiplying his cultivation time by tenfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this heightened temporal state, Osborne settled into deep meditation, feeling the pulsation of his Satan's Eye as it quietly underwent profound changes, steadily pushing towards the elusive Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days passed gradually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, on the third day, Osborne felt his Satan's Eye hit the absolute limit of Level Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden, brilliant burst of light, his Satan's Eye underwent a complex, transformative evolution, shattering through the barrier and ascending to Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Nine Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unprecedented pinnacle of power was unlike anything anyone had ever achieved. At this moment, Osborne felt not only his Satan's Eye transforming but also his body and soul resonating with this new elevation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A radiant light shot forth from his left eye, initially a pale silver that quickly deepened to a golden hue and ultimately settled into a rich, regal purple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The purple grew more intense and dignified until, in an instant, the mystical light vanished, marking the end of the breakthrough.</span></p></div>
