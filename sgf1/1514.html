        <h1>Chapter 1513 A Prodigy From an Upper Race</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Gellar family's Essence Crystal mine has never relied on slaves for excavation. We depend solely on our clan members and hire people from the Human Community for the work. Because of this, our output has always been limited, making us poorer than most major factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, with the sudden influx of Deathborn, we've had to halt all mining operations to prevent casualties among our workers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this continues, our family will be in serious financial trouble, and I might not even have any Essence Crystals left for my own cultivation," Hannah explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed, "I want to solve this problem for my family, but after thinking it through, I realized it would be too dangerous to tackle this alone. That's why I came to you for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though you've just broken through to Celestial Deity, your Thunder Power can counter the Deathborn to some extent. Plus, your speed allowed you to outmaneuver Deity Overlord Fabian, so I believe you can handle yourself. I hope you'll join me in going to the Gellar family's Essence Crystal mine to deal with the Deathborn and figure out why they're gathering there in such numbers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah looked at Osborne with hopeful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will you help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. Hannah wanted him to help clear out a mine full of Deathborn? It felt like a gift dropped right in his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been struggling to find a way to locate and deal with a large number of Deathborns to restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden appearance of these Deathborns in the Gellar family's mine seemed almost tailor-made for him. Even if Hannah hadn't approached him, he would have rushed over upon hearing the news to eliminate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he could also assist Hannah in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne feigned a look of indecision, pretending to weigh his options. Just as Hannah began to look downcast, fearing he might turn her down, he finally spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'll help you! It might delay some of my plans, but since you're from the Mystic Feather Clan and have Human Community blood, I'll begrudgingly join you to check it out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's face lit up with excitement, her gratitude evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on, don't thank me just yet. Before we head out, I need to make it clear&mdash;if we run into any Deathborns that are too tough to handle, I won't risk my life for it. And since this is a team effort, you should probably tell me what your current level of power is. If you're too weak, I'd suggest you stay home and just give me the location. I don't want to be fighting Deathborns while trying to protect you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Hannah chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her confidence radiated as she replied calmly, "Don't worry! If we encounter any Deathborns that are too much for us, I won't hesitate to run. After all, no matter how important the Essence Crystal mine is, my life comes first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for my power level, you don't need to worry! I can definitely handle myself! I'm at the peak of the Celestial Deity realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, flames of divine fire suddenly erupted above her head, five brilliant flames burning brightly with a soft blue glow, dazzling in their intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's jaw dropped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The peak of Celestial Deity? You actually have a Level Six Divine Body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had sensed Hannah's strength was no joke, but he hadn't expected her to be so young and already at the peak of Celestial Deity, just a step away from becoming a Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most impressively, she possessed a Level Six Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made her the first person he had encountered below the Deity Overlord level, aside from his sister Anastasia and the young girl Mila, who had a Level Six Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Hannah was a true prodigy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theoretically, if someone could achieve a Level Five Divine Body upon breaking through to the Celestial Deity realm, they had a good shot at advancing to Deity Overlord and even a decent chance at reaching the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to have a Level Six Divine Body while still in the Celestial Deity realm? That almost guaranteed Hannah would become a Deity King sooner rather than later, as long as she didn't meet an untimely end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Hannah had the potential to become a Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Feather Clan truly lives up to its reputation as an Upper Race! With talent like Hannah's, she must be among the best of her generation," Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the surprise on Osborne's face, Hannah couldn't help but puff her chest out a bit, wrinkling her nose playfully. "So, are you reassured now? My strength is greater than yours, so if we run into trouble, it'll be me protecting you. Just make sure to stick close and shout for help if things get dicey!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled at her confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't argue; given his current strength, he wouldn't bet on taking her in a straight fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's abilities were on a whole different level compared to Kerwin's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a prodigy from an Upper Race, she could hold her own against a typical Deity Overlord. Unless Osborne managed to break through to become a Transcendent Deity, defeating her would be a tall order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speaking of which, I'm on the verge of breaking through to Transcendent Deity myself!" he mused.</span></p></div>
