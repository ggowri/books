        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's eyes were filled with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, we have a common enemy, don't we? Although you're still weak now and can't change much, I believe in your future!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick... it's not that easy for him to destroy my Fairy Moon Sect. Relying on the defensive formation of the Fairy Moon Sect, I'm confident I can lead the sect to hold out long enough, long enough for you to grow stronger..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, the situation will turn around!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana looked at Osborne. "This is the real reason I invited you to join the Fairy Moon Sect! You want to deal with the Royal Family, and I want to stop the Royal Family from destroying the Fairy Moon Sect. We can join forces!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared blankly at Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The news Adriana told him was truly shocking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick forcing Adriana to marry him? To have his children? Even making the Fairy Moon Sect a vassal of the Royal Family? And the final deadline is right after leaving Necropolis City?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder Adriana is unwilling!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder Adriana suddenly doesn't care about offending the Royal Family...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick is threatening Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing Adriana, Osborne is sure she'd rather die than agree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne lowered his head in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How about it? Join the Fairy Moon Sect, and let's take on the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom together! I'm strong enough&mdash;though my current strength may still fall short of Emperor Frederick, and the Fairy Moon Sect's power is far from matching the Royal Family! But at least with me around, they won't crush us so easily!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With me here, I can protect you and stop the Royal Family from killing you so easily!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you have a future..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Become an honorary Elder of the Fairy Moon Sect, and how about we overthrow the Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family together?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled and tempted Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a wry smile, "Ms. Alba, you overestimate me, but... I admit you've convinced me! So, thank you for your fourth invitation. This time, I won't refuse."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a sharp gleam flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, he was unwilling to join the Fairy Moon Sect because he truly didn&rsquo;t want to drag them down. The Fairy Moon Sect was thriving, and there was no need for them to be implicated by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, the Fairy Moon Sect had already caught the Royal Family's attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the latest, by the time they emerged from Necropolis City, Frederick would use the Royal Family's power against the Fairy Moon Sect, possibly even wiping it off the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And within the Fairy Moon Sect, there were still Isa, Clarissa, Anastasia, and others!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Osborne didn&rsquo;t join the Fairy Moon Sect, he couldn&rsquo;t just stand by and watch it be destroyed. By then, he would definitely step in to help the Fairy Moon Sect and save Isa, Clarissa, and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And also, Adriana and Angela!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since that's the case, he might as well join the Fairy Moon Sect directly. At least by joining, he would have allies, and even if he encountered someone he couldn't handle, Adriana could help him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Adriana's strength...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the entire Royal Family, aside from Frederick, no one is her match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled when she heard Osborne agree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From now on, you are the Honorary Elder of the Fairy Moon Sect! This is the Honorary Elder token, which proves your identity!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the Fairy Moon Sect, your status is second only to me and the two vice palace masters!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana took out a token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The token emitted an incredibly powerful force, instantly stunning Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the Supreme Sacred Artifact?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled faintly, "That's right! It's called the Star Token! There are only five of these tokens in total! One is with me, two are with the vice palace masters, and the remaining one, I have already given to Isa!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Five Star Tokens, all Supreme Sacred Artifacts! In critical moments, they can unleash a defense, block a fatal attack for you, and take you to a safe place!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides that, those who possess a Star Token can call for help from others with a Star Token when in danger! Others can quickly teleport over to assist through the Star Token..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Adriana finished speaking, Osborne's eyes lit up even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is a good thing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The value of this Star Token is higher than most Supreme Sacred Artifacts!"</span></p></div>
