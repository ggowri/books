        <h1>Chapter 2318 Debate-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maisie's expression turned sour as she confronted the accusations from Ezra and the other vice-presidents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was left tongue-tied, unable to come up with a single excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prior to the state duel, she'd made it crystal clear to Leroy that she was to back Jared whole-hog and help him snag a top-ten spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But on the very first day of the duel, Leroy had gone head-to-head with Jared, and as a result, she'd had to pull out of the team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, the seven vice-presidents were a bit let down, but they didn't kick up a big stink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Jared was on fire. He led his team straight into the top ten, and things were looking rosy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Jared's success, Leroy's departure was quickly swept under the rug. Since Leroy was no longer on the team, Azure Haven Academy was out of the running for the top-ten glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, the tide turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jared and his crew cornered Leroy and Clara, the other seven vice-presidents were over the moon. They were cracking jokes and having a ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ezra even ribbed Maisie, saying that after getting beaten, Leroy would end up being an unexpected asset to Jared's team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Jared made it to the top ten, Leroy would get a slice of the credit, and that would be a feather in Azure Haven Academy's cap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But not long after Ezra's quip, Osborne showed up like a knight in shining armor, rescuing Leroy and Clara. Then, he laid waste to Jared and his entire team with ruthless efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the seven vice-presidents went as quiet as mice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, all hell broke loose. They flew into a rage and turned their fury on Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ezra fixed Maisie with a cold stare and said icily, "Ms. Maisie Holiday, Leroy has to be given a harsh punishment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All of us from the Eight Great Academies have poured our hearts and souls into this state duel, dreaming of a top-ten finish. But now, thanks to Leroy, everything's going down the drain! Jared's hurt, and we're practically out of the running for that top ten. Our chances have been completely shot to hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're holding Azure Haven Academy accountable! You've got to make proper amends to the other seven academies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maisie bit her lip, the frustration churning inside her like a tempest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't pin the blame for our failure to make the top ten on Leroy! If anyone's to blame, it's Jared. He just didn't cut the mustard. He's no leader!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, Jared misread the situation and picked a fight with someone he couldn't take on. He not only failed to score points off others, but he also lost his own and ended up getting himself hurt! What a mess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Jared hadn't led the team so poorly, Leroy would never have clashed with him and had to pull out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if Jared had been tough enough, he wouldn't have been beaten by Osborne and landed in the hospital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, Maisie shot Jared a scathing look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's be real. If we don't make the top ten, it's Jared who should shoulder the blame&mdash;you and your Radiant Enigmas Academy. Maybe things would have turned out differently if Leroy had been the captain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words left the seven vice presidents stunned into silence for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did she really just twist it like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ezra was trembling with outrage. "Ms. Maisie Holiday, this is ridiculous! Jared is at the top of the rankings, the strongest of all! Who else would you suggest we choose as captain? It's not Leroy's call!</span></p></div>
