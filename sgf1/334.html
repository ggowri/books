        <h1>Chapter 334 Breakthrough</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process of power growing from 325 feet to one hundred yards became extremely slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the help of the blood diamonds, Osborne felt it was difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so strenuous to get a breakthrough of Class B+, and the process will be prolonged to half or one month without the blood diamonds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To transfer from Class B+ to Class A, it's a dozen times harder than now, and even the most outstanding genius may fail to break through and end up dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out of a hundred metahuman of Class B+, only one can successfully become a Class A master. Ninety of them will die directly, and the remaining nine neither break through successfully nor die, and become Class A-," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Class A master was considered as an absolute man of might in the world. Those who could surpass Class A were rare, and each of them was a hegemony in a certain area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, the Godfather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather is a Class A+ master, also known as Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Masters of Class S would administrate </span><span>an</span><span> wide area but stay neutral of its peace or war. However, once they decided to interfere, there would be something shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was still very far away from being a Class S master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, his power didn't reach Class B+. He was just thinking about those things casually while waiting for the transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, when the night faded away and the fiery red sun reappeared in the sky, Osborne finally felt that his soul of powers had reached a hundred yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a critical point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just after exceeding a hundred yards, Osborne's soul of powers immediately began to transform. The huge phantom began to fluctuate, becoming more and more condensed, as if it was about to transform from an illusion into an entity, and every detail became clearer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silver light in the eyes of his soul of powers became more and more solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, his body shook, and he felt an extreme sense of pleasure that spread throughout his body and soul, feeling like it was a leap in the level of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that he had finally become a Class B+ metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his Satan's Eye became stronger, all of his power would become more powerful, and his control over energy would become easier and more precise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was very happy as he felt the changes in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he suddenly thought of Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa was the </span><span>first Class</span><span> A master he had ever seen. She was also the most powerful </span><span>metahuman Osborne had ever fought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was easily suppressed by Serena, it could still not impair the influence of her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, Osborne once knew that he definitely couldn't defeat Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he broke through to be a Class B+ metahuman, Osborne thought even if he encountered her again, he wouldn't lose again, even if he couldn't kill her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Osborne now truly possessed the strength to fight against an ordinary Class A master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, when facing several Class A metahumans, he wouldn't be terrified and could also retreat safely and soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Very good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finally broke through, having the strength to confront Alexander of the Paltrow family and even defeat him! However, the prerequisite is that Alexander has not yet broken through to become a master of Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once a genius like Alexander breaks through, his strength will definitely be much stronger than that of an ordinary master. Right now, I can't compete with him yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne suppressed the excitement in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Becoming a Class B+ was still not enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to stop the Radcliffe family from marrying Clarissa to Alexander, he must defeat Alexander in the witness of everyone. It was said that Alexander was already trying to reach the realm of Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very likely to become a master of Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I still have to improve my strength. However, the process of upgrading my ability level from Class B+ to Class A is really too tough. Even a genius like Alexander took five years to be qualified to make the breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if I have the blood diamonds, it's important for me to match his level in such a short time. But Clarissa may be arranged to marry Alexander in a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One month is too short for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if I practice with all my might, it's simply unrealistic to make the breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, my focus from now on will be improving my physical fitness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body has already reached Class B+ and even far exceeds it. I am not inferior to the average Class A martial masters. With the help of the blood diamonds, I have a chance to increase my physical competence dramatically in a short period of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my physical competence, there is a great chance that I can break through to Class A within a month! By then, with my power, even if Alexander becomes a Class A master, I will be able to fight him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made a decision in his heart and began to focus on improving his physical power. All the unique energy in the blood diamonds was integrated into his body cells to transform and improve his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This process was extremely painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Clarissa, and to have the strength to fight against Alexander and even the entire Paltrow family, Osborne persisted despite the severe pain like being peeled off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His physical power improved rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, someone knocked on his door.</span></p></div>
