        <h1>Chapter 2169 Powerful Isa</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling voice suddenly echoed through the air, crisp and melodic, as if it were coming from all directions, making it impossible to pinpoint the speaker's location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky's expression hardened immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's talking? Show yourself if you've got the guts!" he barked, his bravado barely masking his unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" A snort followed, cutting through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Ricky and his companions felt the sky darken above them. They instinctively looked up, only to be met with the sight of an enormous, pitch-black temple materializing overhead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looming atop the obsidian-hued temple was the silhouette of a statuesque and ravishing woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Ricky's features contorted with a mix of shock and unease. His eyes narrowed ever as he strained to discern her identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that... the Sanctum of Night?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is the Sanctum of Night!" someone gasped, awe creeping into their voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!" The members of the Human Alliance erupted in excited cheers at the sight of the massive palace appearing in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the Sanctum of Night! It's finally here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that the God of Night has arrived?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be the God of Night! Only he can control the Sanctum of Night! We're saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Alliance shouted fervently, their faces flushed with a mix of admiration, respect, and hope. They longed to see the mighty God of Night emerge from the Sanctum, effortlessly dispatching Ricky, Tyrese, and the others, driving the Dark Deity Legion back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, their hopes were destined to be dashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night did not appear. Instead, it was Isa who stood atop the Sanctum of Night, her icy gaze fixed on Ricky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it you who just said you'd kill the God of Night?" she asked, her voice steady and unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky glared at Isa with a sneer. "And who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am Isa Bowin, the woman of the God of Night," she replied coolly, her confidence unshakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky raised an eyebrow, a mocking smile creeping onto his face. "Oh? So you're Isa? The one she called for help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured toward the God of Time with contempt. "She was just crying out for you, and look, you actually showed up! But tell me, do you really have what it takes to save her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled, a hint of amusement dancing in her eyes. "I can't save her. But I can wipe you all out..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arrogant!" Ricky scoffed, anger flaring in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to test that theory?" Isa shot back, stepping forward and leaving the confines of the Sanctum of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glided gracefully through the air, closing the distance between her and Ricky, Tyrese, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cast a glance at the God of Time, whose face was pale and strained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time was in a dire state, and she didn't want Isa to see her like this, but she also knew that without the God of Night, Isa was their only hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, she warned, "Be careful! He's an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King! The rest of them are all Ascension Seven warriors, from a sect called Mystic Sirius. They're all incredibly powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa merely smiled, unfazed, "Got it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning her attention back to Ricky, she continued, "Six Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King? One Ascension Eight? Is this really the best Lord Malevolence could muster? If it's just you lot, I'm going to be very disappointed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky's face flushed with anger. "You little brat, you think you can underestimate us? Just the seven of us could sweep across all of Celestara Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smirked, her expression dripping with disdain, "How laughable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she took another step forward and in the blink of an eye, she was right in front of Ricky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even react, her long, elegant leg shot out, delivering a swift kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, several of Ricky's Apex divine artifacts shattered, their defenses crumbling under the force of Isa's strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky was sent flying backward, blood spraying from his mouth as he crashed to the ground, utterly overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crashed hard into the ground, creating a massive crater that echoed through the silence that followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stood frozen, their eyes wide in disbelief as they glanced between Isa and the deep hole where Ricky had just been sent crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astonishment gripped them as they swallowed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky was an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the God of Time, wielding the River of Time as a whip, could barely fend off his attacks, always on the defensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, here was Isa, effortlessly kicking him away like he was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chorus of gasps filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese and his crew tensed up, their expressions a mix of shock and fear as they stared at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa wore a disdainful smile. "Is that it? You think you can kill my man? Pathetic! You're not even a fraction of his worth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, a furious roar erupted from the depths of the crater, and Ricky exploded out, his face twisted in rage as he charged at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You damned woman! How dare you insult me? I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky unleashed a terrifying wave of power, launching a relentless assault on Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa merely chuckled, her demeanor calm and collected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ricky's attack closed in, she raised her leg and kicked out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky's assault shattered instantly, and he was sent reeling backward, blood spraying from his mouth as he crashed back into the ground, deepening the already massive crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence reigned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around them stood in stunned silence, their faces pale as they gazed at the striking figure of the woman who had just dominated Ricky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once could be chalked up to luck or Ricky being unprepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But twice? That was a clear demonstration of power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky, an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King, was reduced to the status of a child in the face of Isa's might, effortlessly kicked away without a hint of resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese and the rest were freaked out big-time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the heck kind of strength is that? Since when did Celestara Planet have a human warrior this scary? Even the God of Night couldn't be much better, could he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even the God of Time bit her lip in frustration. Though she loathed to admit it, she recognized the vast gap in strength between herself and Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to go again?" Isa asked, her gaze fixed on the crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a high probability that Ricky had succumbed to unconsciousness. Consequently, no one was available to offer a response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa laughed coldly, turning her attention to Tyrese and his companions. "So, are you going to step in? Or are you going to call for someone stronger? Because if it's just you lot, I'll have no trouble taking you down! Unless you've got something better up your sleeves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't, then bring out Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese and the others exchanged glances, their expressions darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like we misjudged the situation. We didn't expect a warrior like you to be hiding in the Human Community of Celestara Planet! Just the four of us can't handle you, but you should know this&mdash;your Human Community is still doomed! Even you can't save them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tyrese and his group bowed in unison toward a distant point. "Mr. Maddox Corenswet, we can't deal with this woman. We ask for your assistance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they finished, a chilling voice echoed back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! You good-for-nothing losers! You can't even take down one woman and you </span><span>need me to</span><span> step in? What the hell are you good for?"</span></p></div>
