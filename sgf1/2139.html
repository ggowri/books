        <h1>Chapter 2128 The Transformation of Satan's Eye</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, a triumphant grin plastered across his face, "My plan is working perfectly! With ten million Dark </span><span>Undeads</span><span> spread across the Corrosive Marsh, the Mud Golems will definitely sense the commotion and come out to play.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once they show up, I can pinpoint their locations and send in my Spatial Clones to take them down! Sure, Mud Golems are tough, but my Spatial Clones are just what I need to counter them. Taking them out will be a piece of cake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was practically glowing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While others feared encountering the dangerous Mud Golems in the Corrosive Marsh and wished for their numbers to dwindle, Osborne was hoping for the exact opposite. The more Mud Golems that appeared, the better for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, each Mud Golem he defeated would yield one Azure Ore and two Radiant Golden Ores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just half a day, he had already taken down over two hundred Mud Golems, netting him more than two hundred Azure Ores and close to five hundred Radiant Golden Ores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm hitting the jackpot!" Osborne couldn't contain his exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had lost a fair number of Dark Undead and Spatial Clones along the way&mdash;thanks to the lurking dangers of the Corrosive Marsh, which included not just Mud Golems but also corrosive bubbles&mdash;he didn't mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Dark Undead and Spatial Clones could be summoned again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their deaths were of no concern to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could just keep summoning more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Floating in front of him was a massive, pale gold eye&mdash;the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had consumed all the nearly five hundred Radiant Golden Ores, and Osborne's Satan's Eye pulsed violently, each throb making it stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still not enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For Satan's Eye to evolve to Sacredness Level, I need even more Radiant Golden Ores!" Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, he had thought the Corrosive Marsh was too vast, but now he worried it might not be vast enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He feared that before his Satan's Eye could complete its transformation, all the Mud Golems would be wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, his Spatial Clones and Dark Undead hadn't yet reached the edge of the </span><span>Corrosive Marsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep killing! Keep bringing me more Radiant Golden Ores! And don't forget, Azure Ores are useful too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a moment to spare, Osborne retrieved his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped a piece of Sacred Power around an Azure Ore, breaking down its energy and melding it into the bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, not only will my Satan's Eye evolve to Sacredness Level, but my </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow will transform into a Sacred Artifact as well!" His eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been in Umbra Earth for over twenty days now, and there were </span><span>fewer</span><span> </span><span>than ten days left until Umbra Earth would leave deep space and return to Umbra World.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been almost a month since Osborne left </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, </span><span>Celestara</span><span> was likely unaware of the brewing storm. Perhaps the Dark Deity Legion and the Human Community were already locked in a full-scale war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't return just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, going back would be futile; he would stand no chance against Lord Malevolence and wouldn't be able to change the balance of power in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, he needed to make the most of the remaining days in Umbra Earth to boost his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given the current situation, reaching Ascension Four within ten days seems impossible! But if Satan's Eye can break through to the Sacredness Level, the Infinite Devouring Eyes will become even more powerful, speeding up energy absorption. Then I might just have a shot at Ascension Four in time!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if my </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow can also transform into a Sacred Artifact, then I might actually stand a chance against Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne threw himself into his work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millions of Dark </span><span>Undeads</span><span> spread out across the Corrosive Marsh, acting as bait, while over two hundred Spatial Clones moved in as soon as they detected the Mud Golems, swiftly dispatching them and stashing the Azure Ores and Radiant Golden Ores into Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had nothing left to do but draw Azure Ores and Radiant Golden Ores from his Dimensional Space, focusing solely on enhancing his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow and Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days passed in this manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During that time, his Spatial Clones had taken down over two thousand Mud Golems, collecting more than two thousand Azure Ores and exceeding four thousand Radiant Golden Ores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the Infinite Devouring Eyes had absorbed all those Radiant Golden Ores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It now radiated a brilliant golden light, resembling a jewel made of pure gold, with a faint purple glow surrounding it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying pressure emanated from the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Osborne's Satan's Eye pulsating wildly, but the Infinite Devouring Eyes </span><span>were also throbbing in rhythm, producing a sound like distant drums.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious, a mix of anticipation and excitement flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed that after consuming those four thousand Radiant Golden Ores, Satan's Eye had finally reached a critical threshold, meeting the conditions for transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pulsing of Satan's Eye quickened even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a regal purple light burst forth from Satan's Eye, shooting out to envelop the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the golden Infinite Devouring Eyes shrank rapidly, merging into Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Infinite Devouring Eyes... are gone!" Osborne's face paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Infinite Devouring Eyes had been immensely valuable, capable of absorbing energy from everything around him to help boost his cultivation level. If it disappeared, he would have to spend time absorbing energy himself, inevitably slowing his progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, Osborne relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could still feel the energy flowing into his body, aiding his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "It's merging! Satan's Eye must have absorbed the Infinite Devouring Eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Infinite Devouring Eyes were essentially a manifestation of Satan's Eye! Now that Satan's Eye is evolving, it's reclaiming that power to facilitate its transformation! The abilities of the Infinite Devouring Eyes haven't vanished; they've simply integrated into Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, I can use Satan's Eye to absorb energy directly, accelerating my cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne felt the changes coursing through Satan's Eye, his excitement grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered just how powerful a Sacredness Level Satan's Eye would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the pulsations of Satan's Eye reached their peak, then abruptly stopped. Everything around him froze in time and space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, everything was still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye erupted with a surge of purple energy, which formed an intricate pattern in the sky, exuding a divine aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne's body trembled violently as an intense pain shot through his left eye, radiating throughout his entire being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" he cried out in agony, clenching his fists tightly to endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the transformation of Satan's Eye beginning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This metamorphosis was more intense than any previous upgrade he had experienced. In that fleeting moment, he sensed a unique power manifesting within Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Satan's Eye began to pulse again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its once eerie dual pupils shifted to one gold and one silver, surrounded by a sea of twinkling stars that sparkled with purple light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt a wave of relief wash over him, a profound sense of joy spreading through his entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew it&mdash;Satan's Eye had successfully transformed!</span></p></div>
