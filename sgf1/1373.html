        <h1>Chapter 1372 The Enormous Root</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it getting dark?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze, instinctively looking up. His eyes widened in shock as he took in the sight above him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At some point, an enormous root had emerged from the spatial void overhead, twisting and turning like a massive serpent, its gnarled form writhing ominously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is that?!" he exclaimed, unable to contain his disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The root was colossal, so far above them that it felt as if an entire mountain range loomed over their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its diameter must have exceeded six miles, perhaps even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its length stretched for thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of miles, extending far beyond what Osborne could see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer scale was mind-boggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he sensed the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity grow even more terrified. It unleashed a surge of power into Osborne's Divine Body, propelling him forward at an alarming speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, no matter how fast they moved, they couldn't escape the shadow of that enormous root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a terrifying crack, the root lashed out like a whip, aimed straight at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even before it got close, he felt a wave of lethal energy wash over him, a suffocating sense of impending doom gripping his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a gut feeling that if that root struck him, even his Divine Body&mdash;if it were ten or a hundred times stronger&mdash;would shatter into oblivion, leaving no trace behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even the resurrection abilities of the Lotus could bring him back from such a fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! Get out of here!" Osborne screamed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't need to shout; the Lotus was already reacting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as it sensed the root's impending strike, it surged with renewed energy, desperately trying to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The root struck down with a thunderous roar, shaking the entire space. As it approached, Osborne was stunned by just how fast it moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed was so blinding he could barely comprehend it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the Lotus was in control of his body, and they were moving swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a narrow escape, Osborne dodged the root's strike, but the force of the near miss </span><span>sent shockwaves through his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood erupted from his mouth as he felt his insides quake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel himself on the verge of breaking apart. His complexion turned pale, and he was severely injured, yet there was no time to stop. The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was too frantic to even attempt a healing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The root, frustrated by its missed target, lashed out again, this time even faster than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could sense the Lotus' fear intensifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After having drained it of several core energies, it was already weakened, its petals drawn in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they flared open once more, unleashing all its might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deft maneuver, the Lotus guided Osborne away from the massive root's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this only seemed to infuriate the root further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It thrashed violently, causing a terrifying spatial tide to ripple through the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in the blink of an eye, the void erupted with dozens of deep, gaping holes, each one spewing forth another colossal root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, dozens of enormous roots surrounded Osborne, closing in on him from all sides!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, despair clouded Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity seemed to radiate an aura of hopelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is this thing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this really another kind of Cosmic Treasure? What does it want?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it trying to devour the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What do I do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was deathly pale as he found himself surrounded by those monstrous roots&mdash;each one capable of crushing his Divine Body a hundred times, a thousand times, even ten thousand times over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but feel that even the Lotus might not be able to bring him back this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were completely engulfed, trapped by dozens of colossal roots!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every inch of spatial terrain around him was obscured by the looming tendrils. Even with the Lotus controlling his movements, there was nowhere to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the full weight of despair settled in, suffocating him as he fixed his gaze on those terrifying roots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are they? Why are they so menacing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The threat he faced now felt far worse than the earlier encounters with the spatial tide, where even death had held a semblance of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity could always revive him from that fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne was convinced that if these roots claimed his life, there would be no power left in the Lotus to resurrect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this it? Am I really going to die here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair washed over him like a cold tide, but before he could process his thoughts further, the roots stirred with a collective intent.</span></p></div>
