        <h1>Chapter 2288 The Four Pinnacle Powerhouses-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the ruckus in the crowd, Osborne quickly turned his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top ten on the state duel strength leaderboard were all forces to be reckoned with. Some boasted powerful ancient bloodlines, others had mastered several Sacred Artifacts to perfection, and still, others had combat skills that far outshone their peers. Each of them had their own unique edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the top four were truly in a league of their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all managed to fuse three types of power ahead of the game, which meant their Sacred Power was leagues stronger than anyone else's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Benson was one of those four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also intrigued by Benson. In his view, the only ones in the state duel who could really give him a run for his money were these four who, like him, had already fused three types of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne caught sight of Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson came from the First-rate Power, the Resurgent Throne Palace. He was a prodigy of the Flame Phoenix Clan. Osborne's Satan's Eye scanned over Benson, and right away, he detected an incredibly terrifying power within Benson's body. It was like magma on the verge of erupting from a volcano&mdash;searing hot and domineering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, this power transformed again, turning ice-cold and bone-chilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was utterly taken aback.</span><br><span>Is this... the fusion of fire and ice elemental power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">On top of that, he must have also fused a dense and stable power! It's gotta be his divine power! His divine power is so thick and potent that he can merge two mutually exclusive forces together!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This fusion could yield some unexpected results!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This Benson is one tough cookie!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like Osborne, Benson had fused three types of power, and the intensity of his Sacred Power was no slouch compared to Osborne's. However, Benson's cultivation level had already reached the peak of Ascension Ten, a notch higher than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, it was just the difference of one cultivation level, but still, it counted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne could also detect at least two distinct auras of Sacred Power emanating from Benson's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recognized those were Sacred Artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson had mastered at least two different Sacred Artifacts, which would give a massive boost to his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No wonder the strength leaderboard says Benson is a one-man army. Even if he goes it alone, he can easily land a spot in the top ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's really something! With that kind of power, he doesn't need a team at all. Even if Conrad's five-man team ganged up on him, they'd probably be no match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was sizing up Benson, and everyone around him was doing the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But out of the blue, in this situation, Benson suddenly turned his gaze towards Osborne, his brow wrinkling just a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson couldn't have cared less about the stares around him. After all, he was used to being in the spotlight wherever he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, he'd faintly felt a really chilling gaze, as if it could see straight through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instantly followed that strange feeling and spotted Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's energy signature didn't give him the slightest sense of threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Weird, could I have been imagining things?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson didn't give it much thought. After all, before coming here, he'd already marked Agatha, Horace, and Broderick&mdash;those ranked higher than him&mdash;as his only real competitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the rest, he didn't even consider them worth his attention!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strolled to the front, crossed his arms, shut his eyes, and patiently waited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, Benson's energy signature is off the charts!" the onlookers murmured among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Conrad's team quieted down significantly, their faces solemn as they stared in Benson's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how cocky Conrad was, he knew he didn't stand a chance against Benson in a one-on-one showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, even with his four top-100 teammates by his side, they might still come up short against Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyhow, Conrad's goal was just to make it into the top ten.</span><br><span>We gotta steer clear of him in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the top four spots were pretty much locked in, there were still six slots up for grabs, and he felt confident he had a shot.</span></p></div>
