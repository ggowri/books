        <h1>Chapter 1551 Transformation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darren's agreement didn't catch Osborne off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, he didn't need their consent to forcibly transform them into Blood Clan members; their divine power essence had shattered, leaving them as mere shells of their former selves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne decided to proceed with the transformation, they wouldn't be able to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, he chose not to take that path. He wanted to give them the choice, recognizing that they were not enemies. Whether or not to become Blood Clan members was their right as independent individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, if they opted out, Osborne wouldn't be able to heal their injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only by transforming them into Blood Clan members could the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity take hold in their bodies, allowing for a complete restoration of their shattered forms and heavy wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, his voice steady, "Alright! Why don't you talk it over with your men? If they're all on board, meet me in the training ground. I'll come by shortly to attempt your treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, sir!" Darren replied, excitement evident in his voice as he hurried off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Osborne arrived at the training ground, where 52 hundred figures stood in quiet anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as they spotted him, their eyes lit up with excitement and hope, a stark contrast to the despair that had clouded their faces just days before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They finally saw a glimmer of a chance to regain their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift!" they shouted in unison, their voices filled with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waved his hand and spoke, "Darren should have filled you in on the details. Since you're all here, I take it you've made your decision. I won't waste any more time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm about to transform your bodies, heal your injuries, and restore your powers. This process might be a bit painful, so brace yourselves and hold on tight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd of 52 hundred responded eagerly, some even with tears welling in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What was physical pain compared to the agony they had endured?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since their defeat in the West Zone, they had become powerless, stripped of hope, and reduced to slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mental torment they had suffered was far worse than any physical suffering they might face now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a flicker of hope reignited, they welcomed the prospect of enduring a little pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasted no time. Blood began to flow from his body, splitting into over five thousand droplets that swiftly darted toward each individual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the blood merged with their very essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The transformation commenced, and muffled groans filled the air. Many felt the sharp sting of pain coursing through them, but they held back their cries. Clenching their fists, they bore the agony in silence, even as their faces twisted in discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne surveyed the scene with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These 52 hundred individuals were the elite of an organization called the Pioneers of Starlight from the West Zone. They had faced a million-strong Dark Deity Legion, standing their ground until every last one of them had fallen, never once begging for mercy, even in captivity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These were true warriors forged in the fires of battle and rising from the ashes of slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they could all regain their strength, they would unleash a formidable power capable of challenging even the mightiest forces among the hundred clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, Darren had once held the title of Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number of powerful beings at the Celestial Deity level exceeded a hundred, while most of the others were also Transcendent Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With such a formidable group, once their injuries were healed, Spark of Blaze would transform into a major power within the Human Community. In fact, they could surpass the Swift family, currently considered the strongest force in Wild Flame City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With them on his side, Spark of Blaze would easily establish a foothold in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This would allow Osborne to focus his energies elsewhere without having to worry about Spark of Blaze being wiped out by rivals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Reflecting on this, Osborne felt a flicker of hope bloom within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I hope the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity can heal their wounds and restore their strength," he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, someone among the transformed individuals completed their transition into the Blood Clan. Although they appeared unchanged physically, the fervor and loyalty in their eyes as they gazed at Osborne were unmistakably deeper than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Darren, too, finished his transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One by one, they saluted Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My Lord!" they proclaimed, their voices a unison of devotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised a hand. "Get up! Transforming you into Blood Clan is just the first step. The real work starts now&mdash;it's time for your healing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne summoned the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A low hum reverberated through the air as tendrils of vibrant energy sprang from his being, swiftly piercing into the bodies of Darren and the other 52 hundred individuals, spreading and growing like roots in fertile soil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that instant, Osborne felt a profound connection to them, a bond that drew them closer together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he wished, he could tap into their power in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, for now, Darren and the others remained in a weakened state, completely drained of strength after their injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and declared, "Let the healing commence! Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, restore them completely!"</span></p></div>
