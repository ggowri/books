        <h1>Chapter 2230 Shocked Crowd-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hush fell over the arena like a thick blanket, a strange calm that took everyone by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lively buzz around the stage turned into a collective gasp as onlookers gaped at Diana. She'd easily taken a hit from the Wooden Golem and, in a split-second, sent it crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One punch&mdash;that was all it took.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, the once-fearsome Wooden Golem now seemed like a total pushover in front of Diana, more like a figment of the imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what seemed like ages, the chatter started up again, getting louder and more excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something </span><span>ain't</span><span> right! How could the Wooden Golem be this </span><span>weak</span><span>? These things have been used for training loads of times. You just fork out some Celestial Crystals, and they're good to go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, a bunch of inner disciples have used them. They've really struggled, and couldn't withstand the Golem's attacks, let alone break through its defenses. And now, this? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the three guys in Terrance's group looked really glum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get another Wooden Golem! This one's </span><span>gotta</span><span> be a dud!" Terrance ground his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamaal nodded in agreement. "It might seem okay on the outside, but there's definitely something screwy with its programming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I grabbed three Golems from the warehouse this time. Each one was from Ms. Olsen's first batch. They're supposed to be way tougher than the rest! I just can't believe all three are acting up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fired up, Jamaal took off running towards the arena, set on swapping out the faulty Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look! Jamaal's swapping the Wooden Golem! I said before that the last one had to be busted! How else could some hick from a small life-bearing planet take it down with one punch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bet! There had to be a problem! With the new Golem, there's no way they'll pull that off again. This time, they're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd murmured with wild guesses, Terrance started to feel a bit more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Maddox couldn't hold back and let out a scoff. After seeing what Bryce and Diana were capable of, he was brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Check it out! Anyone who's pals with Osborne </span><span style="font-style: italic;">is</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> bound to be a powerhouse, not your run-of-the-mill folks! I was worried they wouldn't pass the assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox shot a look at Terrance and said, "So you think the Wooden Golem's the problem? That's a riot! Just wait till you see how stupid you look later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance's face clouded over. "Hmph! What's so funny? Just you wait! Things won't be a walk in the park for you guys from now on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox said, brushing it off, "Really? We'll just have to see! I can't wait to wipe that smug look off your face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone stepped onto the stage&mdash;it was Hannah!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah, also at Ascension Three, got into position. The Wooden Golem sized her up and then launched a full-on attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying a word, Hannah tapped into her powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone who could wield both life and dark powers, she decided to go with her dark power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The new Wooden Golem went flying again and hit the ground hard, unable to get back up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah stepped out of the ring without a peep, her awesomeness low-key but undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now they knew how strong the Golems really were. Even though their powers outshone those of the top talents from the Paramount Supreme Clan at the same cultivation level, these Golems were still a tough nut to crack, and losing was a real risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with their already huge abilities given an extra boost by the Element Gold Crystal and Sacred Crystal, they'd come to see that the Golems were no match for them.</span></p></div>
