        <h1>Chapter 2280 Strength Boost-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, nearly all the contestants in the state duel had caught a glimpse of the state duel power rankings. Some nodded in agreement, while others scowled in discontent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, the unveiling of these rankings had given them a rough idea of who their opponents were, so they weren't going into the duel completely blind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A good number of them were champing at the bit, eager to strut their stuff in the state duel and make a splash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even more were already busy schmoozing, using the rankings as a guide to find potential allies for a short-term alliance in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lacked the strength to go it alone, so their only shot at a good outcome in the state duel was to band together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real heavy-hitters, the ones at the very top of the state duel power rankings, like Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson, sneered at the thought of teaming up with others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were so powerful that they were a force unto themselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was in seclusion and had no idea about the state duel power rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he did, he wouldn't give it a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength had come a long way since the city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Finally, it's fully integrated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes, his eyes alight with excitement. Guided by Adriana, he'd started to blend thunder power into his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he'd finally pulled it off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could keenly feel that his Sacred Power had reached new heights of profundity and might. It wasn't a mere arithmetic addition where the result was predictable. Instead, it was as if the combination of different forces had sparked a synergy, creating an effect that far exceeded the sum of its parts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Blending three powers, not too shabby, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm probably ten times stronger than when I took part in the city duel! After all, I've reached the Ascension Nine cultivation level, and my Sacred Power has also taken a leap forward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I were to cross paths with Leroy again... even if she fully mastered the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance and didn't get backfired or lose control... I could take her down with ease!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">One arrow would do the trick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile spread across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">However, Leroy has a Sacred Artifact. I'm afraid a lot of other contestants in the state duel will have them too! The Bloodwrought Bow is starting to show its age...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Thankfully, the Bloodwrought Bow can absorb Azure Ore once more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">For the next little while, I'll integrate all the Azure Ore into the Bloodwrought Bow and let it transform into a Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having made up his mind, Osborne wasted no time and got down to business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started to use his Sacred Power to melt the Azure Ore one by one and infuse it into the Bloodwrought Bow. Thanks to the enhancement of his Sacred Power, he could melt the Azure Ore at a much quicker pace. In just three days, he'd managed to fully integrate nearly a thousand pieces of Azure Ore into the bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right away, the Bloodwrought Bow began to undergo a transformation. An otherworldly, blood-red glow erupted from it, and a terrifying power started to take shape within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That power was none other than Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After soaking up the energy from over two thousand pieces of Azure Ore, the Bloodwrought Bow finally reached its peak strength. It was on the verge of a complete metamorphosis and was about to become a Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clasped the Bloodwrought Bow tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he felt an intimate connection, as if the bow was an extension of his very being. A mighty force radiated from the bow and coursed through his body, filling him with such power that he felt he could pierce the sky with a single arrow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn, it's so powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A Sacred Artifact truly outshines a quasi-Sacred Artifact! With the Sacred Artifact Bloodwrought Bow in my hands, my odds of shining in the state duel have just skyrocketed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Too bad the dark, spatial, and lightning elemental essences still haven't hit the Level Ten Peak. If they had, I'd be an absolute force to be reckoned with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's nearly time to head to the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A steely determination flashed across Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alright, it's time to break this seclusion. After the state duel, I've got three months to recharge before the zone duel kicks off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">By then, I've got to integrate the fourth power. And I'll make sure all the elemental essences I'm working on reach the Level Ten Peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne wrapped up his seclusion and stepped out of his dwelling.</span></p></div>
