        <h1>Chapter 1549 Back</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, grateful for Hannah's concern but resolute in his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that while the Gellar family could come to his aid once or twice, their support wouldn't be sustainable. The Keynes and Wolfe families might be deterred by the Gellar family's power for the moment, but they could easily retreat to the shadows, plotting his downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That could lead to even greater trouble down the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, relying on the Gellar family would mean incurring a debt of gratitude&mdash;one that could haunt him later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if Hannah asked him to marry into her family? He wouldn't be able to flat-out refuse, and that could complicate matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew if he truly wanted to establish himself in Wild Flame City, he had to rely on his own strength. Only through his own prowess could he forge a lasting reputation that would genuinely deter enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, it was just the Wolfe family and the Keynes family they were dealing with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the factions in Wild Flame City, the Wild Bull Clan and the Crimson </span><span>Ironhoof</span><span> Clan were not the weakest, but they were not far off. The Wolfe family and the Keynes family weren't particularly strong either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, neither the Wolfe family nor the Keynes family had a Deity King warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne couldn't handle them, how could he ever hope to lead Spark of Blaze in Wild Flame City or change the East Zone Human Community's situation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this resolution, a fierce determination ignited within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, they dare to attack Spark Estate? If they want a fight, I'll give them one! Their blood will serve as a warning for the other factions in Wild Flame City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought hanging in the air, Osborne no longer sought to discuss the issue further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he and Hannah weren't using a Malevolence Airship, they raced towards Wild Flame City, arriving in no time at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they neared Spark Estate, a tense sight met Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The perimeter was swarming with members of the Wolfe and Keynes families, their attacks bombarding the estate's divine power shield, sending ripples through its surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still at it?" Osborne scoffed, but he didn't rush into the fray just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, you should head back. This mess is between me and the Wolfe and Keynes families. You don't need to get involved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah bit her lip, her concern palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do we really need to draw such a clear line? We're friends now, aren't we? Helping friends is what you do! You don't need to worry about dragging me into this mess; you know I can handle myself. No one will figure out who I really am."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at her with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you! I won't forget it, but really, I can handle this on my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah hesitated, her brow furrowing. "You really think you can take them on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Wolfe and Keynes families may not be as strong as the Swift family, but they have two genuine Deity Overlord warriors among them, plus quite a few </span><span>Celestial</span><span> Deity-level warriors. Are you sure you can deal with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile, "Don't worry, I've got this! If I can't handle the Wolfe family and the Keynes family, then what hope do I have? Besides, I'm not alone in this fight. I have the support of Spark of Blaze. If Spark of Blaze can't handle the Wolfe family and the Keynes family, how can we even hope to maintain their footing in Wild Flame City?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So just watch from the sidelines. If things get truly dire, then you can step in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's expression shifted to resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! I'll be nearby. But if you need help, you have to call me! We're friends, so don't hesitate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal!" Osborne replied, relief washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some back and forth, he finally convinced Hannah to head back, turning his full attention to the attackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait! I'll take care of you soon enough!" Osborne </span><span>declared,</span><span> his voice laced with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he reached out to contact Betty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she was busy replenishing the Essence Crystals powering the estate's divine power shield, ensuring it held against any further attacks. When she saw Osborne's message come through, her face lit up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift! You're finally back!" Betty exclaimed, quickly opening a small portal in the divine power shield to let him in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time at all, word of Osborne's return spread throughout Spark of Blaze, and his team hurried over to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded to them, concern flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone alright?" he asked, scanning their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all nodded in unison, relief washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty spoke up, her expression a mixture of happiness and worry, "Mr. Lachlan Swift, the divine power shield has held up remarkably well. Even with two Deity Overlord warriors attacking together, it hasn't broken! We're all fine, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated, glancing at the pile of Essence Crystals, her brow furrowed in distress. "We've burned through a massive amount of Essence Crystals. We're really feeling the strain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Betty spoke, her concern deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shielding spell relied heavily on consuming Essence Crystals to function, and if Osborne hadn't left them two million mid-grade Essence Crystals, they might have been overwhelmed long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just over two days of consistent attacks, they had spent a staggering 100 thousand mid-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's heart ached at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, wore a calm smile that suggested this was no big deal to him. "A hefty amount, you say? For me, that's hardly a concern."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His confidence was infectious. After all, he had just returned from the No. 13 mining area with an abundance of Essence Crystals.</span></p></div>
