        <h1>Chapter 2228 Special Wooden Golem-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So why don't you just slink off and save yourself the embarrassment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a practical assessment, isn't it? We'll take part."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance's face contorted with disdain. "Is that your way of chickening out? How utterly pitiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd burst into laughter, ridiculing Osborne for seemingly being too scared to take on Terrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready for the practical assessment," Terrance snapped, not wanting to waste another second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, as an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King and the fourth-ranked inner disciple of Peak Seven, it was beneath him to keep haggling with a newbie like Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the idea of Osborne and his friends entering the assessment brought a cold smirk back to his face. Terrance couldn't wait to see how they'd fare against the Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just wait these guys make complete idiots of themselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You think you can ace the practical assessment? Beat a Wooden Golem at the same cultivation level? Please! I'd be shocked if any of you could pull that off. And here's the kicker&mdash;My teacher is in charge of those Wooden Golems. He knows there's a batch that's off-the-charts powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those Wooden Golems were the very first ones made by Peak Lord Ms. Olsen! Each one of them is way stronger than the others. Even I'd have a tough time going up against that batch at the same cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just wait till these fools get flattened by the Golems! Maddox thinks he can get them into </span><span style="font-style: italic;">the </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Mystic Sirius Sect, specifically Peak Seven? That's hilarious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Terrance shot a look at the guy behind him and quickly sent a mental message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jamaal, you take care of the Wooden Golems yourself. Fetch that special batch..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamaal's eyes sparkled with excitement at the order and he scurried off without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they reached a huge arena where the Wooden Golems were all set up, raring to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news had spread like wildfire, and thousands of onlookers flocked to the scene, itching to see the newbies take on the fearsome Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance, Brie, and Jamaal were standing on the sidelines, their eyes twinkling with amusement as they watched Osborne and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be the first?" Maddox looked at Osborne, his face full of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne just flashed a calm and composed smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Bryce stepped forward. "I'll lead the way! I'm the weakest among us, so let me go up there and size up these Wooden Golems. If I can't make it through, I'll just strike out on my own adventure..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a big grin, Bryce sauntered into the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his self-deprecating words, he practically oozed confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Going up against a Wooden Golem at the same cultivation level? Bryce couldn't have cared less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The training they'd done in Hope Haven, fueled by a generous supply of Element Gold Crystals and Sacred Crystals, had taken their strength to a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he reached Ascension Three, but his elemental essence had also exceeded Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was fearless against a foe at the same cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Bryce stepped into the arena, his eyes met a motionless Wooden Golem in the distance. It was made of a kind of wood he couldn't name, but it had a metallic sheen and looked rock-solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox muttered, a tinge of uneasiness in his voice, "Hold on a sec... this Wooden Golem seems off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what's different about it? I can't quite put my finger on it, but it feels like someone's pulling the strings here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft laugh. "Don't sweat it! Let's just wait and see how things play out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also fixed his gaze on the Wooden Golem, his curiosity getting the better of him. He activated his Satan's Eye and took a peek inside the Golem. To his amazement, its internal mechanisms were incredibly elaborate, looking like something out of high-tech science.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, this is one well-made Golem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Peak Lord Ms. Olsen of Peak Seven must be a real master forger! This Wooden Golem is definitely a top-notch Apex divine artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was truly blown away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging also has methods for making Golems! Granted, it's about forging holy-level Golems, which would be even more complex and powerful than this one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've got to dig into that Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging as soon as I can!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts whizzed through his head, he shifted his focus back to the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let the fight start!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was a soft hum, and the Wooden Golem sprang into action, gearing up for the battle.</span></p></div>
