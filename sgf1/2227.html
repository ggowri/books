        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Maddox had transformed into a Blood Golem, he immediately complied with Osborne's inquiry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My lord, you're absolutely right. Taking the route through deep space to Elf City and then teleporting back to Racial Convergence Planet would indeed be much faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason we didn't choose to escape through deep space boils down to two main factors. First, we knew you possessed spatial power. If we tried to tear open a rift in deep space, we'd have to rely on brute force to break through the spatial barrier, which is a tall order for us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The spatial fluctuations generated would be incredibly intense, and you'd definitely catch wind of it. At that point, all you'd need to do is make a move, and we wouldn't even be able to enter deep space. Even if you were busy battling Zayne, Isa would certainly intercept us, and we'd be trapped!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we opted for a stealthy escape into the cosmos."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that if Maddox had chosen to flee through deep space, the resulting fluctuations would have been hard to miss. Even if he were engaged in combat, he could have thwarted their escape, and Isa would have ensured they didn't get away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why didn't you head into deep space once you were in the cosmos? By that point, you were already far from Celestara Planet. Even if there were strong spatial fluctuations, I wouldn't have sensed them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox let out a bitter chuckle. "My lord, once we entered the cosmos, our power was insufficient to forcibly tear through the spatial barrier and reach deep space!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm? Why's that?" Osborne raised an eyebrow, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox quickly explained, "My lord, the spatial barriers in the cosmos are far sturdier than those on any planet! On a planet, anyone with the strength of a Supernal Deity King can break through the barrier and enter deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But in the vacuum of the cosmos, even an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King would have a tough time tearing through the spatial barriers! Only an Empyrean Sacredness warrior could accomplish that in the cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, that doesn't include those who possess spatial power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback by this revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The spatial barriers in the cosmos are tougher?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to test it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, he conjured a dimensional rift in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was a mere thread of a rift, and it vanished almost immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of astonishment crossed Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The spatial barriers in the cosmos are indeed incredibly resilient! Even I find it challenging to tear through them here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's going on?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furrowing his brow, Osborne pondered why the dimensional barriers in the cosmos were so formidable that even his spatial power felt limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox, sensing his confusion, continued, "My lord, that's just how solid the spatial barriers are in the cosmos! And the closer you get to the center of the universe, the stronger they become!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Both Racial Convergence Planet and Celestara Planet are located at the universe's edge, which is why the barriers aren't as powerful there. On either of those planets, any Supernal Deity King can easily break through the spatial barriers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I've heard that in regions closer to the center of the universe, even an Empyrean Sacredness warrior can't budge the spatial barriers! They'd have to pay a hefty price just to enter deep space!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but be amazed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, the closer you get to the center of the universe, the tougher the spatial barriers? Not even an Empyrean Sacredness warrior can shake them? What's the reason behind that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My lord, it might have something to do with Arcane Energy and Dark Matter!" Maddox replied, his tone serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arcane Energy and Dark Matter?" Osborne echoed, his surprise evident. "What exactly are those?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox shook his head. "I wish I knew! Not just me&mdash;those Empyrean Sacredness warriors on Racial Convergence Planet don't have a clue either! If they did understand Arcane Energy, they'd have a shot at breaking through to an even higher level of existence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arcane Energy is tied to the breakthroughs of Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Dark Matter, it's said to be the most fundamental substance that makes up the universe. Both Arcane Energy and Dark Matter are everywhere in the cosmos. The difference is that at the center of the universe, they're incredibly dense, while at the edges, they're sparse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why the spatial barriers are so solid in the center of the universe and weaker at the edges! In fact, everything near the center is tougher than anything at the fringes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ordinary beings can't survive in the center of the universe! Only the most powerful races can dwell there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've even heard that warriors abound in the center, but even Empyrean Sacredness warriors can't fly normally on planets, let alone leave them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, that's just a legend; no one really knows </span><span>whether</span><span> it is</span><span> true</span><span>. Even on Racial Convergence Planet, no one has ever ventured to the center of the universe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Many Empyrean Sacredness warriors have tried, but they never returned!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's words left Osborne speechless, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In the center of the universe, Empyrean Sacredness warriors can't even fly normally on planets</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> or return</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's hard to believe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I mean, these are beings who could wipe out hundreds of millions with a single breath! They can shatter massive planets with a casual punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And yet, they can't even take to the skies?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne struggled to wrap his head around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, on Celestara Planet, even a Junior Deity could soar through the air with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Forget it. I shouldn't dwell on it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mysteries of the universe's center felt too far removed from his current reality. After all, he hadn't even visited other planets yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Maddox, Celestara Planet was just a small life-bearing world nestled close to Racial Convergence Planet. There were countless other tiny life planets in the vicinity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Racial Convergence Planet was the biggest and most dominant life planet in that region of space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors from Racial Convergence Planet had set up Cosmic Translocators on many planets within this cosmos. Through those Translocators, one could travel directly to Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox and his companions had their sights set on a life planet called Necoton Planet. With their speed, they could reach it in just three months and then use its Translocator to return to Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, a spark of interest in his eyes, "Necoton Planet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I've sorted things out on Celestara Planet, I should definitely use the Cosmic Translocator there to check out Racial Convergence Planet! I want to see what this most prosperous and massive life planet, teeming with warriors, is really like!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But for now, I need to tackle the problems here on Celestara Planet first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then there's the matter of the God of Night's memories</span><span>...</span><span>"</span></p></div>
