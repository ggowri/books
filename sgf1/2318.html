        <h1>Chapter 2265 Reveled in the Turmoil-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's expression soured as he processed Osborne's shocking words.</span><br><span>Did Osborne really just say he wants to buy me out in front of millions of spectators? Ten thousand Sacred Crystals? What a low blow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scoffed loudly. "Shameless! I've told you before, that you can try to buy anyone else, but you'll never buy me. A measly ten thousand Sacred Crystals? You think I'm that easy?" His disdain was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, continued to smile, unfazed. "Oh, not enough for you? No problem! How about I bump it up to a hundred thousand Sacred Crystals? All you have to do is play along a bit and let me win, and that fortune is yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's demeanor shifted, his fists tightening. His heart raced as he calculated the offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred thousand Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a small fortune&mdash;enough to buy ten quasi-Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was more than everything he had combined!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But looking at Osborne's smug grin, he knew this was just a game. With all these spectators watching, there was no way he could accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury flared within him. "You're asking for trouble! I told </span><span>you,</span><span> you can't buy me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile never wavered. "Still not enough? No sweat. I can keep upping the ante! But I get it, you're too shy to say yes in front of all these people. Let's have a little telepathic chat. I've got more than enough Sacred Crystals to spare. I'm dead-set on buying you over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's face darkened even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this point, Tyson couldn't help but imagine what Osborne might offer next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Two hundred thousand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Three hundred thousand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A million?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced even faster at the thought. If it really came down to a million, maybe he could play along and let Osborne win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a mind-blowing sum!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for a power like Azure Haven Academy or Fantasia Isle, a million Sacred Crystals was a monumental amount&mdash;enough to buy a real Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he waited for Osborne's next move, he felt his anticipation turn to irritation when no offer came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply grinned back at him. "Great! It's settled then! Just be sure to act well; if you don't put on a good show, I'll definitely hold back on the payment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne hoisted up his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's eyes popped wide open, and he was seething with anger. "What the hell are you on about? We've reached no agreement at all! I'm not falling for your little scheme!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, sure! No deal here, and we definitely don't want anyone getting a whiff of our 'chat'," Osborne said, his tone way too laid-back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, he let go of the string on his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bolt of Sacred Power whooshed through the air, heading straight for Tyson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what the heck?!" Tyson's heart sank when he saw it. There was no time for arguing. His survival instincts kicked in, and he tightened his grip on his fire spear, swinging it down to block the incoming bolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Smash it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson was convinced that his brute strength could effortlessly shatter the arrow. He relished head-on confrontations and wasn't daunted by Osborne's attack; he was fully prepared for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the blink of an eye, a rude awakening hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power behind Osborne's Sacred Power arrow was magnitudes greater than he'd ever imagined. When his spear clashed with the arrow, instead of smashing it to pieces, a massive rebound jolted through his body. A searing pain shot through his palm as he fought desperately to keep hold of his spear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his horror, Tyson saw the arrow still hurtling straight towards his chest, completely unstoppable.</span></p></div>
