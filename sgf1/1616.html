        <h1>Chapter 1615 Friend</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you say we're friends?" Diana bit her lip as she asked, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been sent to the Divine Peak Nine base since childhood, she had only encountered people who looked down on her, mocked her, or sought to exploit her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had never known family, let alone a friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had grown accustomed to this life, sealing off her heart and becoming indifferent, merely going through the motions of existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, just because of Osborne's simple word&mdash;"friend"&mdash;she felt as if a certain lock within her had shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched Osborne's back, she felt her eyes well up with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they had only met a couple of hours ago, his ordinary declaration made him shine in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, her once numb and cold heart felt warmth for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to see Diana's teary eyes and instantly understood what she was feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled gently, "Are we not friends now? Don't forget, we have our own 'signal'! We've talked for miles, and you've shared so much about yourself. When Riley gave me that unreasonable task, you stood up for me! You were worried about my safety and wanted to scout ahead. If you don't consider me a friend, I'd be heartbroken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened, and they reddened even more at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head vigorously. "No! No! Of course, I consider you a friend! I just... I thought you wouldn't want to be friends with someone like me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be silly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the panic and insecurity in Diana's eyes tugged at Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, if we don't get moving, Riley will accuse me of dragging my feet, and then I'll have an excuse for punishment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand and started deeper into the tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana bit her lip and hurried to keep up. Although Osborne </span><span>insisted</span><span> he didn't want friends risking their necks for him, she felt an instinctive need to stay close, her expression alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, she promised herself that if danger arose, she would step in front of Osborne without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Osborne was her friend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the only friend she had, and no matter what, she couldn't let him get hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the two of them ventured deeper into the dark tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About a mile behind them, Riley and the others watched, their faces twisted with mockery and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captain Raglan, thank you for this," Emmett said with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley </span><span>shrugged,</span><span> his tone indifferent. "No need to be so formal, Mr. Emmett Huntington. It's just a small favor! We're all part of the Soaring Lion Clan. Even if we're not from the same family, we rise and fall together! That lowly human has crossed the Huntington family, which means they've crossed me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since he's under my command, I'll make sure he suffers a bit. If they run into trouble, we shouldn't rush to help. If he dies, all the better; if he survives, I'll think of something else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett's smile widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, with you saying that, I'm at ease! That pathetic human is in for a rough time&mdash;if they don't die, it'll be a miracle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana whispered, "Osborne, be careful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every time we enter the extraction zone, we inevitably run into some issues. </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> might not need Essence Crystals, but they love to gather around places rich in them. We're only Celestial Deity level. If we encounter a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, we could be in serious trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, "Don't worry, I'll be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he activated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley and Emmett thought that by sending him ahead to scout, they could set him up for trouble, hoping he would encounter a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> and land himself in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did they know that Osborne had Satan's Eye at his disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the rocks and soil around Divine Peak Nine possessed unique energy shields, rendering them incredibly hard and dimming the effects of Osborne's ability, he could still see clearly into the depths of the dark tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> lurked within, he would be able to spot it from a distance without needing to approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne narrowed his eyes. After arriving at Divine Peak Nine, he finally encountered a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>!" he mused in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> were incredibly rare near Wild Flame City, and the first he came across here was indeed one of the most powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, this </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> was not like the others; it was lying in wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Osborne's gaze, the figure of the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> seemed aware of their approach, instantly camouflaging itself against the rocky wall of the cave, transforming into what looked like an ordinary boulder, except for its cold, piercing eyes that were the only things exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone wasn't paying attention, they would never notice it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> at the Deity Overlord level&mdash;and intelligent, no less! I can't even imagine how formidable it must be," Osborne muttered, urgently calling out to Diana.</span></p></div>
