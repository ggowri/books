        <h1>Chapter 2297 He's a Goner?-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo's jaw dropped so hard it might as well have hit the ground when he saw the leaderboard refresh. He gulped nervously, still in a state of utter shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a moment earlier, he'd been calling Osborne a dumbass for charging into the sixth layer. He was convinced there was no way Osborne could last more than a few minutes in there, let alone find a token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, out of the blue! Osborne's score skyrocketed by 100 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only one logical explanation&mdash;the moment Osborne stepped into the sixth layer, he just happened to stumble upon a token. He quickly registered it on his badge and scored a ton of state </span><span>duel</span><span> points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was how he shot straight up to second place, neck-and-neck with Broderick and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd in Frost Peak City, with their eyes glued to the leaderboard, let out a collective gasp and started buzzing with excitement. Most of them had never even heard of Osborne before. They were frantically scouring the strength rankings to find his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Discovering that he was way down at the 108th spot on the rankings only cranked up their surprise a notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there were only around twenty contestants who could really hold their own against the savage storms in the sixth layer and go token-hunting at will. Maybe fifty could tough it out for an hour or more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, ranked 108th, actually had the balls to enter the sixth layer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he found a token and bagged a neat 100 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Talk about crazy luck!" exclaimed one spectator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There </span><span>ain't</span><span> no cameras in the sixth layer, so we can't see what Osborne's up to. But he'll probably hightail it back to the fifth layer soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep your eyes peeled on the fifth-layer Translocator. We'll lay eyes on him before long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm itching to see what this guy looks like..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela and Danilo glanced at each other, not quite sure if they should be over the moon or what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, sitting pretty in second place, Osborne was bringing a whole heap of glory to the entire sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In all the previous state duels, no disciple from the Mystic Sirius Sect had ever made it this far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if this ranking was just a flash in the pan and was bound to be overtaken later, this was still an achievement that the Mystic Sirius Sect had never seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela said, a smile spreading across her face, "Well, I'll be damned! I always knew that kid had it in him to blow us away! Even if he doesn't score another single point, 100 thousand points should be enough to get him into the top hundred, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo nodded. "From what we've seen in the past, 100 thousand points should do the trick to land him in the top hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that's only if he can hang onto those points!" Danilo added, his tone turning grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first three days of the state duel were all about individual token-hunting and point-scoring. But the last four days were a free-for-all, where the contestants would go at each other like wild animals. On the final day, everyone had to head back to the first layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm for a no-holds-barred showdown, fighting tooth and nail for every last point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's sitting on 100 thousand points. He's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be a prime target. Everyone's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be gunning for him, trying to snatch those points right </span><span>outta</span><span> his hands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can't defend them, he'll just be fattening up someone else's score!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela nodded. "</span><span>Osborne'll</span><span> probably find more tokens and boost his score. But holding onto those points? That's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be an uphill battle. Luckily, contestants only lose a tenth of their points when they're beaten. </span><span>So</span><span> if he racks up enough points at the start, his final score won't be half-bad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as she said that, a spark of anticipation flashed in Angela's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! Back in the city duel in Tempest Fortress City, no one gave you a snowball's chance in hell of winning. But I had faith in you. I bet ten thousand Sacred Crystals on you! And this time, folks still </span><span>ain't</span><span> buying it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm hoping you can keep making them eat their words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Angela fixed her eyes firmly on the fifth-layer Translocator. She was dead certain that Osborne would pop out from the sixth layer any moment now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne set foot back on the fifth layer, the countless recording and projection devices would be all over him, capturing his every move and broadcasting it for the whole world to see.</span></p></div>
