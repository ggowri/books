        <h1>Chapter 1179 Cain's Scheme</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a decision crystallized in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, I'll focus on mastering spatial power and dark power. Light Power might seem stronger at first glance, but I just don't resonate with light elemental. My potential with it is limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark Power, however, feels like a better fit&mdash;it could take me to greater heights in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his mind made up, Osborne set his sights on utilizing the nine strands of core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to enhance his spatial and dark elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused for a moment, weighing the significance of his choice. After all, the core energy was invaluable; it might be a long time before he encountered anything of its caliber again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if he was wrong? If Osborne wasted this precious resource on dark elemental essence and found his judgment flawed, the setback would be monumental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But regret had no place in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having made his decision, he wasted no time in taking action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, however, Cain burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, congrats on forging your Divine Body and becoming a Junior Deity! But here's the kicker. You've created a Waste Divine Body! How utterly pathetic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I expected you'd be capable of a Level Five or even a Level Six Divine Body, but instead, you've ended up with this travesty. It seems like the core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity isn't fit for refining Divine Bone or Divine Flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Instead of elevating your level, it wrecked what was already a strong body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least it saved your life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without the Lotus, you'd be dead already. So hey, you're still kicking! A Waste Divine Body is still a body, right? The strength of one's prowess extends far beyond the physique!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arched an eyebrow. "You seriously think this is a Waste Divine Body? Are you certain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain replied, smirking, "Is there any doubt? Your Ethereal Glow is practically </span><span>transparent&mdash;classic proof of a Waste Divine Body! Never got that wrong before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in his fragmented state, Cain had once held the title of Deity Overlord warrior, and his experience and insight still lingered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Cain failed to see the uniqueness of Osborne's Divine Body and mistook it for a Waste Divine Body was a source of secret satisfaction for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fair enough, if it's a Waste Divine Body, then let it be! At least I'm alive! Besides, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is nearing the completion of its second phase of fusion with my Divine Body. I'll be on my way to gaining a form of immortality soon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And even if I have a Waste Divine Body, that's not the end of the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain, taken aback by Osborne's calmness, shook his head in disbelief. "You've got a good attitude; I'll give you that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But let me tell you something&mdash;the way you're using those nine strands of core energy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not how it's meant to be used! You messed up back there, and that's what turned your Divine Body into a Waste Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to be careful with it moving forward! Misuse it again, and you won't know what hit you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of confusion spread across Osborne's face. "So I shouldn't use it recklessly? What should I do instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's eyes glimmered with greed. "Well, here's the plan&mdash;just hold off for now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those strands of core energy are far too advanced for you at this moment. You can't handle their power just yet! Best to keep them on ice until you're stronger. Then you'll be able to use them to their full effect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold onto it for now?" Osborne muttered with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Cain wants me to keep the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity untouched, and it's definitely not for my benefit! He's probably afraid I might use it, leaving nothing for him to seize once he's out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looks like he's got a way to escape! And when he does, he'll definitely come after me&mdash;not just for the core energy but for the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity itself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes darkened with seriousness at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, Cain was once a Deity Overlord warrior. Once he breaks free, his strength will swiftly return! I doubt I'll stand a chance against him then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he'll surely kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I absolutely cannot let him escape! I need to find a way to take him out first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered rapidly, his face betraying none of his thoughts, feigning a look of indecision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given my current power, how can I possibly take him down? He was the former master of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity; the energy protects him. Unless I can surpass him in controlling the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, taking him out will be tough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wonder if using the Breath of Celestial might work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt it was worth a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But first, I need to wait until the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is fully integrated with my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain was a Deity Overlord; even with a fragmented soul, he might still hold some last-ditch survival cards. I need to be fully prepared to take him out&mdash;pushing my strength to the max before striking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'd better focus on enhancing my elemental essences for now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sorting through his thoughts, Osborne spoke up, "Thank you for the advice! But I've got my own plans! I've decided to use the nine core energies of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to enhance my elemental essences... My Divine Body is already a Waste Divine Body, if my elemental essences aren't strong enough, I'll truly be a lost cause!"</span></p></div>
