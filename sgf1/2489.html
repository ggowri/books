        <h1>Chapter 2392 Volcanic Area</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? This kid's interdimensional travel crossed millions of kilometers? The distance isn't too far, but he actually dared to use such a move in a completely unfamiliar and dangerous environment. Yet the place he emerged from was flat all around, with no danger at all. Is it just luck? Or is there another reason?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Judge No. 11, named Harriet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is a warrior with advanced Empyrean Sacredness. With his cultivation level, none of the participants in the zone duel are worth his attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is confident he can catch up with any participant, hiding in the shadows to observe without being noticed. Naturally, he can detect the spatial energy fluctuations left behind by Osborne's interdimensional travel and quickly catch up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, he found he couldn't catch up with Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's speed after using interdimensional travel was too fast. Even if he gave it his all to chase, he could only be left behind, while the spatial energy fluctuations left by Osborne grew fainter and fainter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This won't do! I'm Judge No. 11. If I get left behind by a kid who hasn't even attained Empyrean Sacredness, it would be too humiliating! Looks like I need to pick up the pace too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, a Sacred Artifact battleship appeared in front of Harriet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was a low-grade Sacred Artifact battleship, under his control, it chased after Osborne at an extremely high speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he felt he was getting closer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harriet's lips curled into a confident smile. "Kid, trying to shake me off? You're still too green! Next, let me secretly observe you and see what you're truly capable of! Betting nearly three million Sacred Crystals on yourself&mdash;I'll see if you really have profound strength or are just overly arrogant!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Harriet finally caught a distant glimpse of Osborne's figure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took out the recording device, ready to secretly capture everything and project it back to Crescentia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, he was shocked to find that Osborne suddenly turned his head and glanced in his direction, as if he had noticed him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harriet was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible! Maybe it's just a coincidence. I'm still so far from him and have concealed my presence. Not to mention just a kid who hasn't attained Empyrean Sacredness, even a warrior who has reached Empyrean Sacredness or obtained a </span><span>mid Sacred</span><span> Artifact couldn't possibly detect me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harriet looked confident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, he saw Osborne use interdimensional travel again, disappearing from his sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What shocked Harriet the most was that after Osborne disappeared this time, he couldn't sense any spatial fluctuation left behind. Without spatial fluctuation, he had no way to continue pursuing Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "How is that possible?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Did this kid really notice me? And he deliberately hid his power fluctuations? But how is that possible... How could he achieve this level? Has his control over power reached such a degree?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could it be that his spatial elemental essence has already reached the Sacredness Level? Impossible! He's just an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King and hasn't broken through to Empyrean Sacredness. His elemental essence couldn't possibly reach the Sacredness Level! Absolutely impossible!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But how did he suppress the spatial fluctuation?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harriet couldn't figure it out no matter how hard he tried. After a thorough investigation, he still found nothing and felt a bit lost.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lost Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook him off!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Harriet felt a bit embarrassed, he was even more astonished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No choice, he could only contact Gerald.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh? You got shaken off?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald was also shocked at this moment. Harriet, a warrior with advanced Empyrean Sacredness, being discovered while tracking a junior who hadn't even attained Empyrean Sacredness was already unbelievable, but to be shaken off by Osborne was even more so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Osborne is truly remarkable! Maybe he really can surprise us all in this zone duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Gerald said, "Harriet, come back. You don't need to bother with Osborne for now. I'll arrange for Judge No. 3 to track that kid! Judge No. 3 is best at tracking, no matter how he runs, it's useless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!" Harriet said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was already approaching the eastern volcanic region of Abyssal Planet. He could clearly feel the air around him becoming hot and murky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Volcanic ash had already shrouded the sky, making the already dark Abyssal Planet even darker.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stopped in place and turned to look behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I should have shaken off that judge secretly following me, right? Even though it's advanced Empyrean Sacredness, I suppressed my power, so he shouldn't be able to find me. I really don't want someone secretly watching me in the dark, projecting everything I do back for all the spectators to see..." Muttering to himself, Osborne looked toward the east.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The volcanic region is just ahead. The air is getting hotter... but it&rsquo;s nothing to me! After all, my flame elemental essence has already reached the Sacredness Level, and I&rsquo;ve ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame. Even soaking in volcanic magma wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne's body flickered again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, he appeared above a volcano, looking down at it from a high vantage point, fully activating Satan's Eye and scanning rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Dark Mandala, a specialty of Abyssal Planet, grows deep in the eastern volcanoes. A flower burning with purple-black flames, its petals covered in starry patterns, and highly poisonous. One Dark Mandala can be exchanged for a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne recalled the description on the list.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Satan's Eye scanned every corner of the volcano, even deep into the magma layers, quickly searching while matching the appearance of the Dark Mandala.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nothing. Inside this volcano, there's no resource or treasure, not even a Dark Mandala!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured and looked ahead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In front of him was a dense cluster of volcanoes, one after another, seemingly endless, numbering in the hundreds of thousands or even millions, some still erupting with scorching magma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Volcanic ash and smoke obscured everything ahead, even Osborne's Satan's Eye was limited in such a place, unable to see deeper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the deeper into the volcanic region, the </span><span>more dense</span><span> the volcanic ash, smoke, and scorching magma became, further limiting Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It seems I can only search each volcano. Dark Mandala is so valuable, one can be exchanged for a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, it must be extremely rare. I have a full ten days; if I move faster, I can at least search most of the volcanic region..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as the information is correct, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll gain a lot!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If even I can't find the Dark Mandala, then no one else stands a chance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne began searching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body flickered and appeared above the second volcano. Satan's Eye quickly scanned every corner inside the volcano, confirmed there was no Dark Mandala, and immediately flickered above the next volcano, continuing the previous process...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne had searched over a hundred volcanoes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And until now, he still found nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This surprised Osborne a bit. "Is the Dark Mandala really so rare? Even with Satan's Eye, it's this hard to find such a flower. Those others trying to find the Dark Mandala must be in big trouble..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne patiently continued searching.</span></p></div>
