        <h1>Chapter 1751 Stellar Pursuit Mandate</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Send out the order! Issue the Stellar Pursuit Mandate! Hunt down the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings&mdash;kill without mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's voice, cold and dripping with murderous intent, echoed throughout the Bowman family stronghold. Soon, his command was transmitted through specialized channels, reaching every corner of Celestara's Central Zone, West Zone, South Zone, and North Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of moments, every major city and influential faction received the chilling directive from the Bowman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Stellar Pursuit Mandate was issued!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hunt down the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Images of Osborne, Anastasia, and the others flashed across screens in various clans. Anyone who spotted them was authorized to kill on sight, collecting their severed heads to bring back to the Bowman family for a handsome reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings quickly became a hot topic of conversation across the realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>News of their exploits in Wild Flame City spread like wildfire, and the names "Theodore" and "Vivienne" were on everyone's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, the Stellar Pursuit Mandate! The Bowman family is serious about wiping out the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! Just providing their location will net you 10 thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals! That's enough to keep any major faction stocked for a long time!" one warrior exclaimed, eyes wide with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if you manage to kill any one of the Seven Young Deity Kings, the Bowman family will reward you with a Supreme Malevolence Sword or a Supreme Malevolence Shield, plus ten Celestial Crystals! If you can provide precise intel leading to their complete annihilation, the reward skyrockets to a hundred Celestial Crystals, along with both the Sword and Shield! Imagine getting your hands on those!" another added, practically salivating at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can personally take down any of the Seven, aside from the Sword and Shield, you'll also earn a thousand Celestial Crystals and a Miracle Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good heavens, the rewards are just too enticing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless warriors from major factions gasped at the bountiful promises laid out by the Bowman family. The allure was irresistible; they were itching to leap into action and hunt down the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings to claim their prizes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The offerings were a game changer for aspiring talents across the realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Supreme Malevolence Sword, the Supreme Malevolence Shield, and the Supreme Malevolence Airship&mdash;each one could significantly enhance a warrior's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield were coveted artifacts reserved solely for the super geniuses of the Paramount Supreme Clan. Other talented warriors from rival factions could only look on with envy and jealousy, dreaming of the day they might lay their hands on such powerful weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the game had changed. The opportunity to acquire these legendary items was within reach for anyone bold enough to take down the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings. Even just providing information about their whereabouts could land a warrior the coveted Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that wasn't all. There were also Celestial Crystals, capable of enhancing one's potential and helping to break through to the Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To top it off, the rewards included Miracle Elixirs with even more potent effects!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such an enticing array of prizes on the table, it was no surprise that talented individuals from various clans were stirred to action. Even some of the other factions within the Paramount Supreme Clan couldn't resist the allure of these rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't just the young talents who were captivated. Many seasoned warriors, including those in the mid-stage of the Deity King realm and even some in the late stages, found themselves tempted by the reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, warriors from the Central Zone, South Zone, and North Zone set out towards the East Zone, specifically Wild Flame City, eager to track down the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings and claim the Bowman family's bounty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Stellar Pursuit Mandate was plastered on the walls of every city, and the promise of riches sent everyone who laid eyes on it into a frenzy of excitement and ambition. The hunt was on, and the realm buzzed with the anticipation of chaos and conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the tantalizing rewards set forth by the Bowman family, most people quickly came to their senses upon learning about the combat records of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the allure of wealth was tempting, it also required the strength to claim it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Young Deity Kings, all of the Deity Overlord rank, possessed the ability to defeat&mdash;even kill&mdash;early-stage Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader, "Theodore", had famously killed Aldrich, a mid-stage Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where in the world did this Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings come from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Deity Overlord killing a mid-stage Deity King? I find that hard to believe! There must be some shady dealings involved; otherwise, it wouldn't have happened!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they're the Seven Great Deity Kings, it's still a stretch to claim they can eliminate a mid-stage Deity King easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count me skeptical; it sounds like a tall tale!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumors swirled among the factions. "Did you hear? Orson Adkins from the Thunderstorm Drake Clan just broke through to Deity King rank! He's already headed to Wild Flame City, vowing to take down every one of the Seven!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Stellan Lancelot, the prodigy from the Snow Fox Clan, is on his way too! He claims he's only interested in Theodore," another voice piped up, excitement bubbling beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget about the genius from the Raging Elephant Clan..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The genius from the Glory Eagle Clan..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire Tiger Clan..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it seems like the top talents from the ten Upper Races in the Central Zone, as long as they're not in closed-door training, are all rushing towards the East Zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even some of the talented warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan are making their way there..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some seasoned Deity Kings, both mid and late-stage, are headed to the East Zone as well!"</span></p></div>
