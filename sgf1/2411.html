        <h1>Chapter 2326 Lincoln Sanders</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad lay sprawled on the ground. Though still conscious, his face was a mask of excruciating pain, features twisted in a grimace. His eyes were wide, brimming with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a short while ago, when Osborne claimed he could take him down with three arrows, Conrad thought he was off his rocker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he'd failed to even withstand two of Osbor</span><span>ne's shots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disparity in their strength was like night and day. It was as if Conrad was a helpless toddler up against a buff, gym-junkie adult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were operating on completely different planes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another blast snapped Conrad out of his daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to see his teammates&mdash;Malcolm and the rest&mdash;getting skewered by Osborne's Sacred Power arrows. Their bodies were sent flying through the air before crashing to the ground, knocked out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad's face went as white as a sheet. If he couldn't handle Osborne's arrows, how could his teammates? They'd all been taken out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne strode over, clutching his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He loomed over Conrad, calm as a cucumber, his eyes brimming with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember when I said I'd beat you with three arrows? You believe me now, don't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about when I said you weren't fit to ask me to join your team? Still think I was wrong? Next time you cross my path, lose that big-headed attitude. Otherwise, next time won't just leave you hurting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a cold smile and casually reached out his hand. Conrad's badge seemed to be magnetically drawn to it, landing right in Osborne's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a sinking feeling hit Conrad like a ton of bricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His points had taken a ten-percent nosedive, while Osborne's skyrocketed by 330 thousand, shooting his total up to 7.6 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Horace, the second-ranked player, had 7.63 million points. Osborne was just a stone's throw away, trailing by a mere 30 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Agatha was hot on Horace's heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Horace caught wind of Agatha's intentions, he didn't even think about running. Instead, he ditched his search for Osborne and made a beeline straight for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd in Frost Peak City went wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The initial hype about Osborne taking down Conrad with just two arrows quickly fizzled out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Conrad was only ranked fifteenth, while Agatha and Horace were the cream of the crop, sitting at the top two spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the state duel, Agatha and Horace were the undisputed superstars. Right at this moment, the fateful clash between the two was finally about to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd chattered excitedly. "The showdown between Agatha and Horace is definitely the championship bout! They're the top two in both strength and current points. The one who comes out on top here will surely be crowned the champion of this state duel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every now and then, someone would bring up Osborne's impressive takedown of Conrad, suggesting he might also be in the running for the title. But those comments were quickly shot down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone retorted, "Osborne's got a long way to go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, he beat Conrad, and he's a tough competitor. But most of the top ten could do the same if they really pushed themselves. Agatha, though, took down Broderick and Benson without breaking a sweat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compared to Agatha, Osborne's strength is next to nothing. I bet he wouldn't last thirty seconds against her, hell, not even ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only one who stands a chance against Agatha is Horace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne might end up being the fifth-best in this state duel, trailing behind Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson. But he's no threat to the top four!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just been lucky and managed to rack up those points!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Couldn't agree more!" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd kept on gossiping, Agatha and Horace were closing in on each other. Their upcoming face-off had billions of viewers in Frost Peak City on the edge of their seats. Everyone's eyes were fixed on the projected images, practically salivating in anticipation of the big showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bunch of competitors in the vicinity quickly flocked over to watch the action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hardly anyone noticed that Osborne, Clara, and Leroy were about to have a new opponent breathing down their necks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A solitary figure strolled over, radiating an air of quiet but deadly power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Lincoln Sanders!" Leroy blurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned serious as she laid eyes on the newcomer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lincoln is the eighth-strongest competitor, and he's currently sitting at eleventh on the points leaderboard with 3.5 million points. He's made it that high all by himself. His power has got to be off the charts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded thoughtfully, sizing Lincoln up from head to toe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're thinking of taking us on? Trying to steal our points? I'd think twice if I were you. You still have a shot at making it into the top ten. Attack us, and you might just throw that chance away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln's eyes narrowed as Osborne spoke. He could feel the overpowering self-assurance rolling off the man in waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a kind of alpha-male dominance that left him both in disbelief and a little ticked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes wandered over to the defeated members of Conrad's team, and his expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln took a deep breath and turned to Osborne. "Looks like everyone really underestimated you! Those Zephyr State bigwigs ranking you outside the top hundred? That's just a total joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In no time flat, you've wiped out Conrad's whole team. Hell, even I'd have a hard time pulling that off. You're definitely top-ten worthy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said this, a fire of determination blazed in Lincoln's eyes. "But there's no way I'm backing down. I'm a warrior, and I can't just walk away from a challenge. If you want me out of here, you're gonna have to beat me first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it means I kiss my top-ten chances goodbye? I don't give a damn! I came here to take on the best, and you're not gonna deny me that, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he talked, Lincoln's aura flared up. His already imposing figure seemed to grow even larger, and his skin started to glow a bright, golden hue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at him, a bit taken aback, then nodded. "If that's how you feel, I'm all in! You want a fight? Let's go! I could use a few impressive wins to scare off anyone else who's thinking about stealing my points."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast a quick look over Lincoln's shoulder and noticed a crowd of onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A good number of them were top-thirty competitors or members of elite teams. They'd come, all fired up, hoping to catch some high-octane action. But now, they hung back, watching as Lincoln stepped up to the plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln flashed a smirk. "You're looking to pad your win record with me, huh? I've gotta give you props for your confidence. Just make sure your skills can back up all that swagger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't be let down," Osborne said, hoisting his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fighting spirit was now in full swing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's roll!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this party started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln's golden-hued skin began to shimmer, creating a glowing shield around him. He balled his fist and launched a thunderous punch straight at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The might of his golden fist sent a terrifying energy wave hurtling towards his foe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne whipped up a Sacred Power arrow and let it fly with deadly accuracy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power arrow and Lincoln's golden punch met in a cataclysmic clash, sending shockwaves rippling through the air.</span></p></div>
