        <h1>Chapter 2561 Entering the Royal Sepulcher-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The towering peak was shrouded by an immense defensive shield, even Osborne's Satan's Eye couldn't penetrate it. He could only see the entrance to the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are only two doors to enter the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the doors is in the Palace. From the Palace, you can directly enter the Royal Sepulcher. That is the main entrance of the Royal Sepulcher. The other door is a side entrance, located on the side of the Palace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only those with very high status and position can enter the Royal Sepulcher directly through the main entrance in the Palace, while Osborne and others can only use the side entrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even the side entrance is massive and imposing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the side entrance of the Royal Sepulcher, Osborne couldn't help but breathe a little faster, his body trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Clara and Leroy noticed something was off with Osborne and asked worriedly, "Osborne, are you okay?" Fortunately, the three of them were at the back. Otherwise, Osborne's unusual behavior would have been noticed by everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had finally returned to the Royal Sepulcher and could finally visit Michelle's tomb to pay his respects.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could Osborne not be excited?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he knew his unusual behavior might attract attention, so he had to forcibly suppress his excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm fine, just a bit nervous," Osborne casually gave a reason. "It's said that the Royal Sepulcher is the resting place of Solomon, one of the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet and the founder of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. He was one of the most legendary warriors of the Racial Convergence Planet. Since we're here at the Royal Sepulcher, I hope to pay my respects to him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Clara and Leroy both showed expressions of admiration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "Don't worry. Now that we're here, they'll definitely let us pay our respects to Solomon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said nothing more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, they arrived at the side gate. Looking at the towering gate, Osborne had completely calmed down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What awaited them next was a strict identity check.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, once the inspectors confirmed everyone was fine, a gap appeared in the massive defense shield at the side gate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Follow me inside. In the Royal Sepulcher, no noise is allowed. If you disturb the ancestors of the Royal Family, no one can save you," Justina reminded again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone nodded and followed Justina through the defense shield, finally entering the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, towering peaks appeared before their eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brilliant light and colorful rays radiated from the peak, leaving everyone stunned with their mouths agape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So much energy!" someone murmured, "It's said that this peak has been worshipped by the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom for tens of thousands of years, becoming an incredibly powerful Sacred Artifact that protects the Glorious Divine Kingdom. If a powerful enemy attacks the Palace of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, this peak will transform into a weapon to annihilate all enemies."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, everyone&rsquo;s faces were filled with shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne paid no attention to the peak, as he had seen it countless times in his previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, this mountain is called Supreme Overlord Mount.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It is indeed an incredibly powerful Sacred Artifact. Each time the Glorious Divine Kingdom holds a ritual, half of the ritual's power is absorbed by the reigning Glorious Divine Emperor, while the other half is absorbed by the Supreme Overlord Mount.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Supreme Overlord Mount is indeed very powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne didn&rsquo;t know exactly how powerful it was, as he had never seen the Supreme Overlord Mount truly activated or unleash its power.</span></p></div>
