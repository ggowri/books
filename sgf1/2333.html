        <h1>Chapter 2275 Surprise</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surprise?" Osborne had almost forgotten about it until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His curiosity was instantly piqued. Since his solitary cultivation hadn't led to a breakthrough, he sprang up from his seat, left his place, and made a beeline for Angela's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a short trip, and before long, he was at her doorstep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door swung open, and Angela's voice rang out from inside. "Come on in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped in and saw Angela grinning at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen, what's this big surprise? You're making it all hush-hush. I'm starting to think it'll give me a heart-attack!" he quipped with a playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela gave him a sassy eye-roll. "Do I look like the type to pull a stunt like that? It's definitely something awesome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, Angela turned in a certain direction and bowed deeply with respect. "Ms. Alba!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A calm voice sounded, and a figure suddenly appeared right in front of Osborne. He let out a surprised gasp and quickly bowed low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good day, Ms. Alba!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who'd just walked in was Adriana from the Fairy Moon Sect. Osborne never thought Angela would go and invite her.</span><br><span>Is all this for my sake?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana nodded at Osborne. Her incredibly beautiful face took on an appraising look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angela told me about you. I have to say, I was floored to hear you won the city duel in Tempest Fortress City. And at just the Ascension Eight level! Your fighting skills are top-notch, even in Fairy Moon Sect. You're one of the best!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angela asked me to talk to you again about joining the Fairy Moon Sect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne whipped around to look at Angela, totally </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave him a wink, and he heard her voice in his head. "Osborne! You can't say no this time! Do you have any idea how big a deal it is for Adriana to invite you twice?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a real hotshot! You shouldn't waste your talent in a Second-rate Power like Mystic Sirius Sect. Joining Fairy Moon Sect would supercharge your growth and set you up for success. With your potential, I'm sure you'll become a powerful Empyrean Sacredness warrior in no time. You might even outshine me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And just picture this&mdash;you'll get to catch up with Isa and Clarissa, won't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that, Osborne couldn't help but force a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never guessed that Angela's so-called "surprise" would be Adriana inviting him to join the Fairy Moon Sect for the second time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, Osborne felt a twinge of pride welling up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana was a heavy-hitter in the Glorious Divine Kingdom. For her to personally invite someone like him, who hadn't even made it to the Empyrean Sacredness level, not just once but twice? That was something to puff your chest out about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chances were, he was the only one who got to enjoy this privilege.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite the pride, deep down, he knew he couldn't say yes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a short while, he was going to take on his former mother in </span><span>the </span><span>Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And after that, he'd start plotting his revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ones he was gunning for weren't just ordinary foes. They were the princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom who had picked on him and his mother, the powerful bigwigs in the realm, and even the ruler himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father from his past life, </span><span>the </span><span>Glorious Divine Emperor, who was the mightiest of them all, was on his list of people to settle scores with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who had ever done them harm or played dirty tricks was now Osborne's enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was going to get his revenge, no doubt about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was fully aware that one false move could land him in a hopeless situation. That was why Osborne didn't want to rope </span><span>the </span><span>Fairy Moon Sect into this mess. They wouldn't be able to lend a hand, nor could they protect him from the approaching storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and finally spoke out, "Ms. Olsen, I really appreciate your kindness. And Ms. Alba, thanks for thinking so highly of me. But sorry, I still can't join the Fairy Moon Sect. It's a personal choice..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he finished talking, an awkward quiet filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela stood there, utterly flabbergasted. She never thought Osborne would turn down Adriana's second invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Adriana raised her eyebrows in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I told you I'd take you as my direct disciple, just like I did with Isa? You'd be my fourth personal prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Then, would you think about joining the Fairy Moon Sect?" Adriana insisted, her voice firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at her, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Becoming Adriana's personal disciple? That would instantly make him one of the heirs of the Fairy Moon Sect. In the not-too-distant future, he might even become the sect's next leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be frank, Osborne was tempted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a fast-track to becoming a big shot, instantly catapulting him to the top echelons of society in the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom and even on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could skip the state and zone duels and attend the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel as Adriana's personal disciple, sitting pretty in the VIP section.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep in his heart, Osborne knew he had to say no again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Adriana thought highly of him, the more he felt he couldn't drag her into his mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fairy Moon Sect was a heavy-hitter. Among all the First-rate Powers, it was one of the most powerful and was on the verge of becoming the fourth Top-tier Power on the Racial Convergence Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when stacked up against the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the Fairy Moon Sect still didn't measure up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the sect went head-to-head with the kingdom, it would be wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't going to let that happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed deeply to Adriana with genuine sincerity. "Thanks again for your generosity, Ms. Alba. I'm really moved by the honor you've offered me. But I'm truly sorry, I can't join Fairy Moon Sect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana frowned deeply. "Why? Give me a good reason!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and stared her straight in the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Alba, if one day I have to take on a Top-tier Power, will Fairy Moon Sect be able to have my back? Will it stand by me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana was taken aback by his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She locked eyes with him, and he held his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she shook her head. "No, we can't shield you! We won't give you any direct support! We'll just tell you not to go down that path because it's like signing your own death warrant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle and nodded. "I get it! But there are some things in this world that just have to be done, right? Even if it means going down in flames, even if I know it might cost me my life... I've got to do them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why I'm not joining Fairy Moon Sect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana stared at Osborne in disbelief. After a moment, she let out a sigh, realizing he was set on his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then! It looks like you and Fairy Moon Sect just aren't a good fit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't force the issue. But I'll be around for the next two days. If you need any help with your training, just come and ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, this doesn't mean you're becoming my disciple! It's just a friendly offer&mdash;some casual guidance..." she added, flashing a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne perked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Ms. Alba, could you give me some pointers on how to combine more powers and refine my Sacred Power?"</span></p></div>
