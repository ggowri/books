        <h1>Chapter 2561 Entering the Royal Sepulcher-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Sepulcher is located at the foot of the Supreme Overlord Mount.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne looked toward the Royal Sepulcher. But soon, he showed a disappointed expression because the Royal Sepulcher was still shrouded in a force. His Satan's Eye was useless here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne forcibly suppressed his excitement, thinking, "Don't rush. I will definitely have a chance to pay respects to my mother later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justina led the group quickly toward the Supreme Overlord Mount and arrived in front of the Royal Sepulcher. On a vast open ground, the Royal Sepulcher was shrouded in mist, with only one tomb visible from the outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That tomb was at the very center of the Royal Sepulcher, with an incredibly massive tombstone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justina said, "This is the tomb of Solomon, the ancestor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is where the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony will soon be held. Shortly after, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel will also take place here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You now have ten minutes to enter the Royal Sepulcher and pay respects to Solomon, the ancestor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Remember, you only have ten minutes. Do not wander around in the Royal Sepulcher. It is extremely dangerous inside, with numerous formations for protection. If you take the wrong path and enter a formation, you will surely die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Justina's words, Osborne immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had originally planned to find an opportunity to sneak into the Royal Sepulcher to pay respects to Michelle. However, Justina directly gave them ten minutes to pay respects to Solomon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne could openly enter the Royal Sepulcher during these ten minutes to pay respects to Michelle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Royal Sepulcher is shrouded in mist. No one can see inside from the outside. In that case, I don't have to worry about anyone discovering that I'm paying respects to my mother."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne walked into the Royal Sepulcher. The others had already started moving as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Glorious Divine Kingdom, Solomon was absolutely a legendary figure. Many tens of thousands of years ago, the Racial Convergence Planet was ruled by the Overpowering Dynasty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Overpowering Dynasty was extremely brutal, treating the creatures of the Racial Convergence Planet like slaves and livestock. All beings on the Racial Convergence Planet lived as if in hell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, the Racial Convergence Planet was called Dark Planet, a world shrouded in darkness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such circumstances, twelve supreme warriors from various races took action. They overthrew the rule of the Overpowering Dynasty and saved the creatures on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were known as the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet, and Solomon, the founder of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, was one of the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The story of the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet has been passed down for tens of thousands of years on the Racial Convergence Planet. Every young warrior of the Glorious Divine Kingdom looks up to Solomon as an idol.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, upon learning there was a chance to personally pay homage to Solomon, everyone eagerly rushed into the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne still walked at the back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering the Royal Sepulcher and being shrouded by the mist, Osborne said to Clara and Leroy, "You go pay homage to Solomon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, they were both very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara whispered, "What about you? Justina said we can only pay homage to Solomon and must not wander around in the Royal Sepulcher because it's very dangerous. Also, if we get caught, we might be severely punished."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and nodded, "I know. But I have something very important that I must do. And now is the best opportunity. Don't ask too much, and don't worry about me. I'll be fine and won't cause any trouble. Just pretend you know nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne waved his hand and, not wanting to waste any more time, quickly disappeared from the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with worry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Clara gritted her teeth and said, "Let's do as Osborne said. We must trust him. He must have his reasons for doing this. Let's pretend we know nothing and avoid drawing any attention."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy nodded. "Let's go. I really hope nothing happens to him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them followed the others toward Solomon's tomb. Meanwhile, Osborne had already ventured deep into the Royal Sepulcher, gradually approaching its more secluded areas.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Michelle was buried at the very edge of the Royal Sepulcher. He would never forget that spot.</span></p></div>
