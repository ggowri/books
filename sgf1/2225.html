        <h1>Chapter 2204 Capture Them All-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Equipped with the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, Osborne sliced through the boundless expanse of the cosmos like a comet, his pursuit of the targets unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox and his gang thought they could shake him off by scattering in different directions, but it was a move so naive it was almost comical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second one was down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third one caught!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fourth one neutralized!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the Ascending Sacred Sanctum materialized right in front of Maddox, the other six members of his group were already out cold, tossed carelessly into a corner of the sanctum like discarded toys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair etched itself across Maddox's face like a dark shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hissed through clenched teeth, "Osborne, my men and I have already left Celestara Planet. Why are you coming after us like a rabid dog? I was just Zayne's pawn, lured here against my will. I haven't laid a finger on any member of the Human Community. We're not foes. Let me go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you spare me, I'll be at your beck and call! You know I'm from the Mystic Sirius Sect on Racial Convergence Planet. It's a heavy-hitting sect, well-known and powerful. I'm a disciple</span><span> ranked the seventh</span><span>, and the elders have their eyes on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They know I'm here. If I don't make it back on time, they'll send someone to look into it for sure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that day comes, you'll be the one facing the music!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Taking me out won't do you any good; it'll just land you in a world of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, just let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's face was a picture of sheer desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't suppress a sneer at his plea. "You want me to let you off the hook? And then what? You think the Mystic Sirius Sect will send someone to investigate? You think I'll be the one in the doghouse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox said, his voice steely, "Precisely! I'm not trying to strong-arm you. I'm just laying it on the line. You don't want to start a hornet's nest, do you? You're gifted and powerful, but on Racial Convergence Planet and within the Mystic Sirius Sect, your might doesn't amount to much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any core disciple from Racial Convergence Planet could make mincemeat of you, let alone the elders or the sect master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can't make it back to the Mystic Sirius Sect, they'll dispatch a squad of core disciples to Celestara Planet to get to the bottom of things! Maybe even an elder will make an appearance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're talking about Empyrean Sacredness-level warriors here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox swore he wasn't trying to threaten Osborne, but his words were dripping with veiled threats, using the Mystic Sirius Sect's clout as a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was practically begging Osborne to see that killing him would only spell disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle, his eyes twinkling with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've rambled on a lot, but it all comes down to one simple fact&mdash;you're just clinging to the hope of staying alive, aren't you? Well, tough luck! You're not getting out of here. True, offing you might stir up some trouble, but setting you free to return to the Mystic Sirius Sect? That'd land me in an even bigger mess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's face twitched, a flicker of confusion crossing his features. "What do you mean? If you spare me, I give you my word I'll leave you alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a derisive snort. "Oh, come on, Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't try to pull the wool over my eyes. Do you really think I'm that gullible? If I kill you, maybe a handful of core disciples will show up on Celestara Planet to poke around. But if I let you waltz back to the Mystic Sirius Sect, I can bet my bottom dollar that it won't be long before I've got a bunch of Empyrean Sacredness warriors breathing down my neck, gunning for my head!"</span></p></div>
