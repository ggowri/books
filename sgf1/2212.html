        <h1>Chapter 2194 Different People</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Merge the memories of the God of Night?!" Osborne felt a daze wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he could accept the truth of being the reincarnation of the God of Night, merging those memories felt like an entirely different ball game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, for him at present, those were the memories of someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would it change who I am?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would I become someone else entirely? What if...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a myriad of concerns that ultimately led him to shake his head firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not ready for that! Let's just hold off on it for now. I want to defeat Lord Malevolence on my own strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a fierce determination flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merging the God of Night's memories might make him stronger and increase his chances against Lord Malevolence, but Osborne was not willing to take that route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He longed to face his foe with his own abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, however, wasn't disheartened by his decision. "Alright! We'll talk about it later!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be here, waiting for you. I believe in you&mdash;you can defeat Lord Malevolence and bring an end to this war! I've believed in you from the start!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she stepped back, a look of confidence on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne inhaled deeply, swiftly moving forward to confront Lord Malevolence, their eyes locking in a silent standoff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night, you&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence began to speak, but Osborne interrupted smoothly, "Don't call me 'God of Night'! Even if I really am his reincarnation, I'm not the same person anymore! My name is Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dismissive scoff escaped Lord Malevolence's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night, you've lost your memories. Honestly, it's laughable! But since you want to be called Osborne, I'll play along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just know this&mdash;you have no chance against me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've broken through to Ascension Ten! And you? You're just at Ascension Six! Even with your so-called superior reincarnation, you can't possibly defeat me at that level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't flatter yourself&mdash;whether you're Ascension Six or even Ascension Nine, you're going down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My offer still stands&mdash;lead the Human Community to surrender, and I won't slaughter them. I can even grant your people a unique status, just below that of the Paramount Supreme Clan. And you? You can still stand beside me to rule Celestara Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll be the second king of the Malevolence Empire, equal to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Together, we'll return to Racial Convergence Planet and establish ourselves as a dominant force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's eyes glowed with ambition as he spoke, fixating on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smirk curled up on Osborne's lips. "Is that all you've got to say? Well, if so, let's kick this battle off! Do you really think Ascension Ten is something to brag about? Your arrogance made me almost believe you'd reached the Empyrean Sacredness. You want me to lead the Human Community into surrender, rule alongside you, and become the second king of the Malevolence Empire?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, but that doesn't appeal to me at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm only focused on one thing&mdash;defeating you&mdash;no, it's more than that. I'm going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne made this bold declaration, Lord Malevolence's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! Since that's your stance, let's prove our mettle in this fight! You're itching to take me down, and I'm more than eager to go toe-to-toe with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's find out who'll be the victor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant Lord Malevolence uttered those words, a colossal surge of power burst forth from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An imposing suit of armor materialized around his body&mdash;the Eclipse War Armor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew solemn. Despite his self-assurance in his own capabilities, he had to admit that Lord Malevolence, an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, was the most formidable adversary he had ever faced in combat. This was bound to be a legendary battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Whether I can defeat Lord Malevolence with my current strength remains uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But this fight is inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He won't spare me any more time to grow or enhance my cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, it's time to engage in battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne summoned the Sacred Power flowing within him, unleashing a fearsome force that silently clashed with Lord Malevolence's might. To everyone's surprise, he managed to hold his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was only at Ascension Four, while Lord Malevolence was at Ascension Ten, the latter hadn't fully integrated his powers or mastered the Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that very Sacred Power was the key to narrowing the gap in their cultivation levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence frowned deeply. "I get it now! No wonder you managed to defeat Maddox at Ascension Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've already mastered the Sacred Power! With such remarkable talent, you're even more of a force to be reckoned with than I thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In your past life, those injuries held you back from making a breakthrough. But in this life, they won't be able to stop you. Given enough time, you'd become even stronger than before. By then, I'd stand no chance against you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But today, I'll put an end to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't have a future! If I were in your shoes, I'd lie low instead of coming out here to court death and ignoring the fate of the Human Community on Celestara Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold chuckle. "Well, I'm not you, and you'll never be me. We're two completely different pe</span><span>rsons</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence nodded, his voice tinged with a hint of regret. "True. What a pity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since we can't be friends, then being mortal enemies it is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's a certain satisfaction in taking down an enemy who's haunted you for a thousand years with your own hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smirk appeared on Osborne's face. "Is that so? You view me as a mortal enemy, but I see you as just another obstacle to overcome&mdash;a mere nuisance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frankly, you're talking too much! Are we going to fight or not? If not, then take your men and leave. And I mean</span><span> tru</span><span>ly leav</span><span>ing</span><span> Celestara Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's face clouded over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and snarled, "Fine! Since you haven't regained your memories, I won't hold it against you. But even so, killing you will still bring me great satisfaction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let the battle begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Lord Malevolence sprang into action. An all-consuming darkness emanated from his body, enveloping him. Terrifying dark energy burst forth around him, giving rise to colossal Shadow Drakes that thundered towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew tense. He was familiar with this technique as well, but given the vast gap in their cultivation levels, his version of the move wouldn't be nearly as powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, he had the Sacred Power to rely on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes!" Osborne murmured under his breath, deciding to confront Lord Malevolence head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A succession of fearsome Shadow Drakes burst forth from Osborne's body, colliding with the charging Shadow Drakes from Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Shadow Drakes were smaller and less imposing, lacking the deep, inky blackness of Lord Malevolence's. When they clashed, both sets of dragon forms shattered into fragments, leaving neither side with an upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, great!" Lord Malevolence let out a booming laugh. "That girl may have inherited your past-life power, but she's still too green.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fighting her felt like something was off; it just didn't have that edge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now? Now, the excitement is back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm absolutely convinced that you're the reincarnation of the God of Night! Only you can give me this electrifying thrill!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I've made up my mind. It's time I got serious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me show you my true might!"</span></p></div>
