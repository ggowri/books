        <h1>Chapter 2413 Unbeatable</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne never expected the Cosmic Translocator on Abyssal Planet to be destroyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It seems Mr. Norton and the other adjudicators had an extremely intense battle with the Magma Devourer here. There are at least a dozen bodies nearby, and all of them are adjudicators."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, Mr. Norton and the other adjudicators tried to protect the Cosmic Translocator and stop the Magma Devourer from destroying the translocator, but they failed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a massive pit appeared in the center of the Cosmic Translocator. It was stomped out by the Magma Devourer's enormous forelimb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Cosmic Translocator had completely dimmed and was clearly unusable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, fully repairing it would take a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face looked terrible as he thought, "This is quite troublesome. The Abyssal Planet is incredibly far from the Racial Convergence Planet. We can only return through the Cosmic Translocator. Now that the translocator is destroyed, we're essentially trapped on the Abyssal Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If we want to go back, we can only wait for the Cosmic Translocator to be repaired. Will those adjudicators on the Abyssal Planet repair the translocator? If they can't..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head, forcing himself not to think about this problem for now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For now, the most important thing is to deal with the Magma Devourer first. As for the translocator, the people of the Glorious Divine Kingdom will surely find a way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, among the thousand participants in the zone duel, most are from First-rate Power and are geniuses of First-rate Power. If they are trapped on the Abyssal Planet, the </span><span>top leaders of those First-rate Powers will definitely join forces to pressure the Glorious Divine Kingdom to rescue them as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Now, I have to find a way to kill the Magma Devourer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Magma Devourer really went west. With its power, Mr. Norton, who is at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, and those adjudicators at advanced Empyrean Sacredness couldn't defeat it, and so many people have died.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Leroy and Clara encounter the Magma Devourer, they probably won't even be able to escape."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne became very anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly collected the remains of the adjudicators at advanced Empyrean Sacredness around him and fed them to the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he said, "Flash, let's keep chasing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash seemed to sense Osborne's anxiety. Two more pairs of wings appeared on its back. With three pairs of wings flapping wildly, it dashed forward at incredible speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne discovered that three of Flash's six </span><span>wings controlled</span><span> speed&mdash;the more wings, the faster it went. The other three wings were used for steering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using three pairs of wings, Flash had already reached its maximum speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it added more wings, its speed wouldn't increase but it would become more agile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, Flash has a keen sense of detecting power auras.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Osborne's guidance, Flash could swiftly follow the trail left by Magma Devourer on its own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a fierce battle was still raging in a vast desert.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!" A piercing scream rang out as a referee was engulfed by the flames spewed by Magma Devourer. His defense shattered instantly, and his body melted under the terrifying heat, leaving only white bones behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He's dead!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another referee is dead!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald's face looked terrible. His eyes were filled with anger and killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You beast! You deserve to die!" With that, Gerald launched a frenzied attack on Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Magma Devourer's massive eyes gleamed with disdain, as if mocking Gerald's overconfidence. It didn't even bother to dodge, letting Gerald's attacks land on its body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, Magma Devourer's body merely trembled slightly, effortlessly blocking Gerald's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Gerald's face even grimmer because he simply couldn't defeat it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though he was at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, and Magma Devourer's cultivation level was lower, only at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, he was no match for Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even after giving it his all, he couldn't even harm Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this a Silicon-based Lifeform? Their physical defense is this strong. What race could compare to them? If not for its low intelligence, we would have been wiped out long ago," Gerald couldn't help but sigh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Who would believe that a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection couldn't break the physical defense of a warrior at advanced Empyrean Sacredness?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this is the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a Carbon-based Lifeform, Magma Devourer's body is incredibly strong and sturdy. It not only has terrifying defense but also immense power and even incredible speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Magma Devourer suddenly charged toward a nearby referee. It raised its pillar-like forelimb and stomped down fiercely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Move!" Gerald shouted loudly. Unfortunately, it was useless. After fighting for so long and exhausting countless amounts of Sacred Power, even he felt extremely tired.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other referees were, of course, already nearing their limits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing Magma Devourer's sudden attack, the referee tried to escape, but his body was a step too slow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He paid with his life!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a squelch, Magma Devourer's massive forelimb stomped another advanced Empyrean Sacredness referee to death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made everyone's faces around turn grim, their eyes filled with terror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of retreat arose in their hearts because they simply couldn't defeat it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Norton, shall we retreat?" At this moment, a referee said to Gerald, "If we keep fighting like this, we'll all die here. Magma Devourer's power is terrifying, far beyond what we can handle. We can only wait for Glorious Divine Kingdom to send stronger reinforcements."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only a warrior at least in Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection can defeat it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Gerald angrily said, "Retreat? How are we supposed to retreat? If we retreat, what about the contestants? With their strength and speed, they&rsquo;ll be easily caught by Magma Devourer. If that happens, they will surely die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Reinforcements? Where are the reinforcements? The Cosmic Translocator has already been destroyed. If Glorious Divine Kingdom wants to send reinforcements, they must first teleport them to a nearby resource planet and then traverse the starry skies to get here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By my estimation, this will take at least five days. If we retreat, by the time reinforcements arrive in five days, the contestants here will have already been killed by Magma Devourer. Even if we die, we must hold it off for five days."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Gerald's eyes were filled with bloodshot veins.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It's all my fault. I was too confident, thinking I could handle Magma Devourer, so I didn't seek help from Glorious Divine Kingdom right away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time Gerald realized he couldn't defeat Magma Devourer and wanted to seek help, Magma Devourer had already destroyed the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Glorious Divine Kingdom has many warriors who can defeat Magma Devourer. But without the Cosmic Translocator, they can't get here at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection would take a long time to cross such a vast starry sky to reach Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, they couldn't expect reinforcements anytime soon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald continued, "We are the referees. Our duty is to protect the participants of the zone duel. So, even if we can't defeat it, we must keep fighting."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter what, we must hold on until reinforcements arrive. Otherwise, all the participants will be killed by Magma Devourer. If that happens, we will be sinners."</span></p></div>
