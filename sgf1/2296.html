        <h1>Chapter 2250 The Referee's Bias</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, it wasn't just the audience surrounding the arena that was stunned; even the high-ranking members of the Mystic Sirius Sect up on the platform were in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them had believed Osborne could defeat Vadim before the battle began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Vadim was the reigning champion of the last Sect Tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, on the other hand, was merely an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King, just an inner disciple who had made it to the top twenty by sheer luck, facing weaker opponents in the group matches and relying on his quasi-Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone thought that once he faced Vadim, if he didn't surrender immediately, the only outcome would be a crushing defeat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the reality was completely flipped. Instead of Osborne facing a humiliating loss, it was Vadim who was left in ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a couple of pulls on his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, Osborne unleashed four arrows that utterly dismantled Vadim's defenses and left him severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the elder on the platform was too slow on the draw to save Vadim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arena fell dead silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, shouldn't someone declare me the winner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice cut through the quiet, and in an instant, the crowd exploded into a flurry of chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God, what the hell did I just see?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vadim's been beaten! He didn't even put up a fight! And by who? Just an Ascension Eight inner disciple?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone </span><span>give</span><span> me a pinch! This can't be real! I bet ten thousand Celestial Crystals on Vadim to take the championship! How could he lose? How could he go down like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A dark horse! A bona-fide dark horse has just emerged!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't a fair fight at all! But how on earth is this possible? He's only at Ascension Eight! How could he possibly steamroll Vadim?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the Sacred Power! Osborne must have grasped the Sacred Power ahead of schedule!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, someone hit the bullseye. The reason Osborne could overpower Vadim was that his arrows were imbued with the Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Sacred Power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Angela stared at Osborne in utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He actually managed to master the Sacred Power ahead of time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes glittered with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wielding Sacred Power at the Supernal Deity King Level was a rarity across the whole Racial Convergence Planet. Most folks only managed to access it at Ascension Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here was Osborne, just at the Ascension Eight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was pretty obvious that he hadn't just recently mastered the Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What an incredible talent he was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">His overall score in the Astral Testing Arch must be at least Class SS! He's probably been influenced by that Celestial Progeny, Isa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was over the moon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Peak Lord of the Peak Seven disciples, the more powerful Osborne proved to be, the happier she felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Sacred Power at his disposal, Osborne had just effortlessly defeated Vadim, and it seemed like he was on a winning streak that could very well lead him to the championship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The championship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, Angela wouldn't even have dared to dream of a top-ten finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she could practically feel the championship trophy within Peak Seven's reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion raged on, but at that moment, the referee was carefully examining Vadim's injuries, his face as grim as thunder. Vadim was seriously hurt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd probably need a long time to fully recuperate, and it seemed he was out of the Sect Tournament for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all because he'd been too slow to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Vadim was Lenny's nephew!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim had gotten hurt so badly so early in the tournament. He was bound to catch hell from Lenny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made his blood boil, and he shot Osborne a look of pure fury. "Hey, you've really overstepped! This was just a friendly spar! You're supposed to pull your punches in the arena, for crying out loud! And now you've messed Vadim up so bad he can't even compete anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to the referee, his face registering genuine surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned and retorted, "What's the big idea? Are we not supposed to land a hit in the arena? Before the match, he was the one running his mouth about putting me out of commission for months! If I wasn't up to the task, do you think he'd have gone easy on me? Did you ever tell him to take it easy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The referee's face turned beet-red with anger. "Are you really trying to twist things? Do you even know who Vadim is? He was the champ of the last Mystic Sirius Sect Tournament! He fought for our honor in the city duel at Tempest Fortress City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you've messed him up so bad he can't even take part in the upcoming city duel! And you're saying you've done nothing wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but let out a scornful laugh. "He's just a loser I took down with four arrows! Thinking he could bring honor to the Mystic Sirius Sect? That's a joke! You'd be better off counting on me to make the Mystic Sirius Sect shine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." The referee was left speechless for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, he knew Osborne had a valid argument, but given Vadim's standing, he felt obliged to stick up for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, though, brushed off the referee's outrage and shifted his focus to Lenny, the sect leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wilkens, can we declare me the winner now? Or is Vadim too full of himself to admit defeat? He can dish it out, but I'm not allowed to fight back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lenny's face was set in a serious expression as he stared intently at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a short while, he spoke up, "In this match, Osborne is the winner! Vadim was outclassed, and he lost. That's his own fault! The honor of the Mystic Sirius Sect should rightfully go to the stronger fighter! You're not bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Lenny flashed a smile at Osborne. Despite Vadim being his nephew, his attitude was surprisingly amiable. There was real admiration in his eyes for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Ascension Eight warrior who has mastered Sacred Power? It's been ages since we've had a talent like you in the Mystic Sirius Sect! I hope you keep challenging yourself. In the upcoming city duel at Tempest Fortress City, and even in the state duel, I'm counting on you to bring glory to the Mystic Sirius Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the time comes, the Mystic Sirius Sect won't forget your contributions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lenny finished his speech, the crowd broke into a flurry of excited whispers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! Mr. Wilkens is pinning his hopes on Osborne, the dark horse! He really thinks Osborne can represent the Mystic Sirius Sect in the city duel and state duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not? He's got Sacred Power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been centuries since someone at the Supernal Deity King level had that kind of power! Even in state duels, there aren't many with Sacred Power! Osborne might just be a real star in the state duel..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne has earned it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sure he's going to win this Sect Tournament! Too bad I didn't place my bet on him earlier. The odds have dropped from a hundred-to-one to just a measly one-to-1.1!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective groan of disappointment filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, down at the edge of the arena, Jamar and Bethan stared at Osborne with deep worry on their faces. The confidence they once had was quickly fading away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had thought Vadim would remain their toughest hurdle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, out of the blue, Osborne had burst onto the scene!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Osborne had mastered Sacred Power and defeated Vadim with just four arrows sent shivers of unease down their spines.</span></p></div>
