        <h1>Chapter 2149 A New Hero</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The notion of surrender spread like a contagion, infecting the minds of those present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While most were too afraid to voice their doubts, the seeds of hesitation had already taken root in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light observed the crowd with a heavy heart, her emotions swirling in turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood this reaction all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only she were stronger&mdash;if she possessed the power of the God of Night, if she could single-handedly take on Lord Malevolence, perhaps the Human Alliance would have more faith in her. They wouldn't even entertain the idea of surrender if she inspired confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a wave of fatigue washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night felt exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a thousand years, she had protected the Human Community of Celestara, never once faltering. Yet, despite her unwavering dedication, they had never fully trusted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, she was merely a subordinate of the God of Night. Now, with him absent, despair loomed like a dark cloud over the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even she, without the God of Night, struggled to believe she could shield them from the impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Once this battle is over, perhaps it's time I live for myself. The God of Night once said that this cosmos is vast and boundless. I shouldn't confine myself to the small world of Celestara Planet. I should explore greater horizons! I should live for myself once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she quickly steeled herself and addressed the crowd, "Everyone, it's not time to surrender yet! We shouldn't give in to despair so soon! Yes, the Dark Deity Legion is powerful, and the Paramount Supreme Clan is formidable, but if they want to wipe us out, we'll make them pay for every inch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I urge you all, for the sake of our people, let's fight one more battle! Do you really want to become vassals of the Paramount Supreme Clan? Do you wish to live as slaves to them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Living like that is no life at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her words hung in the air, a tense silence enveloped the crowd. Some regained a flicker of morale, but it was barely enough to ignite a flame of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light is right!" Suddenly, a clear, resolute voice broke through the gloom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young girl stepped forward, flanked by a few others. The crowd parted respectfully, their expressions shifting to one of reverence as they recognized her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Anastasia, accompanied by Zoe, Mila, Kendra, and Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four had recently made waves in the border competitions, and even the Ascension Three warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan had struggled against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their reputations had soared, earning them respect among the leaders of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's expression was grave. "I'd rather die standing than live on my knees! I refuse to become a vassal to anyone or a slave to any force! No matter how you all feel, the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community will fight until our last breath!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as we draw breath, as long as there's even a glimmer of hope, we will not back down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it just war? We're not afraid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fierce declaration left the crowd momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jethro stepped forward, his voice ringing out with conviction. "That's right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care what anyone else thinks! The Hudson family won't surrender or retreat! Every single one of us will fight until the very end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Paramount Supreme Clan wants to destroy the Human Community, they'll have to go through us first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jethro spoke, more and more leaders from the Human Community began to find their resolve. The fear that had gripped them started to fade, replaced by a fierce determination to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite the growing fervor, many still felt a deep sense of despair lurking beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice coldly scoffed, saying, "Fight until the last moment? Sounds brave! But when you know you're outmatched and still choose to throw your life away... what's the point of bravery if you're just going to be wiped out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without God of Night, how can we stand against the Paramount Supreme Clan? We don't even need Lord Malevolence to step in; just a few Dark Sovereigns, along with the Dark Deity Legion, could wipe out every Human Community in the West Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that we don't want to fight for the Human Community; it's that there's no hope! If God of Night were here, just a call from him would rally us to battle with the Dark Deity Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, God of Night has been missing for far too long! I fear he has abandoned us, that there's no hope left for the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his words echoed in the air, Anastasia's icy gaze shot over to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She retorted, her voice steady, "Without God of Night, does that mean we can't fight? Does it mean we're destined to fail?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! We can win!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if God of Night doesn't come to our rescue, even if he has given up on us, I believe that a new hero will rise within the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He will come to save us at the crucial moment and put an end to this thousand-year-long war!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's conviction was unshakeable, and in her mind, Osborne's image flashed vividly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said he was going to deep space to find a way to break through his cultivation level! He'll be back within a month! </span><span>By</span><span> </span><span>my </span><span>calculat</span><span>ion</span><span>, he's almost back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he returns, everything will change!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Night? Osborne won't be any less than him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she thought this, she kept it to herself; everyone else, except for God of Light and Jethro, believed Osborne was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia wasn't sure if any of those present had already betrayed the Human Community by siding with the Paramount Supreme Clan, so she kept Osborne's survival a secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was alive and had entered deep space, seeking the power to end this war once and for all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the scoffer snorted again, looking down at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, do you even hear yourself? Without God of Night's help, how do you expect us to fight the Paramount Supreme Clan? How do we stand against the Dark Deity Legion? Who will face Lord Malevolence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A new hero for the Human Community? Ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think your words will persuade us to throw ourselves at the Dark Deity Legion? Who do you think will emerge as our hero?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You? The Seven Young Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't take this the wrong way. I respect your talent, but you're all too inexperienced. Your cultivation levels are just too low!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If a full-scale war breaks out, the Human Community in the West Zone will be annihilated in no time! You won't have a chance to grow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all are nothing but Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ain't got the chops to be the heroes of the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, the crowd erupted in heated debate, casting pitying glances at Anastasia and her companions, shaking their heads in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fists clenched as she retorted, "How can you say we, the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community, won't become heroes? Maybe I can't do it, but Os..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She abruptly halted, realizing she almost revealed that Osborne was still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp exhale, Anastasia declared, "In any case! The Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community will not surrender or retreat! Because the hope of the Human Community still exists!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will fight until the last moment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Anastasia turned and strode away, her determination unyielding.</span></p></div>
