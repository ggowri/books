        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man raised an eyebrow. "Who?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Vidar!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne spoke, and the man immediately widened his eyes and abruptly stood up. "Vidar? Are you really someone referred by Vidar? Hasn't Vidar been missing for over a thousand years? Is he still alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes flickered with a trace of sadness upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vidar Elrod was once his friend. He was an ordinary man living at the bottom of Nebula City. Osborne, as a prince, was constantly targeted, humiliated, and beaten in the Palace, so he often secretly left the Palace to the Outer City to clear his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such circumstances, he met Vidar and a group of others, becoming good friends with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Spending time with ordinary people like Vidar, Osborne felt more at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But later, Michelle was executed, and he was banished from the Palace, exiled from Nebula City, and even expelled from the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to leave, but a group of mysterious people was hunting him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the critical moment, Vidar and a group of friends saved Osborne and protected him as he fled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne used a one-way Cosmic Translocator to leave the Racial Convergence Planet, escaping the pursuit, but Vidar and the group of friends died.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They sacrificed their lives to save Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Vidar, the nephew of this hotel's owner, was the one who told Osborne that his family had special channels to get people into the Inner City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vidar often went into the Inner City to hang out because of this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of Vidar and the friends from his past life, Osborne clenched his fists and stared at the person opposite him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spoke, "Sir, you don't need to test me! Vidar didn't go missing; he died! He died in the Mountain Ridgy east of Nebula City! Along with him, his group of friends also died...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am also Vidar's friend!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will avenge him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished firmly, and the expression of the person opposite him instantly changed, becoming much softer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like you really are Vidar's friend!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I won't question your identity. Just because you said you'll avenge Vidar, I believe you! Let's go, I'll take you into the Inner City now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man trembled and said, "I should be the one thanking you! After Vidar's death, no one dared to avenge him, not even dared to speak about it, let alone investigate! Even I was consumed by fear!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are the first person to say you'll avenge him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't know if you'll succeed, but I hope you do! This is the Inner City's token. With this token, you won't have to worry about being investigated!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, the man handed Osborne a token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was once again grateful. With this token, he now had an official identity in the Inner City and no longer needed to hide from patrols.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the man led Osborne to a mirror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Step into this mirror, and you'll come out from the same kind of mirror on the other side of the Inner City! This is my special power, not very useful... I used to send Vidar and the others into the Inner City like this, and we were never discovered."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This mirror hasn't been used since Vidar's death! So, when you came to me, I knew you must be connected to Vidar..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, go in!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wish you all the best! If you encounter danger, just escape through the mirror on the other side!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I understand, thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne walked towards the mirror without hesitation. The seemingly solid mirror transformed into a soft, water-like surface at that moment, and Osborne stepped in effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, he emerged from another identical mirror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he had already arrived in the Inner City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I finally made it in!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured and walked out of the room where the mirror was kept. He found himself in a secluded, narrow alley, and after leaving the alley, he merged into the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I need to first find a hotel where I can observe the Palace and Royal Sepulcher to settle down!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne was thinking, he noticed a hotel ahead surrounded by a bustling crowd.</span></p></div>
