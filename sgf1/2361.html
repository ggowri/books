        <h1>Chapter 2290 Arctic Maw Chasm-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing, the deeper you venture into the Arctic Maw Chasm, the hotter the fire gets, and the fewer tokens you'll find. So, I'm telling you, play it by ear. Don't go diving into the deeper layers just because the tokens there are worth a fortune. It's not worth the risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, finding tokens isn't the only way to rack up points. You can also swipe tokens and points from others. As long as you can take down your opponent, you'll score one-tenth of their points! Sweet deal, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, it's all about who's got the most points. That's how you win this thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rupert finished speaking, the crowd broke into another flurry of chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, folks! Now, I'm gonna take you to check out the Arctic Maw Chasm. Keep in mind, you've got one day to get the lay of the land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Throughout this day, there'll be referees tagging along with you. You'll head down into the Arctic Maw Chasm yourselves to feel the danger. When the actual state duel kicks off, you can pick which layer you want to </span><span>stay in</span><span> on right off the bat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By then, if you run into trouble, the referees will jump in to save your bacon, but that also means you're out of the state duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he said his piece, Rupert's power suddenly washed over everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, a huge Translocator sparked to life. The next second, the world started spinning for everyone. When they finally got their bearings, they found themselves in a winter wonderland of snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right in front of them stood a glistening ice forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bone-chilling cold instantly made everyone's blood run cold, and their faces turned as white as sheets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the top guns below the Empyrean Sacredness level, and yet they were feeling the cold? That was something else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation showed that the surrounding environment was so brutal that an ordinary person wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of surviving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara groaned, her face looking grim, "It's freezing! Is this the Arctic Maw Chasm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Gustave said in a serious tone, "Nah! We ain't even stepped foot inside the Arctic Maw Chasm yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're still outside the place. The conditions in there are way worse than this. Inside, there are gale-force winds that could turn us into human ice cubes in no time. Even on the first layer, you gotta keep pumping out divine or Sacred Power to stay alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm guessing that most of the thousand participants will only be able to handle the first three layers. If they try to enter the fourth layer, they'll either freeze solid within minutes or run into all sorts of other trouble. Maybe only one or two hundred folks will be able to search for tokens on the fourth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the number of people who can make it to the fifth layer probably won't top twenty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for those who can enter the sixth layer, probably just Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The other folks in the top ten might not even be able to search for tokens on the sixth layer. And even if they can, it'll be a real dicey situation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Gustave finished, Clara's expression turned even grimmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to look at Osborne. "Osborne, which layer should we head to for those tokens?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "I'm not sure yet. Let's go in and scope it out first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the whole group started moving forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the glistening ice forest, there was a massive fissure that led deep into the glacier. Once they stepped into the fissure, everyone instantly felt the air turn even colder. The biting wind was like a freezer blast, threatening to turn their blood to ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed that a lot of the folks lower on the power rankings already had faces as white as a ghost. They had to start channeling their divine power just to keep themselves from freezing solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they still hadn't even reached the first layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they trekked through the fissure for a while, a labyrinth of underground ice tunnels unfurled before them, looking like an otherworldly subterranean realm. And all of a sudden, the howling cold wind kicked up a notch, getting even more ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More folks couldn't take the brunt of that frigid wind anymore and started conjuring up their divine power to shield themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert spoke up, "This here is the first layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm! This layer's spread out over a big area, but the environment ain't too gnarly, and the cold wind's not that strong. Take a feel of the situation. We'll make our way to the second layer."</span></p></div>
