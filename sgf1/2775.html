        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey all nodded and responded, "Don't worry. They definitely won't be that fast. It'll take them a long time to find this place, and they might even think we couldn't pass the trial on the fourteenth floor..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, the trial on the fourteenth floor requires fifty mid Empyrean Sacredness level individuals, but there are only four of us. If we hadn't seen it with our own eyes, we wouldn't believe you could take them down so quickly on your own," Clara said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Casey nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they were also in Seraphina's team, they might think Osborne couldn't pass the trial on the fourteenth floor either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in reality, not to mention the fourteenth floor, even the trial on the fifteenth floor was effortless for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All one hundred warriors' projections had reached mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such strength is enough to stop anyone who has just broken through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Seraphina, even a team of dozens would struggle to pass.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne merely drew the Bloodwrought Bow. After he released one arrow, all one hundred warriors' projections shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took no more than one breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the four of them naturally received the highest reward again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They each received another hundred million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The four of them already had over three hundred million battle points each, more than enough to exchange for several high-quality Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is far from over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly led Clara, Leroy, and Casey away from the fifteenth floor and reached the sixteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Satan's Eye, finding the trial area wasn't difficult for them; it only took a few minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the four of them entered the trial area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were still a hundred warriors' projections here. The difference was that the power fluctuations from ten of them had already reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are ten warriors who have reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are also ninety warriors who have broken through to mid Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy even took a deep breath, looking worriedly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just smiled, completely unconcerned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at the Battle Points Monument. When he noticed the highest reward on the Battle Points Monument had increased again, his eyes immediately lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The minimum reward is ten million battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The highest reward has reached one billion battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In other words, if we can finish the fight within ten breaths, we can get the highest reward. The battle points we earn on this level alone would be enough to exchange for a drop of Perfect Dragon Elixir or ten Supreme Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We must get the highest reward."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Among the hundred warriors' projections, ten have reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness, which is no problem for Osborne at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, his cultivation level has also surpassed advanced Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, there is still a gap between them. Osborne has reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness, but even when facing ordinary warriors who have achieved Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, he is confident in defeating them with ease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He can even fight warriors who have reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The warriors' projections who reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness here can at best be considered ordinary talents."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if Osborne hadn't surpassed Empyrean Sacredness, he would still be confident in dealing with them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As the Sacred Power Arrow on Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow shimmered, it split into hundreds of Sacred Power Arrows the moment it shot out, swiftly locking onto a hundred warriors' projections."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After the violent explosion, all the warriors' projections shattered and vanished. Osborne and the other three cleared the stage again, effortlessly earning the highest reward."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They each received another billion battle points."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, Clara, Leroy, and Casey were completely stunned."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They looked at each other, speechless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can Osborne even instantly kill warriors who have reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How strong is Osborne really? Is this the power he gained after breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They felt the gap in strength between them and Osborne had grown even wider."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not long after, the four arrived at the trial area of the seventeenth level. This time, among the hundred warriors' projections, fifty had reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, Osborne still killed them all with a single arrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They also successfully passed the seventeenth level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, Osborne couldn't help but become excited, as they had finally reached the eighteenth level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On the eighteenth level, there is the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p></div>
