        <h1>Chapter 1818 The Power of Lord Malevolence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found himself deep in thought, grappling with the complexities of the Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was divided into early, mid, late, and peak stages. To him, it seemed logical that breaking through the peak would lead to a new level entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But reality was more convoluted than that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Lord Malevolence and the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community, along with the Nine Dark Sovereigns under Lord Malevolence's command, were all significantly stronger than the peak of the Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, they were still referred to as Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Osborne puzzled, wondering if there were hidden tiers beyond the peak that he simply didn't understand yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like a closely guarded secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Hubery, at the pinnacle of the Deity King realm, had no clue what lay beyond. All he knew was that it was a completely new level, one only truly comprehended by those who had reached it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. Since I have some time to kill, I might as well dig into Hubery's memories," Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His curiosity about the secrets that could determine the fate of the Human Community was piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now was the perfect opportunity to sift through Hubery's memories, not just to uncover those secrets but also to gain a deeper understanding of the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Hubery was an elder of the Eldridge family, the first family of the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne immersed himself in Hubery's memories, time slipped away unnoticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, the power of the Paramount Supreme Clan is astonishing!" he murmured, quickly grasping the clan's might through Hubery's recollections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paramount Supreme Clan wasn't large in number, but "not large" was relative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to other races and even the Human Community of Celestara, they boasted a staggering population of around one billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the absolute rulers of Celestara, each member of the Paramount Supreme Clan had access to resources far beyond what others could dream of. From birth, they were never short on cultivation materials; mid-grade and top-grade Essence Crystals were at their fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone showing even a hint of talent was nurtured with immense care, with Ultimate Essence Crystals readily available. Those exhibiting exceptional talent could even obtain Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that the average strength of a Paramount Supreme Clan member far exceeded that of any other race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of their billion members, at least half were above the Transcendent Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over 100 million had reached the Celestial Deity realm, and at least 30 million had attained the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Close to a million had even managed to break through to the Deity King realm. In terms of raw power, the Paramount Supreme Clan was undoubtedly the foremost race in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their dominance wasn't solely based on strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also due to Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer intimidation factor of Lord Malevolence surpassed that of all one billion members of the Paramount Supreme Clan combined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne delved deeper into Hubery's memories, he stumbled upon some intriguing details regarding Lord Malevolence's power. Although the information wasn't exhaustive, it offered a glimpse into the sheer scale of Lord Malevolence's might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exclaimed, his mind racing, "Lord Malevolence once summoned tens of millions of Dark Undeads!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Level Seven Undead Cataclysm can summon up to a million Dark Undeads. Level Eight can summon up to 10 million, while Level Nine can bring forth a staggering 10 million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Lord Malevolence summoned tens of millions of Dark Undeads in one go, that means his Undead Cataclysm is at least Level Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And given his strength, every Dark Undead he summoned must be at least mid-stage Deity King, if not late-stage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but gasp, the weight of his realization crashing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "So, Lord Malevolence alone can summon 100 million Dark Undeads, each at mid to even late Deity King strength?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to him, the power of the Paramount Supreme Clan seems utterly insignificant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community, he could wipe out the entire Human Community by himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder, a thousand years ago, when Lord Malevolence first descended upon Celestara, he nearly brought the Human Community to extinction, killing off ninety percent of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's just that formidable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grave expression settled on Osborne's face. He had always known Lord Malevolence was powerful, but this level of strength was beyond anything he had imagined. It was utterly despairing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, his determination flickering to life, "Thank goodness for the Seven Great Deity Kings, thank goodness for the God of Night...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But one day, I'll be just as strong as Lord Malevolence, maybe even stronger! A Level Nine Undead Cataclysm? I'm already at Level Seven, and I'll reach Level Nine one day! Even Level Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that day comes, I'll show Lord Malevolence what it feels like to be crushed by endless Dark Undeads!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought fueling him, Osborne pushed aside his shock and dove back into Hubery's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a short while, he finally stumbled upon the secret that could determine the fate of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he processed the information, his expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, "The Baxter family? The Faulkner family? The Baxter and Faulkner families&mdash;two of the ten great families of the Human Community&mdash;have betrayed us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're plotting to take down the God of Light?!"</span></p></div>
