        <h1>Chapter 1674 Huge Strides</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After grasping the Eclipse of Eternity, Osborne felt little excitement. Instead, a heavy gravity settled over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he truly understood the terrifying power of Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I break through to the Deity King realm and unleash Eclipse of Eternity with all my might, I could only cover an area of about 30 thousand miles in eternal night. And that's barely a fraction of what Lord Malevolence can do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's just too formidable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath, pushing aside thoughts of Lord Malevolence for the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Undead Cataclysm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned his attention to the second dark power technique. This unique ability allowed him to summon Dark Undead, creating an army of the undead to fight on his behalf. The strength and number of these Dark Undeads depended on the level of the Undead Cataclysm and his soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The higher the level of Undead Cataclysm, the more Dark Undeads I can summon, and the stronger they become based on my soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Level One, I can only summon one Dark Undead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Level Two</span><span>, I can summon </span><span>10</span><span> Dark Undead</span><span>s</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Level Three</span><span>, I can summon </span><span>100</span><span> Dark Undead</span><span>s</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I reach Level Nine, I could summon a staggering 100 million Dark Undeads!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My soul power is exceptionally strong, far exceeding what's typical for my current realm, even rivaling that of a standard Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wonder what level my summoned Dark Undead will reach and how much power they'll possess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement bubbled within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that Undead Cataclysm could rival his Spatial Clone, and in some ways, it might even be more powerful. Once he leveled it up, the number of Dark Undead</span><span>s</span><span> he could summon would be </span><span>big!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just imagine if I could get Undead Cataclysm to Level Nine. Summoning 100 million Dark Undeads would unleash catastrophic destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if each Dark Undead only had a fraction of my power, they would still be incredibly fearsome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took another deep breath, trying to calm the thrill racing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, at Level One, I can only summon one Dark Undead. At such a low level, it's nearly useless. I need to reach at least Level Five to summon a thousand</span><span>, and </span><span>then we'll really see some action. I have to level this up as quickly as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, he turned his focus to the last dark power</span><span>, </span><span>Abyssal Spear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he understood its effects, his eyes lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne had an offensive technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abyssal Spear allowed him to condense terrifying dark energy into a spear that could strike enemies with incredible speed, unleashing devastating power with formidable tearing and piercing capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the pinnacle of attack techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he hadn't tested the power of Abyssal Spear yet, just a brief understanding convinced him that it surpassed his previous ability, Space Collapse, making it his strongest attack to date.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Awesome! I finally have a new attack technique. With Abyssal Spear, I can finally threaten a Deity King warrior! If they're not careful, they'll definitely get pierced by i</span><span>t. T</span><span>his could be my ultimate trump card!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atop Divine Peak Nine, his comprehension was amplified a hundredfold, allowing him to swiftly master Eclipse of Eternity, Undead Cataclysm, and Abyssal Spear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a day, he had brought Eclipse of Eternity and Abyssal Spear to an initiate mastery level, while Undead Cataclysm had jumped straight to Level Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Level Three, he could summon up to one thousand Dark Undeads to fight for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! You're finally awake! If you hadn't woken up soon, I would've had to wake you myself. I was starting to think you'd fallen into a trance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana saw Osborne awaken, relief washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied with a faint smile, "I'm fine. My soul power is strong enough, so the illusions here can't affect me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded, and her excitement bubbled to the surface. "So, how are you feeling? With those two Miracle Elixirs, I bet your strength has taken a significant leap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, excitement blossomed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've made huge strides!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power had surged from the mid-Celestial Deity realm directly to the early Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a massive leap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coupled with the breakthrough in dark elemental essence, which had granted him three potent new abilities, Osborne felt confident that he could easily defeat the version of himself from just a day before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I wonder how I stack up against Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I decided to test the strength of my new Dark Undead," he mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With focused intent, Osborne invoked the Undead Cataclysm, summoning forth a Dark Undead to gauge its abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark energy swirled and coalesced behind him, forming a shadowy figure that pulsed with an eerie power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's instincts kicked in, and she tensed, ready for anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reassured her, "Don't worry. This is my Dark Undead. It obeys my commands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you give it a try and test its strength, Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes lit up at the suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure!"</span></p></div>
