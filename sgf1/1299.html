        <h1>Chapter 1298 The Slaughter of the Transcendent Deity</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Transcendent Deity warrior, this fighter boasted incredible reflexes. Sensing a threat behind him, he instinctively lunged forward, desperate to evade the impending attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne delivered a brutal kick to his back, a force so powerful it shattered his divine power defenses and erupted within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Explosive Force that Isa had taught him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy detonated inside the Transcendent Deity warrior, causing him to spew blood and turn ghostly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it not been for his Level Four Divine Body and exceptional vitality, he would have already met his end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, this Transcendent Deity was severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that he caught sight of his assailant&mdash;Osborne, the very embodiment of menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smirk, Osborne flickered again, appearing right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne employed Temporal Stasis!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan warrior felt a flash of light before Osborne materialized before him. By the time he comprehended the situation, Osborne's foot had already collided with his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no time to dodge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately for him, Osborne's kick lacked full force since he couldn't hold time in place for long; he hadn't had the chance to channel his full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While this blow wouldn't pierce the warrior's defenses or Divine Body, it was enough to send him flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan warrior was caught completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger and confusion surged within him, but as he tried to retaliate, he was horrified to find himself surrounded by Blood Demon members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit him like a ton of bricks. He knew all too well the fate that awaited him now. Ignoring his injuries, the Deschanel Clan warrior unleashed a desperate surge of power, attempting to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was trapped by the Blood Demon members, every struggle felt like flailing in quicksand. They had no intention of letting him escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they had him encircled, they unleashed a barrage of attacks that quickly overwhelmed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His screams echoed through the void, and within moments, the combined firepower of Blood Demon members shattered his defenses, reducing his Divine Body to a mangled mass of flesh and blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched with satisfaction, a grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The synergy between the Blood Demon members and himself was impeccable. The moment he struck, a portion of the Blood Demon warriors had already shifted into position, closing in on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they arrived, Osborne had just kicked the Deschanel Clan warrior right into their midst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From there, the rest was a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a Transcendent Deity stood no chance of escape when surrounded by a thousand Blood Demon members. The outcome was a foregone conclusion&mdash;he would be hunted down and slaughtered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One down!" Osborne murmured, already plotting his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, he could have taken out the Deschanel Clan Transcendent Deity on his own, but it wouldn't have been easy. He had to unleash his full power while also keeping an eye out for any potential interference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Deschanel Clan warrior managed to hold out and call for reinforcements, Osborne would be in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, working in tandem with the Blood Demon members made the hunt significantly easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even need to finish off the Deschanel Clan warrior himself; all Osborne had to do was injure him, kick him toward the Blood Demon members, or simply stall for time until they could complete the encirclement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it would all be over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, pulling off such a feat was a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Divine Shadow and God of Star could handle it with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given their strength, taking down a Deschanel Clan Transcendent Deity would ordinarily take time, and getting surrounded could put them in jeopardy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with the Blood Demon members backing them up, they felt completely at ease. Even if they faced multiple Deschanel Clan warriors at once, they could hold their ground for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the Blood Demon members made their presence known, the Deschanel Clan Transcendent Deities would scatter like leaves in the wind, unable to press the attack effectively. As the enemies fled, Divine Shadow and God of Star would unleash their full power, ensnaring one or two of them in the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those few captured Deschanel Clan Transcendent Deities would ultimately meet their doom, overwhelmed by the concentrated fire of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intense battles erupted across the ocean as the might of the Blood Demon was unleashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, Divine Shadow, and God of Star quickly joined forces with the Blood Demon members, delivering powerful blows to the Deschanel Clan Transcendent Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the Deschanel Clan's Transcendent Deities finally realized what was happening and managed to break free from the melee&mdash;retreating to a safe distance&mdash;their ranks had dwindled to just sixteen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleven of their Transcendent Deity members had fallen, never to rise again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slaughter carried out by Junior and Intermediate Deities against Transcendent Deity warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the fighting suddenly ceased, and Osborne assessed the aftermath, he couldn't help but feel a wave of shock wash over him.</span></p></div>
