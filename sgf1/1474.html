        <h1>Chapter 1473 Central Figure</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't expected that the five thousand war prisoners from the West Zone would come at such a low price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had braced himself for a serious financial hit, yet after an intense bidding war, all he had to cough up was a mere three million low-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly ran the numbers in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he had taken one million mid-grade Essence Crystals from his Dimensional Space and stuffed them into his Dimensional Bag. At the slave market, one million mid-grade Crystals could be exchanged for a whopping 120 million low-grade Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, he'd spent a staggering 116 million low-grade Crystals buying 256 human slaves at the auction. That meant he still had four million low-grade Crystals left in his Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, grinning to himself, "Those people around here probably think I stumbled upon some ancient god's treasure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They must be guessing how many Essence Crystals I really have."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Many of them are likely already plotting to ambush me, given how money can make folks greedy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I better blow through these Crystals and make them think I'm tapped out; that way, I'll have a lot less hassle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne raised his bidding paddle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>F</span><span>our million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd shot him angry glares but reluctantly fell silent, realizing what he'd just done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne was known as the lucky guy who had hit the jackpot in that mythical treasure hunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bidding against him seemed like a fool's errand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why bother? It's just a bunch of crippled humans; what's the point of spending all that on them? They might've been warriors once, but now they're just a burden.</span><span> </span><span>Feeding them would be a waste of resources! Let the human have them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly my thoughts! Just a bunch of useless wrecks; keeping them alive is just prolonging their misery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, just as Osborne had anticipated, no one dared to contest him any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auctioneer called out, "The current bid stands at four million! Is there anyone else willing to counter? Four million, once... twice... three times... sold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the gavel fell, a wave of relief washed over Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had managed to snag the last batch of captives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this final purchase, the auction came to a close, and he stood out as the central figure, having boldly spent 120 million low-grade Essence Crystals while everyone else faded into the background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd, now standing, cast him looks filled with envy, anger, and greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he doesn't meet his end at Fabian's hands, I swear I'll find a way to get him! Who does he think he is, throwing money around like that? His Dimensional Bag must be stuffed with Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just imagine snagging that bag! It'd be a goldmine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry; he's been tossed out by the Swift family. Without their protection, we could make our move. Let's just hope he dodges Fabian long enough to give us a shot at that bag..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they exchanged dark smiles, plotting Osborne's downfall, he simply chuckled to himself and tossed his Dimensional Bag to Tiana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Tiana Hart, I dropped a neat 120 million low-grade Essence Crystals at this auction, right? The funny thing is, my Dimensional Bag only holds a million mid-grade Essence Crystals. Perfectly enough to settle my bill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone had dared to bid against me just a tad longer, I might not have had enough to snag that last batch of slaves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please count them. Just return the Dimensional Bag to me later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana blinked in surprise, and the crowd fell silent, their astonishment palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "What did he mean? He only has one million mid-grade Essence Crystals in his Dimensional Bag?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And he's wiped out all his funds?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He even tossed his Dimensional Bag to Tiana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's out of cash?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd shifted uncomfortably, a mix of disbelief and annoyance washing over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Tiana smiled, "No need to check! This Dimensional Bag does indeed hold exactly one million mid-grade Essence Crystals. Adding the previous amounts, just as per our exchange rate, it comes exactly to 120 million low-grade Essence Crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tiana pulled out her own Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She proceeded to pour all the Essence Crystals from Osborne's Dimensional Bag into hers, ensuring it was completely emptied before handing it back to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our transaction's all squared away! Mr. Lachlan Swift, you can now head backstage to collect the slaves you've just bought!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished speaking, an audible murmur rippled through the crowd, their discomfort palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's really out of money! What a waste! He's sitting on a mountain of Essence Crystals and didn't hold back, splurging on all those slaves like a fool!" one man hissed, shaking his head in disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder the Swift family kicked him to the curb!" another added, bitterness lacing his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe he knows Fabian has set his sights on him and figured he won't be around much longer. So he decided to blow his cash, rather than let it fall into Fabian's hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget about that loser; let's get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the whispers behind him, Osborne followed Tiana back to the slave market's backstage area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His curiosity bubbled up. Osborne couldn't wait to see what kind of mysterious slave he'd bought for 30 million low-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p></div>
