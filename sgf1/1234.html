        <h1>Chapter 1233 Grandma Divine Shadow</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow's voice sent Osborne's mind reeling. He stood there, tongue-tied, his mind scrambling to process her revelations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His encounters with her had been limited yet significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She often leaped onto his shoulder or into his arms, behaving like an ordinary cat, never once speaking a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew all too well that Divine Shadow was anything but ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, what common cat could live for hundreds of years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What cat could rescue Anastasia and Zoe from Gerardo's clutches?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Osborne had merely thought of Divine Shadow as a cat with a bit of spirit. He had never imagined she could actually talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, hearing her voice&mdash;a distinctly feminine tone&mdash;sent a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Your Holiness, Sublime Saintess Mila? Looks like the Ms. Divine Shadow Mila mentioned really is Divine Shadow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way Divine Shadow addressed Mila left him utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Holiness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not a title just anyone can bear! I must be right; Mila's identity is extraordinary.</span><span> </span><span>Even in the Age of Gods, her background must be incredibly deep!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her parents... they could very well be Deity King warriors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts swirled in his mind, Divine Shadow sprang forward, her body light as a feather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mid-air, she transformed swiftly, morphing into a stunning woman in her twenties, clad in a sleek black outfit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her figure was mesmerizing, and her eyes glistened with tears as she rushed to Mila, pulling Mila into a tight embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sublime Saintess, I've finally found you again! You're alive&mdash;thank the heavens!" Divine Shadow exclaimed, holding Mila close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila's eyes brimmed with tears as she hugged Divine Shadow back, her voice choked with emotion. "Ms. Divine Shadow, you're alive too! I'm so relieved! I missed you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them clung to each other, weeping for what felt like an eternity, their bond evident enough to even touch Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he noticed something peculiar&mdash;Divine Shadow had no Divine Flame above her head!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "That's strange! From what Mila said, Divine Shadow should be incredibly powerful! After all, Mila's parents entrusted her to Divine Shadow for protection in the east."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They faced the Deschanel Clan patriarch, Terrence, and while Mila was captured, Divine Shadow managed to escape! Terrence is a top-tier Deity Overlord, so for Divine Shadow to slip away from him, she must be formidable herself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, based on my speculation, Divine Shadow's strength must be greater than Mila's and just slightly weaker than Terrence's. This means she should be a Deity Overlord as well... But the thing is, she doesn't have a Divine Flame, which is weird."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced as he scrutinized Divine Shadow's head, trying every trick he knew to catch a glimpse of her Divine Flame, but to no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Divine Shadow took Mila's hand and turned her gaze toward Osborne, her expression softening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what are you staring at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh?" Osborne snapped back to reality, his face flushing with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you return to your original appearance? You look a bit odd like this," Divine Shadow said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Osborne remember he was still in disguise. His facial muscles contorted for a moment before he reverted to his true form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila's eyes widened with delight. "Mister, you're actually really handsome! What should I call you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled gently, "Just call me Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned back to Divine Shadow, curiosity etched on his face. "Ms. Divine Shadow..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call me Grandma Divine Shadow!" she interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, staring at her in disbelief. Here Divine Shadow was, looking like a woman in her twenties, and she wanted him to call her "Grandma"! He couldn't bring himself to say it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow continued, "You know, I'm way older than your grandfather! Back in the Age of Gods, my master sensed that Lord Malevolence was about to invade, and Celestara was on the brink of destruction. He told me to take Sublime Saintess and flee east in search of safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But then we got attacked by the Deschanel Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their leader, Terrence, is a top-tier Deity Overlord warrior, and I was no match for him. In the end, I was defeated, and Saintess was captured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was left severely injured and fell into a deep sleep. It wasn't until over three hundred years ago that I woke up at Mount Celestial Reach. I was confused; my memories were gone, and my powers hadn't returned&mdash;I was like a wild cat trying to survive in a strange place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, eighty years ago, your grandfather Sebastian was born. He took me in as a pet, and for some reason, my memories began to come back while I was with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I spent those eighty years by his side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Divine Shadow's cheeks flushed slightly before she quickly regained her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't lost on Osborne, who was now staring at her wide-eyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed there was something deeper between Divine Shadow and his grandfather, Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow continued, "Osborne, your grandfather always treated me like a friend... like family! So, isn't it only right for you to call me Grandma Divine Shadow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found her logic hard to argue with.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he finally managed to say, "Grandma Divine Shadow..."</span></p></div>
