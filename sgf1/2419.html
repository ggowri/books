        <h1>Chapter 2332 A Series of Battles-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the Sacred Power arrow effortlessly shattered Benson's defenses and pierced through his shoulder, sending him crashing back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson sprayed blood on the ground, a look of bewilderment in his eyes as he lay there, staring blankly upwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had lost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a grueling five minutes, he faced defeat&mdash;not just in terms of losing, but in the profound despair he'd felt during the confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't merely regret; it was a crushing sense of hopelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he realized this defeat felt more like a release than a despairing loss, far worse than his earlier defeat against Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're toast!" Osborne's voice rang out through the stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson stirred a bit and slowly sat up. His eyes locked onto Osborne, a maelstrom of emotions swirling in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long beat, he yanked off his chest badge and chucked it at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm beat! I throw in the towel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wince, he continued, "So Agatha was talking about you, huh? She tracked us down and took us out because she decided we weren't worth her time anymore, all thanks to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arched an eyebrow. "Did Agatha really say that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson nodded with a wry smile on his face. "It's a real kick in the teeth. Before the state duel started, I thought I was untouchable, that I could take on anyone. And here I am, getting my butt kicked twice in a row... what a humiliation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One at the hands of Agatha and the other, a grueling contest against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Benson's eyes, Agatha still emerged as the stronger fighter. However, he had to admit that if anyone had a shot at challenging her, it might just be Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, even Horace had bitten the dust. Agatha's score was creeping close to 11 million. At this point, the only one who could still pose a threat to Agatha was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned forward, eyes blazing with determination. "Osborne, do me a favor. Help us take down Agatha!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The state duel champion can't end up being a woman! We can't let a woman stand above all us men!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh at that sentiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Clara and Leroy shot him angry looks. "What's wrong with women? Why can't a woman win the championship? Your thinking is pretty outdated! Isn't it funny that you, a disciple of the Resurgent Throne Palace, are rooting for Osborne instead of Agatha winning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson merely sighed, not bothering to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a new figure emerged from the distance, bringing with him an aura of threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Broderick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he spotted Benson sprawled on the ground and Osborne clutching his chest badge, Broderick came to a sudden halt, his face etched with utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick asked with a frown, "Benson, what in the world is going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson managed to pull himself up and shot a quick look at Broderick. "Look for yourself. I got clobbered. I lost to Osborne! You're just in the nick of time 'cause I've got a sneaking suspicion you're the next one up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick's eyes nearly popped out in shock. "You lost? One-on-one? Or was it a three-on-one situation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had to be multiple opponents ganging up on Benson for him to lose; that was the only thing that added up. After all, Broderick reckoned he was a smidge stronger than Benson, but it was a close call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he couldn't bank on winning a one-on-one bout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Benson had been defeated by three opponents ganging up on him, Broderick thought he might have a shot at taking them on one by one and emerging victorious in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, Benson's next words blew his hopes sky-high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One-on-one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick let out a deep breath and sized Osborne up. His expression was grim because he knew that Benson wouldn't pull the wool over his eyes on this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, Osborne's better than Benson?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a bitter pill to swallow, but instead of backing off like a coward, Broderick's fighting spirit went through the roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this! Just because you took down Benson doesn't mean you can take me out! If you wanna prove yourself to me, you gotta fight me straight up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Broderick charged forward, itching for a scrap.</span></p></div>
