        <h1>Chapter 1902 Spatial Oblivion Slash</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne dedicated three months to mastering the Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes, but in the accelerated time of Hope Haven, that felt like a mere blink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While three months passed in Hope Haven, outside, it was barely a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Returning to his secluded training area, he focused on enhancing his space and lightning elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drawing from his experience with the dark elemental essence, Osborne managed to transform his space elemental essence to Level Nine in just one month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he broke through, Hope Haven trembled violently. Everyone felt a disorienting shift in time and space, as if the very fabric of reality was fracturing and mending like a set of tumbling blocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others were jolted from their routines, rushing outside to see what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, however, they kept their distance, wary of the previous chaos caused by the Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Spatial Oblivion Slash!" Osborne whispered, and in an instant, a terrifying Dimensional Razor shot forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's astonishment, it vanished from sight, only to reappear hundreds of miles away, then blink out again, reappearing further still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and the others stared, wide-eyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was just the beginning. The massive Dimensional Razor began to flicker throughout Hope Haven, becoming increasingly agile. It darted around them in rapid succession, appearing in front, behind, to the left, and then right above their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, every muscle in Anastasia's body tensed. They activated every defensive measure available, fearing that this colossal Dimensional Razor might inadvertently slice through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt that even clad in Ultimate Luminous Armor, it might not be enough to withstand the razor's edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dimensional Razor performed a dazzling display, flashing around for a full ten minutes before hundreds of massive Dimensional Razors filled the skies above Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their speed slowed as if Osborne was exerting control, albeit with some difficulty. The distant razors occasionally collided with objects, and whatever they touched was utterly obliterated, vanishing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and the others gasped, chills running down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if those disintegrated entities were their own bodies, sending waves of dread through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They feared that Osborne might lose control and let a Dimensional Razor fall upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, that calamity did not occur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The multitude of razors soon dissipated, and Osborne approached with a satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he had anticipated, his breakthrough in space elemental essence had indeed granted him another Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Spatial Oblivion Slash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, learning from his earlier experience with the Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes, he didn't unleash the full force of the Spatial Oblivion Slash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he first summoned a single Dimensional Razor, which he controlled with precision, allowing it to traverse through space effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the presence of a Dimensional Razor, distance became meaningless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, evasion was nearly impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The razor's speed was astonishing, flashing from hundreds of miles away to right in front of an enemy in the blink of an eye, or appearing just behind them before launching a rapid attack. No matter how quick one's reflexes, dodging was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only option was to defend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne believed that such a Dimensional Razor would be beyond the capability of any being below the rank of Supernal Deity King to withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The attack power of my Dimensional Razor is just as formidable as Trevor's Ice Blade! Plus, with the Spatial Oblivion Slash, it's an area-of-effect attack. Just like the Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes, as long as my control is strong enough, I can unleash a swarm of Dimensional Razors to annihilate everything living within the radius!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne beamed with satisfaction at his achievements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally made his way over to the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was the first to speak up, a playful frown on his face, "Osborne! Being around you while you train feels too risky! I just know you're going to accidentally take me out one of these days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the complaint, joy and envy sparkled in Bryce's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strength had taken another leap forward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone understood without needing to be told&mdash;it was clear that Osborne's space elemental essence had broken through to Level Nine. The dramatic energy fluctuations and the terrifying display of Dimensional Razors confirmed it. Osborne had unlocked another Divine Ascendance Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two Divine Ascendance Techniques!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many Supernal Deity Kings were lucky to have just one, while Osborne was only well into the advanced Deity King Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Possessing two Divine Ascendance Techniques was nothing short of astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose in modesty, feeling a bit sheepish. "Sorry for scaring you guys! I just couldn't help myself. I had to test it out. Next time, I'll..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his sentence, his expression shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wore an odd look. "I think I might be about to break through again..."</span></p></div>
