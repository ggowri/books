        <h1>Chapter 2180 Chaotic Spiritual Root-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed the World Tree fragment had fully melded with his bones, and his body had gotten a major power-up. His body was already an Infinite Sacred Body. After this upgrade, Osborne didn't have a clue how beefed-up he'd become.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial let out a scoff. "Punch a little planet to smithereens?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that's a walk in the park for you now! Your body's meshed so well with that World Tree fragment that you're now in the middle of the Infinite Sacred Body! Your physical strength? It's at least reached the Myriadfold Dragon Might! If you throw a punch with that Myriadfold Dragon Might, even a Supernal Deity King at the Ascension Ten stage is toast if they don't put up a good defense. Blowing up a tiny planet? Piece of cake."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's words dripped with envy, but Osborne was over the moon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Myriadfold Dragon Might? No way, it's that strong?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that the Sacred Dragon Clan was the apple of this cosmos' eye. Their babies popped out with crazy power, making them one of the top dogs when it came to raw physical strength in this cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myriadfold Dragon Might was a staggering hundred times greater than what a Sacred Dragon Clan member was born with&mdash;an unfathomable strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for a Supernal Deity King at the Ascension Ten stage, it would be quite an achievement if they could unleash an all-out attack reaching the level of Myriadfold Dragon Might. Those who could surpass this level were undoubtedly the most extraordinary and gifted prodigies.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before fusing with that World Tree fragment, Osborne's physical strength probably didn't even reach the Hundredfold Dragon Might. Yet now, it had soared to the Myriadfold Dragon Might!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an increase of over a hundred times!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne could unleash the Myriadfold Dragon Might with just his physical body alone. How could he not be overjoyed?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just this newfound physical strength, Osborne could go toe-to-toe with a top-tier Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amazing!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne continued to explore the changes in his body, he quickly realized that the benefits of merging with the World Tree fragment extended far beyond just physical power.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he noticed shadowy, root-like tendrils stretching from his form.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this?!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Osborne thought they might be the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, but he quickly dismissed that notion. The Lotus' roots were blood-red, while these were a vibrant emerald green.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial chimed in, his voice tinged with envy, "Those are the Chaotic Spiritual Roots.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think your physical boost is impressive? It's nothing compared to the Chaotic Spiritual Roots you've obtained. I'm actually a bit jealous of you now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's confusion deepened. "What's so special about Chaotic Spiritual Roots?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial grunted and said, "It's extremely useful!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've merged with that fragment of the World Tree perfectly, so you've gained some of the World Tree's abilities. From the looks of it, what you've got is the Chaotic Spiritual Root!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chaotic Spiritual Root can take root anywhere and absorb power at an astonishing speed to restore your power! It doesn't just restore your divine power. It can also restore your Sacred Power, soul power, elemental power, and even the power of your physical body. As long as you have the Chaotic Spiritual Root, all these can be quickly restored!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Chaotic Spiritual Root, you'll never have to worry about running out of power again! No matter who you're fighting against, you can go all-out without a second thought. You can even use your trump cards as regular attacks... 'Cause you'll never run out of steam!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless all the power in this cosmos is exhausted, the Chaotic Spiritual Root can devour power and help you recover quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's voice turned bitter. "This is one of the World Tree's most core abilities. And here you are, getting it before me. It's just not fair. Come on! I'm the World Tree's offshoot, not you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed, sulking in frustration.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, couldn't care less about Primordial's envy. His heart raced as he processed the implications of the Chaotic Spiritual Roots.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">With the Chaotic Spiritual Roots, I don't have to worry about running out of power? I can use my trump cards freely? Anything can be restored?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I transform into my second form&mdash;the crimson lotus form&mdash;and use absolute defense, I'll never have to worry about exhausting my power again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I could maintain absolute defense forever, which would make me untouchable by anyone's attacks!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought left Osborne breathless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could bask in his excitement, he suddenly felt a surge of energy coursing through him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation level was skyrocketing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm about to break through to Ascension Four! The Deity King Tribulation is coming!"</span></p></div>
