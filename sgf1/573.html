        <h1>Chapter 573 Picking Up the Fight</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle with Owen was unavoidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne didn't face him, everyone would think he was scared. His sister had been beaten by Owen, and if he remained silent and didn't seek revenge, it would be a clear sign of weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a fellow heir, Osborne would forever be overshadowed by Owen, and people would look down on him for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's anger was like a raging fire, almost impossible to control. He wanted nothing more than to march straight to Owen's door, challenge him to a duel on Challenge Peak, and smash his arrogance to pieces, all to avenge Yulissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of acting impulsively, Osborne decided to wait a few more days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye was close to reaching level six. Just a couple more days of absorbing star power, and he'd be there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that added strength, he'd have a much better chance of winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his fury needed an outlet. He was about to explode if he didn't do something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice was icy as he asked, "Isaac, since Dampston won first place in Branch Bloodline Competition, we get to pick our residence first, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was caught off guard by the question but nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. As the champions, we have the first pick among the ten estates on Mount Seven. Traditionally, the winners choose First Estate at the top of the mountain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac frowned, sensing something was up. "You're not thinking of moving into First Estate, are you? That might be tricky. I don't think Yalynch will give it up easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though we have the right to choose First Estate, their strength far exceeds ours. If they refuse, there's not much we can do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's lips curled into a cold smile. "First Estate at the top? I'm not interested. What I want is Third Estate, the one Ransford is currently occupying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Third Estate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was astonished. "You're planning to go after Ransford? They're much stronger than us. I don't think they'll hand it over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, a dangerous glint in his eyes. "Of course they won't. That's exactly what I'm counting on. If they refuse, it gives me the perfect excuse to make my move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac stared at him, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're seriously planning to start a fight with Ransford?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice was laced with cold determination. "They had a hand in bullying Yulissa. Do you think I'm going to let them walk away unscathed? Go and tell Ransford that we want the Third Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They'd better pack up and leave by tomorrow morning, or they'll be facing the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After delivering his icy ultimatum, Osborne turned and left, while Isaac sucked in a sharp breath, his brow deeply furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Osborne's anger had to be released. Compared to challenging Owen, going to war with Ransford seemed a better option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It offered a slightly better chance of success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll notify Ransford immediately. This is our right, after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded slightly. "I'm off to cultivate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he reached out and gently ruffled Yulissa's hair. Her face was still wet with tears, but her eyes glistened with deep emotion and gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest and recover. I'll make sure you get your revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, Ransford, and then Owen. None of them will escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with that, Osborne returned to his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made his way to the rooftop, settling into a meditative pose as he looked up at the vast, starry sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, letting the energy of the stars flow into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the fifth day of his star absorption, and he was close to a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just two more days and the sixth star would ignite in his vision, marking the evolution of his Satan's Eye to the next level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When that happened, his power would surge, placing him among the strongest, right up there with Vincent, Matthew, Owen, and even Godfather himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this newfound strength, Osborne was confident he could finally face Owen and crush him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, once Godfather's birthday banquet is over, it'll be time for our battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dared to strike Yulissa. I'll make sure you pay for that a hundred times over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he whispered these words, Osborne's gaze sharpened, drawing in the star power from all around him. His Satan's Eye absorbed it all, and instantly, a layer of frost formed on his skin, encasing him in an icy shell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But inside, his strength was growing rapidly, both his body and soul becoming more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Isaac had reached Ransford's Third Estate, as Osborne had instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was met by the elder of Ransford, Larry Augustine, who looked at him with a cold, mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want us to vacate Third Estate for you? And you expect us to do it by tomorrow morning? Are you out of your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac remained unfazed. "We won first place in the competition. By the rules, we have the right to claim the Third Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're supposed to move out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Larry's laughter echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First place, huh? And you think that gives you the power to kick us out? We're not going anywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want Third Estate, you'll have to take it by force."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rest of Ransford joined in, their eyes filled with ridicule as they looked at Isaac.</span></p></div>
