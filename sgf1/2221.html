        <h1>Chapter 2201 It's Over-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four maidens and one guard sacrificed their lives in the line of duty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consumed by grief, the God of Night retreated to the Court of the Sun, vowing to stay out of Celestara Planet's affairs from then on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, his body was plagued by a mysterious and dark ailment that worsened with each passing day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in a desperate race against time to find a cure, knowing that only by doing so could he continue to push beyond his limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the years rolled on, his search for a remedy proved fruitless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Celestara Planet began to undergo a series of bizarre transformations. Forty-two divine peaks suddenly erupted from the ground, and an endless horde of Deathborn emerged from these peaks. To everyone's shock, they unexpectedly shattered the seal that had imprisoned Lord Malevolence, setting him free once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the war reignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the God of Night's strength had waned. He could no longer defeat Lord Malevolence or seal him away; he could only barely hold his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Lord Malevolence began to gain the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion, under Lord Malevolence's command, launched relentless assaults across Celestara Planet, eventually driving the Human Community back to the West Zone, where they struggled to survive. Most of the territory was now under Lord Malevolence's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suffering of the Human Community had truly begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, over twenty years ago, the God of Night had a sudden premonition&mdash;Lord Malevolence's cultivation level was on the verge of a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To finally put an end to him, the God of Night chose to undertake a perilous gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He transferred all of his powers to Isa, preserving his memories within her, and without hesitation, he entered the cycle of reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, in a corner of Blue Planet, Osborne was born!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, standing before Lord Malevolence, Osborne, as the reincarnation of the God of Night, had completely defeated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's finally over!" Osborne exhaled deeply, a broad smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, there was no chance of Lord Malevolence returning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without their leader, the Dark Deity Legion was left disoriented. Despite their numbers, all that awaited them was reckoning&mdash;either submission to the Human Community, death, or a desperate flight from Celestara Planet to wander aimlessly in the cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter the outcome, the Human Community would reclaim their dominion, and their suffering would come to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa approached Osborne, her presence a comforting warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and others&mdash;Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Kendra&mdash;gathered around him, their eyes shimmering with tears of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over!" Osborne repeated, his smile radiant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded vigorously, their faces lighting up with beautiful smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! It's over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We won!" Isa exclaimed, taking Osborne's hand, her expression a mix of tenderness and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa quickly grabbed Osborne's other hand, matching Isa's gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing both of his hands held, Emma and Austin exchanged glances before leaping into Osborne's embrace, holding him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Zoe watched the scene unfold, giggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, the God of Light emerged from the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. As she saw Osborne surrounded by the women, a look of envy crossed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Further away, the God of Time stood on the deck of the Sanctum of Night. She shifted her feet several times, as if wanting to approach Osborne, but ultimately remained rooted to the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her feet felt heavy, as if weighed down by tens of millions of pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at Osborne, her eyes filled with regret and sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once been his wife. As the reincarnation of the God of Night, he had fulfilled his promise by marrying her first, but she had made a grave mistake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have ever guessed that the once-penniless and powerless Osborne was, in fact, the reincarnation of the God of Night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right at this moment, the Human Alliance was rejoicing in their hard-won victory, while the Dark Deity Legion was drowning in despair and descending into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of this commotion could reach Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced tenderly at Isa and Clarissa standing beside him, then looked down at Emma and Austin nestled in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of the people he held dearest still alive filled his heart with an overwhelming sense of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Isa's voice cut through the moment of bliss. "Osborne, what's our plan for the Dark Deity Legion? And what about the Paramount Supreme Clan? And all those factions under Lord Malevolence&mdash;what should we do with them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, it seems some of the allies Lord Malevolence summoned managed to slip away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should we go after them?"</span></p></div>
