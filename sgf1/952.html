        <h1>Chapter 952 Brutal Massacre</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George looked at Osborne with a mocking grin, his eyes glinting with malice. "Even </span><span>if you don't hide, in twenty-nine minutes, if I see you, I'll kill one of them! And they'll die because of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just one every half hour, and by the end of the day, I could wipe them all out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not afraid of physical pain? Then let's play a different game! Imagine watching them die because of you. How do you think that'll feel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his desire to kill George surged to its peak. If it weren't for the God Binding Rope sealing his powers, he would have obliterated George without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, you want to play games? I'll play along!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne turned and dashed into the jungle, sprinting with a speed that far surpassed any ordinary human, like a wild animal, even with his powers suppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "But this is a lonely island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only a two-mile radius, how can I possibly evade George's search using just my physical abilities? He's just looking for an excuse to kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly found a hollow in a tree and squeezed inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that no matter where he hid, George would inevitably find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, instead of wasting time searching for a better hiding spot, he decided to focus on what truly mattered: finding a way to deal with the God Binding Rope and restoring his powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne needed to regain his strength to confront George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wrath boiled within him as he tried to reach out to the Blood Cross inside him, seeking a connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this state of fury, he felt the Blood Cross pulse with intensity, as if it, too, was eager to break free from the God-Binding Rope's grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of hope ignited in Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as half an hour slipped by, he realized he still couldn't connect with the Blood Cross. Breaking free from the God Binding Rope was proving more difficult than he'd anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, he feared it might be impossible for him to escape within five days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, George appeared nearby, dragging a member of the Draco Armed Services Branch behind him, a sneer plastered across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached the tree hollow slowly, his gaze fixed on Osborne with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Found you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiding in a place like this? Are you looking down on me? Or do you think I'm too scared to kill? Finding you was a piece of cake. You clearly don't care about his life at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you don't care, I guess I'll just send him straight to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, George tightened his grip and, right before Osborne's eyes, slowly twisted the man's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The victim was a Class AAA powerhouse from the Draco Armed Services Branch, with his life force incredibly strong. Even with his neck broken, he didn't die instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger and despair filled his eyes as he realized his fate, the vitality within him slowly fading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glared at George, fists clenched in fury, but felt utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smirked. "Still want to glare at me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're so indifferent, I can't let him die easily! Because of you, he'll die in the most excruciating pain imaginable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a fierce wind whipped around George, swirling at his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gust transformed into countless razor-sharp blades, slicing through the man's flesh like a knife through butter, tearing away pieces of his body until he was nothing but a bloody mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man emitted a low, anguished howl, helpless against the torment. Layer by layer, the gruesome wind blades stripped flesh from his body until, in the agonizing spiral of suffering, he was reduced to nothing but a skeleton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening chuckle, George tossed the bare skeletal remains down at Osborne's feet. "What do you think? Not bad, huh? Before he died, I carved away over eight thousand pieces of flesh using my wind blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next time, I'll aim for 10 thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just the thought of watching his own body being sliced into a thousand pieces&mdash;it would be excruciating! And he suffered this torment all because of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze on Osborne twisted into a sadistic delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes glowed crimson with unparalleled rage, his teeth grinding together so hard they might break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more furious he became, the more excited George seemed to get.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Are you mad? Perfect! That means I'm doing it right! Now, let the game continue!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got another half an hour!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After thirty minutes, I'll come looking for you again. And if I find you, I'll kill another one, cutting their flesh into 10 thousand pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, George threw his head back in genuine laughter and swaggered away, clearly headed back to the cages to fetch another prisoner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glared at his retreating figure, fury radiating from him like a dark cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George, I swear I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared, stepping out of the tree hollow as he prepared to find a more concealed spot to hide, determined not to let George catch him again easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he emerged, however, Osborne felt a sudden shift within him&mdash;the Blood Cross pulsed violently.</span></p></div>
