        <h1>Chapter 1836 Bad News</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne slipped the Thundergod Gloves onto his hands, a surge of energy coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could distinctly feel a connection forming, a tether between the gloves and something deep within Apocalypse City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's definitely the Hammer of Thor!" he murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, Osborne activated his spatial power and materialized at the heart of Apocalypse City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him lay a vast expanse&mdash;a massive lake that resembled a sea more than a mere body of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse City was colossal, a super metropolis housing hundreds of billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At its center was this enormous lake, stretching over 300 miles in diameter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle of the lake sat a beautiful island&mdash;Apocalypse Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The island was shaped like a giant peanut, wider at both ends and tapering in the middle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, the Baxter family and the Hudson family had divided the island between them, but now, the Hudson family had retreated, leaving the Baxter family to occupy the left side of Apocalypse Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his previous experience of being spotted while spying on Jethro, Osborne was careful this time. He kept his distance from Apocalypse Island, cautiously observing the Baxter family from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive divine power barrier enveloped the Baxter family, shielding them from prying eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Baxter family outnumbered the Hudson family significantly, with at least five million people on the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of warriors among them was slightly greater than that of the Hudson family, although the difference wasn't vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for Osborne to spot the Baxter family's Supernal Deity Kings, and what he saw left him stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four Supernal Deity Kings? One Ascension Three Supernal Deity King and three Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings?" His heart raced, and he quickly averted his gaze, fearing they might sense his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascension Three Supernal Deity King had to be Cicero, the head of the Baxter family. "He's definitely stronger than Jethro, the head of the Hudson family! That's why the Baxter family is currently more powerful than the Hudson family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And on top of that, they have three more Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings! Even one of them would put immense pressure on me. At my current strength, I wouldn't stand a chance against them, even if I gave it my all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face grew serious as the reality of the Baxter family's strength hit him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Osborne hadn't come here to pick a fight; he was on a mission to find the Hammer of Thor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is the Hammer of Thor?" he whispered, focusing on the sensations from the Thundergod Gloves as he began his search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Supernal Deity Kings were powerful, as long as he didn't overuse his Satan's Eye to spy on them, they wouldn't be able to detect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, he freely employed his Satan's Eye to locate the Hammer of Thor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was confident that if the Hammer truly was with the Baxter family, he'd be able to find it. Even if it were hidden in a Dimensional Space, it wouldn't escape the reach of his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he found what he was looking for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the look on his face darkened, and he couldn't help but frown deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered to himself, frustration creeping in, "The Hammer of Thor is indeed with the Baxter family! But here's the bad news, it's lying inside a Supernal Deity King's Dimensional Bag!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This complicates things!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Hammer were anywhere else, my spatial power could let me sneak in and swipe it without a sound. Even if I got caught, I'd have a decent shot at making a getaway!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, it's tucked away in a Supernal Deity King's Dimensional Bag. There's no way I can breach that. The only way to get the Hammer is to take him down..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking his head at the thought, Osborne grimaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a Supernal Deity King he was dealing with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even an Ascension One wouldn't be something he could confront head-on in his current state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It looks like I'll have to come up with another plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only silver lining is that the Hammer isn't in Cicero's Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cicero is an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, and if it were with him, I wouldn't stand a chance of getting it anytime soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, there's still a glimmer of hope!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne didn't waste any more time. He quickly returned to the Pioneers of Starlight base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was back in Hope Haven, he filled Anastasia in on the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fell silent, her brow furrowed in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Ascension One Supernal Deity King, huh? Given our current strength, we can't handle that. I guess we'll have to let it go for now," she said, her voice heavy with resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's put the Hammer of Thor on the back burner for now," she added, though Osborne could read the disappointment and impatience etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was eager to get her hands on the Hammer of Thor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just worried about the danger it posed to Osborne, which was why she forced herself to suppress her desire and choose to step back for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't push her further and encouraged Anastasia to continue her training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he turned his thoughts inward, brainstorming ways to quickly acquire the Hammer of Thor and surprise Anastasia.</span></p></div>
