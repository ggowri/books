        <h1>Chapter 2371 Reaching the Limit</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even a hundred Frost-kissed Hearts still couldn't push my body from the mid Sacredness Level to the advanced Sacredness Level," Osborne thought with some regret.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had thought his body could break through to the advanced Sacredness Level. If his body reached the advanced Sacredness Level, both his strength and defense would improve. Even relying solely on physical strength, he could easily handle some ordinary warriors at the primary Empyrean Sacredness level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even ordinary warriors at the mid Sacredness Level would find it hard to break his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, his body did not break through to the advanced Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Maybe if I had about twenty more Frost-kissed Hearts, my body could break through to the advanced Sacredness Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne summoned Primordial. "Primordial, please lend me twenty Frost-kissed Hearts. I will repay you double in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, in the seventh layer of Arctic Maw Chasm, Osborne obtained over 150 Frost-kissed Hearts and gave more than 50 of them to Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wanted to borrow twenty Frost-kissed Hearts to break his body through to the advanced Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could go to the seventh layer of Arctic Maw Chasm again later to get Frost-kissed Hearts and return them </span><span>to</span><span> Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Primordial rolled his eyes and said, "You're too late. I've already absorbed all my Frost-kissed Hearts. I don't have a single one left now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a bit disappointed. "Alright. Then it has nothing to do with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only suppress his disappointment. Although his body hadn't broken through to the advanced Sacredness Level, it was already much stronger than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, his body's strength was dozens of times greater than before absorbing the Frost-kissed Heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the power generated by his physical strength alone was no weaker than the Maw Arrow. That was already quite impressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "The effect of the Frost-kissed Heart in enhancing physical fitness is just a bonus. The most important thing is that the Frost-kissed Heart enables the Fusion Vessel to grow. By the time I absorbed all ten Frost-kissed Hearts, the third foundational carrier on the Fusion Vessel had already fully solidified."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time I absorbed thirty Frost-kissed Hearts, a shadow of the fourth foundational carrier appeared on the Fusion Vessel. And when I absorbed ninety Frost-kissed Hearts, the fourth foundational carrier fully solidified as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, I have two vacant foundational carriers. These two foundational carriers allow me to fuse two more powers. With this, I can fuse five powers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana once told him that some powerful geniuses could fuse four powers before breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness. At that time, Osborne found it hard to believe and felt a significant gap between himself and those geniuses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne can not only fuse four powers in advance but even fuse five powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "If I fuse five powers, my Sacred Power should be stronger than that of an ordinary primary Empyrean Sacredness warrior, and might even rival the Sacred Power of some mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was full of anticipation, thinking, "Let me start fusing the powers now. For the fourth power, I choose the fire elemental power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already made up his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's fire elemental essence wasn't strong. But after absorbing Agatha's nine drops of Phoenix Blood, he unexpectedly ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This caused his fire elemental essence to undergo a terrifying mutation, becoming incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If fused into the Sacred Power, it would make his Sacred Power stronger and imbued with the terrifying corrosive power of the Dark Phoenix Flame.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, Osborne's Sacred Power would be truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, when fusing the fourth power, Osborne chose the fire elemental power without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the help of the foundational carrier, the entire process went smoothly. Osborne easily transferred the fire elemental essence into the foundational carrier. Under the effect of the Fusion Vessel, the fire elemental power completely merged with his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne clearly felt his Sacred Power become much stronger, almost comparable to the Sacred Power of a primary Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this was not the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "For the fifth power, I'll choose physical strength. My body is already infinitely close to the advanced Sacredness Level. At this moment, my physical strength is incredibly powerful. If I don't integrate it into my Sacred Power, it would be such a waste."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took action again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Osborne transferred the essence of his physical strength into the foundational carrier. His physical strength smoothly merged with spatial power, dark power, Thunder Power, and fire power, making his Sacred Power even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt as if his body had swelled up. The intensity of his Sacred Power was terrifying, making him feel as if he were invincible, fearing no opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, this was just an illusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne was very certain that the intensity of his current Sacred Power was already terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he were to join the state duel now, even if Agatha, Horace, Broderick, Benson, and others joined forces, they would be easily defeated by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They simply couldn't withstand even a casual attack from his Sacred Power after merging the five forces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt extremely excited and muttered to himself, "I'm so powerful now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness, there shouldn't be many who can merge five forces in advance, right? In fact, if a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness can merge five forces, they are already considered very powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, the five forces I've merged are incredibly powerful. My spatial power, dark power, Thunder Power, and fire power elemental essences have all reached the highest Ascension Ten. Plus, they've undergone mutations, making them inherently strong. My physical strength far surpasses opponents of the same cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After merging these forces, the strength of my Sacred Power is terrifying. Even if others can merge five forces, their Sacred Power wouldn't be as powerful as mine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, my cultivation level has finally broken through to Ascension Ten, reaching Quasi Empyrean Sacredness. Now, I should be able to handle a warrior at primary Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"More importantly, over the years, my </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, Warfare Shield, Warfare Scythe, and Solar Battleship have been continuously nurtured by the Warfare Ancient Tree. Although their grade hasn't improved, their power is now stronger than before."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it comes to Sacred Artifacts, I won't lose. Even the Ascending Sacred Sanctum has been partially repaired by the Warfare Ancient Tree, making it stronger than before. Even I feel that I'm a bit excessively powerful now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed happily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The goals he set before starting his cultivation were almost all achieved. This gave Osborne a sudden feeling of losing direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't know how to improve further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He now seems to have reached the limit below Empyrean Sacredness. If he wants to continue improving, it's incredibly difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "With my current strength, I can easily win the Zone Duel. In fact, even if I were to compete in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, unless an exceptionally formidable opponent appeared, none of the other participants would stand a chance against me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But my goal has never been to win the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, but revenge."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's gaze suddenly turned icy. He thought of the bullying and humiliation he suffered in the palace of the Glorious Divine Kingdom in his previous life, and of his mother being framed and executed by those people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes filled with killing intent, Osborne thought, "My enemies are the entire Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, even the king of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, my father. Their strength is immense. I cannot be complacent now; I must continue to grow stronger."</span></p></div>
