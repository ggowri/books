        <h1>Chapter 1906 Return to Wild Flame City</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided it was time to end his seclusion and leave Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had spent nearly two and a half years in isolation, but thanks to a hundredfold acceleration, only nine days had passed in the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just those nine days, Osborne had transformed completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After consuming twelve hundred blue Miracle Elixirs, he had nearly exhausted the supply, but it was worth it. His dark, space, and lightning elemental essences had all undergone a metamorphosis, reaching Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference between Level Nine and the peak of Level Eight was astronomical&mdash;it was a whole new ballgame. The power he could now wield was vastly superior to what he had before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, his dark energy had evolved to match that of Lord Malevolence. Now, if someone were to be struck by his dark energy, even the white Miracle Elixir would struggle to heal them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, with Level Nine elemental essences, Osborne's control over power had sharpened significantly, and he had mastered three distinct Divine Ascendance Techniques&mdash;Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes, Spatial Oblivion Slash, and Multi-thunder Chainstorm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each technique provided a tremendous boost to his abilities, and now he possessed all three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Osborne of nine days ago were to face the current version of himself, he would have no choice but to flee&mdash;otherwise, he would be annihilated in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I wonder how things would go if I faced Trevor again? Even if I'm not quite his match yet, I should be able to hold my own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now that my space elemental essence has hit Level Nine, even Trevor's Universe-Sealing Formation won't be able to trap me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one will be able to confine me so easily anymore. If I need to escape, it'll be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But still, I need to get stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My supply of Miracle Elixirs is dwindling, and nearly half of the Blood Demon members haven't broken through to the Deity King level yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to gather more Miracle Elixirs to boost our power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First things first, I'll head to the East Zone to hunt for them. But before that, I need to stir up some trouble in the East Zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne activated his interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that his space elemental essence had reached Level Nine, the distance he could cover with interdimensional travel had increased tenfold, allowing him to traverse 60 million miles in a single jump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given that the distance from the South Zone to the East Zone was only 1.2 billion miles, he could make the trip in just twenty jumps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne now, it was a breeze&mdash;he didn't even need to stop midway to recharge his divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calculating two seconds for each jump, he arrived in the East Zone in under half a minute, appearing just outside Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already collected Divine Peak Nine near Wild Flame City, but his reason for coming back was to create some commotion in the East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just for kicks. He had the Hudson family to consider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a month since he had left them, and Trevor was already onto the connection between Osborne and the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would likely leak the news about the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings to the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Baxter family had long since betrayed the Human Community and pledged their allegiance to the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the Paramount Supreme Clan's arrogance and their deep-seated hatred for the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, it was only a matter of time before they made their move. If they believed that Osborne was hiding out with the Hudson family, then the Hudson family would inevitably be dragged into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To protect them, Osborne decided to create a stir, making it clear to the Paramount Supreme Clan that he was not in the Hudson family's territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they targeted the Hudson family, they wouldn't be able to eliminate the Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where should I strike?" he pondered, gazing at Wild Flame City in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to make a big enough splash to draw the Paramount Supreme Clan's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not issue a challenge again?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne acted immediately, appearing high above Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city was home to five floating mountains, one of which had once belonged to the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Mystic Feather Clan had long since fled, making their way toward the West Zone. Given their current speed, it would be a while before they arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, that floating mountain had become a stronghold for a new group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? The Demonic Dragon Clan? They've taken over the Mystic Feather Clan's floating mountain? I've been itching to deal with them for a while now. Time to wipe them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne raised his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a tempest of lightning erupted above the floating mountain, engulfing it in a cataclysmic display. The members of the Demonic Dragon Clan, caught completely off guard, were consumed by the terrifying storm before they even had a chance to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, there were hardly any Deity Kings&mdash;only a few at the early stages and maybe a couple in the mid-stages. How could they possibly withstand Osborne's onslaught?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, the entire Demonic Dragon Clan's presence on the floating mountain was reduced to nothing but charred ash, their screams silenced by the fury of the lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice then thundered across Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings have returned!"</span></p></div>
