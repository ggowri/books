        <h1>Chapter 1908 Operation Canceled</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of cloaked figures responded in unison, their eyes alight with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor donned his own black attire and mask, his demeanor cold and commanding. "After we carry out this mission, your identities might be exposed, but don't sweat it! If we succeed in taking down the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, it will all be worth it! The Paramount Supreme Clan won't just welcome you into their fold. They'll reward you handsomely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once they unify Celestara, you'll be hailed as heroes! Exposing your identities to eliminate the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings is a small price to pay!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's get moving!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paramount Supreme Clan is waiting for our good news&mdash;success is our only option!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Trevor commanded, "Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black-clad figures slipped away from the Baxter family's estate, heading towards the Hudson family's residence outside Apocalypse City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were traitors who had long since abandoned the Human Community, aligning themselves with the Paramount Supreme Clan. Hiding within the Human Community, they had been leaking crucial intelligence to their new masters, biding their time for the day when the Paramount Supreme Clan would dominate Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, in order to eliminate the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, the Paramount Supreme Clan demanded that they risk exposing their identities to breach the defenses of the Hudson family and annihilate the Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason? The extraordinary talent and potential displayed by these young prodigies had sent a shiver down the spine of the Paramount Supreme Clan, a threat they could no longer ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor watched the direction they departed with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore? You're done for! And the Hudson family? Tonight is your doom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These guys may only be at the peak of the Deity King level, but each of them bears a Divine Mark from the Divine Ascendance Technique. Those marks were painstakingly inscribed by the Supernal Deity Kings of the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With that many Divine Marks in play, the Hudson family is bound to fall!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings will meet the same fate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence radiated from Trevor's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a ripple appeared beside him, and the Binding Twin Pearl on him began to glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dark dimensional portal materialized, and Trevor's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The Binding Twin Pearl is glowing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is someone from the Paramount Supreme Clan using it to teleport here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do they not trust me? Do they need to see the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings killed with their own eyes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered, a shadow emerged from the portal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor quickly clasped his hands together in greeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Theobald Eldridge! What brings you here? Do you have further instructions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure known as Theobald Eldridge wasted no time. "Trevor, you need to halt tonight's operation immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's heart sank at those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Theobald Eldridge, the team is already en route to the Hudson family's residence! They're probably almost there, ready to strike! Why the sudden change? I've set everything up to ensure we can take down the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings tonight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theobald scoffed, his voice laced with disdain. "You think you can guarantee their downfall tonight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How? Your intel is flawed! The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings aren't even at the Hudson family's place! They showed up in Wild Flame City in the East Zone just half an hour ago, setting up a challenging arena to take on the young talents of the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the point of attacking the Hudson family now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're not worth the effort! We shouldn't waste our Divine Marks or risk exposing so many identities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cancel the operation immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Theobald's words, Trevor was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings... they showed up in Wild Flame City in the East Zone? Damn it! They must have just left the Hudson family's place! If only we had acted sooner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret washed over Trevor's face as he realized their plans had just crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no point in lamenting now. Since the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings were no longer at the Hudson family's residence, they had to cancel the operation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it wasn't worth exposing so many operatives and wasting precious Divine Marks just to take out the Hudson family if they couldn't eliminate the true targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching his teeth, Trevor quickly sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Operation canceled! Everyone, return immediately! Hand over all Divine Marks and continue to lie low. We need to gather intel for the Paramount Supreme Clan and wait for their next orders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he finalized the commands, dark clouds hung over Trevor's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those damn Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! How dare they provoke the Paramount Supreme Clan again? They're just a bunch of ants at the Deity King level! They shouldn't have left the safety of the Hudson family, daring to run off to the East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do they really think their spatial powers can protect them from harm? They're just asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Theobald. "Mr. Theobald Eldridge, what's the plan from here? Does the Paramount Supreme Clan have a solid strategy to wipe out the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theobald shot back, his tone icy. "Know your place, and don't overstep!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just keep your identity hidden and focus on gathering intelligence on the influential forces within the Human Community. Once the Paramount Supreme Clan unifies Celestara, they won't forget the Baxter family's contributions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the rest, that's for the Paramount Supreme Clan to handle. The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings? They'll face certain death if they dare show their faces again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They won't survive the wrath of the Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p></div>
