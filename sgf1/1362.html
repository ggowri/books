        <h1>Chapter 1361 The Appearance of Ophelia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, Divine Shadow, and the others felt a surge of anticipation at Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, be careful!" they warned him, quickly activating their keys to the Dimensional Microcosm and stepping inside for safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation in </span><span>Celestara</span><span> was uncertain, and entering it could bring unforeseen dangers. Their power levels were too low, so hiding within Osborne's Dimensional Microcosm seemed the safest option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everyone had entered and confirmed that the Dimensional Microcosm was still protected by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Celestara</span><span>, here I come!" he declared, his voice filled with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne unleashed the full force of his spatial abilities, breaking through the barrier of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low hum resonated as a dimensional portal opened, bridging Blue Planet and </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt a tremendous surge of chaotic energy pouring from </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. The portal pulled at him with an overwhelming force, and he let himself be drawn into it, surrendering to the current.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even Osborne felt a twinge of unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard countless legends about </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, but he still had no real grasp of what awaited him there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is </span><span>Celestara</span><span> like after the war of doom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there still a place for humanity there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has Lord Malevolence fully escaped and regained his strength? How powerful is the Dark Deity Legion in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are Isa and the others?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are my parents still alive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about Anastasia and Zoe's biological parents? Could one of them be from </span><span>Celestara</span><span>? Will I finally find them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne traversed the dimensional portal, his heart raced with a mix of excitement and anxiety. This journey was to an entirely foreign place, far beyond the simple act of traveling to another country; it felt like stepping into another world altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost like heading to another planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to stretch at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 140-thousand-mile-long dimensional portal felt endless, as if he could never reach the other side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne sensed something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of his passage through the portal should have been swift; even crossing two worlds, it shouldn't feel like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body felt as if it were suspended in time, completely unable to move, and he </span><span>wasn't getting any closer to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a realization struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something's wrong! Time is frozen here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly activated Satan's Eye, and while everything around him remained motionless, he found himself able to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to his own time power, Osborne could still act even in this frozen moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if drawn by an instinct, he turned sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock as he recognized a familiar figure standing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Ophelia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his astonishment, she was right there, coldly observing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she noticed Osborne moving within her Time Realm, her expression shifted to one of surprise, and she furrowed her brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can actually navigate through time in my Realm? Osborne, you're stronger than before," Ophelia murmured softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a moment to steady himself, frowning as he replied, "Ophelia, when did you arrive? Have you been following me? What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia gazed at Osborne's face, noticing the wariness in his eyes directed at her. She furrowed her brows, a flicker of anger igniting in the depths of her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne. you think I'd ever hurt you?" she said icily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wouldn't you?" Osborne shot back just as coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's frustration boiled over. "Osborne, if I wanted you dead, you'd already be gone! Your so-called strength might impress others, but to me, it's nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I could snuff you out without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Isa were to reappear, she couldn't stop me. You think I'd harm you? Why would you even think that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've apologized to you! I've admitted my mistake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why won't you forgive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's voice escalated into a frenzy, her face alternating between shades of red and white. Her erratic behavior struck Osborne as unsettling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her body trembling violently, her features contorted with an increasing savagery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lethal wave of murderous intent erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer intensity of it left Osborne frozen, as if plunged into an icy abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Ophelia's sanity was unraveling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clutching her head, she bellowed, "Why? Why won't you forgive me? I've admitted my fault, so why won't you forgive me?"</span></p></div>
