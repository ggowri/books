        <h1>Chapter 879 Targeting</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the beginning of the Honor Quest Ceremony to now, Osborne had only defeated two challengers, yet his performance had left everyone in awe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long ago, when he first stepped onto the stage, the crowd had booed and ridiculed him, convinced that he was the weakest participant ever to hold an Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had expected Osborne's event to descend into a spectacle of shame, and many members of the Augustine family shared those very sentiments.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, just minutes later and merely two challenges down, it felt as if everyone had been slapped in the face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's power had exceeded their expectations.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his effortless takedown of Clay and Satoru, it became clear that this Honor Quest Ceremony wouldn't result in disgrace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They now understood that Osborne could easily rack up a winning streak of twenty, thirty, or even more.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though this wasn't monumental, it certainly wouldn't be a source of humiliation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The members of the Augustine family were reveling in their newfound pride. Once, they had been unable to hold their heads high, facing ridicule from powerful forces around the world. They had felt like they'd rather disappear into the ground than endure the scorn.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, their spirits were buoyant, their excitement palpable. Osborne's strength had given them something to stand up for.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph! What's the big deal? Those two he beat didn't even make it to the Godson Rankings! All he's done is win two matches!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's still a long way to go. He needs at least eight more wins to ensure his Honor Quest Ceremony doesn't turn into a laughingstock!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, this negativity was fading, the jeers becoming whispers. No one else dared to mock Osborne, a mark of the respect he was commanding.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's keep this rolling!" Osborne called out, unfazed by the mixed reactions swirling around him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't help but wonder how they would react when he truly began to unleash his potential.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ceremony resumed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next challengers weren't from the League of Divine Descent, and while Osborne defeated them in a single blow, he was careful not to inflict injury.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Given his current strength level, taking down these average Class AAAs was child's play.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He recalled how he used to envy Isa, who effortlessly dispatched opponents with a mere kick, sending anyone, regardless of their power, flying.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, Osborne had reached that level himself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His Explosive Force had developed to proficiency, and with Point Blank Force, he only needed a fraction of his strength to breach defenses and secure victories.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each challenger that came forward found themselves unable to withstand his attacks, one by one getting kicked off the platform.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, if they were affiliated with the League of Divine Descent, Osborne showed no such restraint, delivering brutal strikes that left their ribs shattered, unceremoniously booting them aside like trash.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, no one thought much of it, but gradually, it became evident that Osborne was selectively targeting the League of Divine Descent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Its members began to seethe with anger, fixing furious glares on him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even atop the platform, Everett and Rumen couldn't hold back their disdain, their expressions gloomy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still, Jackie's presence kept them in check.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the victories mounted, Osborne racked up his ninth win.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one who had faced Osborne could withstand a single blow. Some were sent flying by a slap, while others were kicked off the stage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were no exceptions.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This spectacle only fueled the excitement among the Augustine family members; their faces flushed with exhilaration as they began to cheer for Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With one more victory, he would achieve ten consecutive wins!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Securing ten victories would mean Osborne had made significant progress in this Honor Quest Ceremony, at least enough to silence those who called it a disgrace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Humph! Marlon, Osborne is clearly targeting our League of Divine Descent!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony seethed, her teeth clenched.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she watched Osborne effortlessly dispatch challenger after challenger, her eyes burned with fury.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, ranked 398 on the Godson Rankings, she knew it wasn't her time to step in. If it were, she'd be eager to take the stage and deliver a crushing defeat to Osborne, humiliating him in front of everyone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon chuckled. "We pressured the Augustine family into handing over seventy percent of their rare metal profits. It's only natural for Osborne, as the Augustine family's primary heir, to harbor some resentment and want to take it out on us.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry; he won't be able to keep this up for long. Someone will take care of him!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Honor Quest Ceremony rolled on.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne faced his tenth challenger, the crowd erupted in gasps when they saw who it was.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, too, was taken aback.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was yet another familiar face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Emi!</p></div>
