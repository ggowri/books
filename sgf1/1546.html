        <h1>Chapter 1545 The Furious Bowman Family</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an explosion! How did this little vial survive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself as he picked it up, curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment, then twisted the cap open. A unique fragrance wafted out, catching him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this... Soul Resonance Fluid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brow furrowed in disappointment. Soul Resonance Fluid was far too common in his line of work. As a member of the Wild Flame Army, he often ventured into the wild to hunt </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, and this fluid was known for its ability to attract those creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't worth much at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to toss the bottle aside, he paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute. This Soul Resonance Fluid belonged to Tobey! How could someone from the Paramount Supreme Clan have such a thing? Could it be... Ultimate Soul Resonance Fluid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of excitement ignited within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Lachlan's memories, Ultimate Soul Resonance Fluid was a prized possession, worth millions of Essence Crystals per drop, and it was nearly impossible to buy even if one had the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fluid's primary function was to attract high-level </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were ever chased by powerful creatures, tossing out some of this fluid could draw their attention away, allowing him to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This could be a lifesaver! One drop is worth a million Essence Crystals, and this bottle has at least a dozen drops! I've hit the jackpot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a triumphant grin, Osborne stored the Soul Resonance Fluid in his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a final sweep of the area, he meticulously erased all traces of the battle, even ensuring that the remains of Myron, Sara, and Tobey were completely destroyed. He knew he had to leave swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a shame I didn't get a chance to scavenge the Essence Crystals in Zone 1! But after taking out Myron, Sara, and Tobey, I can't stick around here. If anyone finds out I was behind their deaths, I'll be in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget about the Paramount Supreme Clan. The Royston family in Wild Flame City alone is a force I can't handle right now! They are the top family in the city. I need to get out of here and come back later for the Essence Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne stepped into the parallel space, vanishing from the abandoned mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>High above the landscape, a colossal mountain loomed, crowned by an ancient palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethereal wisps of blue smoke curled into the air, giving the place an otherworldly feel and a sacred aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the palace of the Bowman family, one of the families in the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the ancestral hall, a blood-red token suddenly cracked at the moment of Tobey's death, disintegrating into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faint sound of shattering brought an elderly man, meditating with his eyes closed, back to reality. He opened his eyes, which now glinted with icy fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My grandson! Tobey!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine Bowman stared at the broken </span><span>token,</span><span> his heart heavy with grief. Rage surged through him, filling the entire Bowman family with a palpable tension. Snow began to fall, blanketing the massive mountain in a thick layer of white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, several powerful figures rushed into the ancestral hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A serious-looking middle-aged man, who bore a striking resemblance to Tobey, looked intently at the elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's voice was cold and filled with dread. "Aldrich, Tobey's soul token has shattered! He's dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich Bowman's eyes widened in disbelief as he turned to the remnants of Tobey's soul token. Rage boiled within him, his eyes turning a fierce red as he processed the devastating news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tobey! My son! Who did this? Who dared to kill him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He had the protective soul energy from the esteemed Lord Malevolence himself&mdash;how could he possibly be dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who has the audacity to take his life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine shook his head, his expression grave. "Tobey went alone to the East Zone, likely in Wild Flame City right now. Whoever killed him must be from there! It could even be that mysterious girl...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only the soul energy from the esteemed Lord Malevolence could reveal who did this! Unfortunately, he's in seclusion recovering and can't be reached."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint flickered in Maxine's eyes. "No matter who took Tobey's life, we will have our revenge. We are the Paramount Supreme Clan, the Bowman family! No one gets away with killing one of our own, especially not my grandson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Aldrich with a steely gaze. "Aldrich, you need to head to Wild Flame City immediately! Whoever killed Tobey must pay with their life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't afford to make mistakes&mdash;kill them all if you have to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich clenched his jaw, determination etched on his face. "You can count on me, Dad. Tobey was my son, and I will avenge him! No matter who it is, even if there's just a hint of suspicion, I won't let them escape! Every potential killer must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a terrifying power erupted from him, sending a shiver down the spines of those present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the might of a Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had finally returned to the Gellar family's Zone 8, preparing to head back to Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to leave, he unexpectedly spotted a familiar face.</span></p></div>
