        <h1>Chapter 19 I’ll make him live in hell.</h1>
        <div><p>Justin’s mind was a storm of anger as he gritted his teeth and stared at Osborne. Without uttering any harsh words, he quickly lowered his head and left.</p><p>“Those who talk don’t act, and those who act don’t talk,” Osborne murmured. As he sensed Justin’s murderous intent, his expression hardened.</p><p>He had truly angered Justin this time. But Osborne didn’t care, as he was no longer the same person he used to be. If Justin still saw Osborne as the former useless man, Justin would be in for a very harsh reality.</p><p>Osborne didn’t bother with Ophelia and the others anymore and walked in through the VIP lane, accompanied by the enthusiastic Debbe.</p><p>Ophelia looked grim, but she didn’t dare to stop them.</p><p>Meanwhile, the others around them speculated about Osborne’s background, thinking about how they could approach and connect with him later.</p><p>Regardless of his background, as long as his identity as a VIP of the Draco Group was authentic, it was enough for these elite families to humble themselves to associate with him.</p><p>“Damn bastard,” Ophelia muttered through gritted teeth. “A fake is still a fake. Even if Osborne can fool everyone for a while, he won’t be able to fool them forever. When his true identity is exposed, he will be the one to suffer. He’s just a worthless piece of trash.”</p><p>Ophelia was feeling extremely annoyed at that moment.</p><p>The ex-husband she despised had somehow become a VIP at Draco Auction House and could use the exclusive VIP lane while she had to wait in line.</p><p>Even though Ophelia knew he was a fake VIP, that still didn’t make her feel any better.</p><p>Proud as she was, she couldn’t stand the idea that her useless ex was more celebrated than her.</p><p>Just then, an arrogant voice suddenly rang out. “Oh, Ophelia, you’re here already?”</p><p>Ophelia turned to look and immediately smiled. “Wesley, you made it.”</p><p>Wesley, the heir of the prestigious Ashford family, was a top young gentleman in Mayby City. The Ashford family was more powerful than the Caldwell family and ranked among the top five elite families in Mayby City.</p><p>The reason Ophelia divorced Osborne was to marry Wesley. Although she had no feelings for Wesley, she didn’t mind this business alliance, as marrying Wesley would fortify the Caldwell family.</p><p>Wesley didn’t care that she had been married before because marrying her would also strengthen the Ashford family.</p><p>He smiled faintly and said, “Why do you guys look upset, Ophelia? Did something happen? Tell me. You are my fiancée now. If something is wrong, you can come directly to me. I have some influence.”</p><p>After Wesley finished speaking proudly, Ophelia’s expression shifted immediately.</p><p>She asked, “Do you know someone at Draco Auction House?”</p><p>With a proud look, Wesley nodded. “Yes, I have a friend who’s an executive there.”</p><p>Ophelia laughed upon hearing that and began to recount what had just happened, saying, “Wesley, it’s my useless ex-husband. He is pretending to be a VIP…”</p><p>Wesley’s face darkened at that.</p><p>He didn’t mind that Ophelia had been married before, but that didn’t mean he could tolerate Osborne’s existence. To Wesley, Ophelia’s ex-husband was better off dead.</p><p>Wesley snorted, “A worthless commoner pretending to be a VIP of the Draco Group? No matter what trickery he’s used, I’ll expose him. Just wait. I’ll get my friend to check immediately. Once I expose his true identity, I’ll make him live in hell.”</p><p>With that, Wesley’s whole demeanor was radiating with murderous intent.</p><p>Meanwhile, Osborne, led by Debbe, was walking through the VIP lane. Though she was a middle-aged woman, her curvy hips swayed, and her waist moved enticingly, making her very alluring.</p><p>“Are you satisfied with how I’ve handled things, Mr. Augustine?” she asked with a smile.</p><p>Osborne nodded and gratefully replied, “Thank you for helping me, Ms. Lewis. I’m very satisfied. However, it seems a bit too high-profile. Now, many people in Mayby City might be speculating about my true identity.”</p><p>Debbe smiled faintly, “Mr. Augustine, you are the owner of the Draco Star Wristlet and a close confidant of the Godfather. No matter how hard they dig, they won’t uncover anything.</p><p>“If anyone dares to cause trouble, I will reveal your identity, Mr. Augustine. I believe no one in Mayby City will dare to mess with you then.”</p><p>Osborne shook his head and said, “I prefer not to reveal my identity. I’d appreciate it if you could say that my VIP status is just a part of your promotion. I want people to think I’m just an ordinary person.”</p><p>Debbe was stunned by Osborne’s words.</p><p>Everyone in this world wanted to become a big shot, hoping to be flattered and pleased by others. It was like those typical salespeople who would always title themselves as sales managers on their business cards.</p><p>Employees hoped others thought they were managers, managers hoped others thought they were the boss, and bosses hoped others thought their companies were among the elite. Everyone exaggerated their status as much as possible to appear more prestigious.</p><p>But Osborne wanted to keep his identity a secret.</p><p>“May I ask why, Mr. Augustine? If your identity were made public, it would be much easier for you to operate in Mayby City. All the influential families would have to curry favor with you,” Debbe asked in confusion.</p></div>
