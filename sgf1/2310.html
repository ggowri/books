        <h1>Chapter 2259 Shocked Angela-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "Sure, I've got some self-confidence! If I didn't believe in myself, why would I even bother signing up for the city duel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela could tell that Osborne was beating around the bush and not giving her a straightforward answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> she dug deeper. "Just be honest with me. How confident are you that you'll win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh and was at a loss for words for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, </span><span>he</span><span> </span><span>spoke up, trying to be as objective as he could, "I'd say my chances are about fifty-fifty. After all, I haven't gone up against Leroy yet, so I've got no clue about her full strength and abilities. All I know for sure is that she's already mastered Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, when it comes to taking her on, I can only be fifty percent confident at the moment. The same goes for Clara from Fantasia Isle. I haven't seen her in action either, and she could very well stand in my way of winning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's eyes popped in shock as she took in his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It suddenly hit her that, in Osborne's book, the only real roadblocks to his victory were Leroy and Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he hadn't crossed paths with them yet, he was feeling unsure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Marreese and Tyson? It seemed he didn't see them as serious competition, having already sized up their capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela stared intently at </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> her face </span><span>dead serious</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, she finally said, "Alright! I get it now! I just hope you're not all talk. Let me be the first to wish you luck in making it to the top three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile and didn't say anything else as he turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela hesitated for a second and then called out, "Come here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Olsen? What's the matter?" a disciple asked, looking confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's ten thousand in Sacred Crystals. Take this to the casino and place a bet on Osborne winning the championship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disciple's eyes bulged in disbelief. "Ms. Olsen..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela waved her hand nonchalantly. "Don't even try to talk me out of it! Osborne is my disciple from Peak Seven. If he's bold enough to bet ten thousand Sacred Crystals on himself, why shouldn't I have faith in him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, it's just ten thousand Sacred Crystals. If I lose, I'll just roll up my sleeves and earn them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if I win... well, that's a mind-boggling 1.3 million Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That'd be more than enough to deal a heavy financial blow to Azure Haven Academy! And it'd keep me well-supplied with resources for ages."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grin spread across Angela's face as she let her imagination run wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her excitement was practically oozing out. "Of course, all this hinges on Osborne actually pulling off a win! If he does, I'll get in touch with Ms. Alba right away and make sure we get Osborne over to Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Angela's eyes were alight with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was completely oblivious to the fact that Angela had also placed a ten-thousand-Sacred-Crystal bet on him. If he'd known, he would've surely given her a </span><span>thumbs</span><span>-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Osborne, he was still deep in thought, musing about how to create more foundational carriers for his Fusion Vessel to tap into greater power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time zipped by, and before long, the day of the city duel rolled around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city duel in Tempest Fortress City was about to get underway, with the draw of lots in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All in all, Tempest Fortress City was home to three Second-rate Powers&mdash;Azure Haven Academy, Fantasia Isle, and Mystic Sirius Sect. Each of these powers had sent ten disciples to take part in the city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, hundreds of Third-rate Powers had picked their thirty-four best disciples, bringing the total number of participants in the duel to sixty-four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city duel was scheduled to last six days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, the sixty-four contestants would draw lots to be divided into sixteen groups of four, where they'd go head-to-head. The top performers from each group would move on to the top sixteen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, the top sixteen would face each other, eventually deciding the champions and the top three contenders who'd represent Tempest Fortress City in the state duel.</span><span> </span></p></div>
