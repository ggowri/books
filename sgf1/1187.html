        <h1>Chapter 1186 Time Power</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What new abilities would Level Eight Satan's Eye unlock? Osborne had no clue, nor did anyone else in the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had ever ascended their Satan's Eye to Level Eight, or even Level Seven for that matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The capabilities of Level Seven&mdash;Temporal Stasis&mdash;had been theorized by the family's ancestors after extensive research.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Level Eight, even speculation was beyond reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's curiosity was piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Level Seven ability is Temporal Stasis, which freezes time within a 33-foot </span><span>radius for a single second. While it's not very practical in battle, considering its limited range and duration, enhanced Temporal Stasis could be a game-changer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ophelia pulled that stunt at Gerardo's lair, she used Temporal Stasis, and I was totally helpless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My time was frozen; my brain couldn't think, and my body couldn't move while she attacked at her leisure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That power is terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she's the God of Time, so her mastery of time power is way beyond anything Satan's Eye could ever hope to achieve. If I could get even a tenth of that ability, it would dramatically boost my power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne pondered, he couldn't help but feel a surge of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye, absorbing the core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, underwent a dramatic transformation. Just as he had hoped, without any surprises, it broke through to Level Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, eight luminous stars appeared in his left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, they had been a pale purple, but now they glowed with the same crimson hue as the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Level Eight mutant Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flood of information surged into Osborne's mind, revealing the new ability that accompanied the breakthrough&mdash;Temporal Dominator!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer just Temporal Stasis, but the ability to manipulate time&mdash;accelerate, decelerate, or freeze it&mdash;except for reversing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revelation left Osborne stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maneuvering time? Isn't that Ophelia's&mdash;the God of Time's&mdash;power? My Satan's Eye at Level Eight grants me control over time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Manipulating time was among the rarest and most potent powers in existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even spatial powers paled in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To wield such power through his Satan's Eye marked a monumental shift in his abilities and combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed the effects his Level Eight Satan's Eye could exert on time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, there's a time freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, I could only halt time in a 30-feet radius for a mere second. Now, within a thousand yards, I can freeze time in any chosen area for an entire minute!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any adversary caught within this radius is trapped in a time-frozen state for a full minute, unable to think or act until I release them. By the time they break free, it's too late for them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of manipulating time was simply awe-inspiring. He could recall his battles with Ophelia, where he couldn't fight back, trapped under her relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it not been for his robust defenses or Ophelia's reluctance to kill him, he wouldn't have survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, thanks to his Level Eight Satan's Eye, Osborne could do the very same things!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides freezing time, I can also slow down or speed up time in any area within a thousand yards!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If an enemy is moving too fast, I can slow down time around them, making their relative speed crawl to a snail's pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can slow time by ten times, and it'll last an entire hour!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same goes for speeding up time&mdash;I can accelerate it by tenfold for an entire hour!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I use it on myself, while others experience just one hour, I'll have lived through ten hours!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Imagine how much faster I can train and grow stronger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ecstatic. The Level Eight Satan's Eye had granted him mastery over time, and if used wisely, it would undoubtedly skyrocket his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What mattered most was that he now wielded time power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next time he faced Ophelia, he wouldn't be reduced to a defenseless punching bag, unable to strike back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect! With Satan's Eye breaking through to Level Eight, all of its abilities have been massively enhanced, including Memory Control! I should now be able to extract Cain's memories..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile grew wider as he contemplated the possibilities.</span></p></div>
