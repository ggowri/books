        <h1>Chapter 2288 The Four Pinnacle Powerhouses-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the crowd let out another gasp. "Hey, look! Broderick's here too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burly, hirsute man ambled over. His hair was a blazing red, as if his entire body was engulfed in flames. He was like a walking fireball, and just a single glance at him made one's eyes smart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly activated Satan's Eye and peered over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but mutter in awe, "Damn, what raw power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He must have merged his fire power with his physical and divine power. Whether it's the fire power, his physical might, or his divine power, they're all bound to be aggressive and explosive. So after the fusion, his Sacred Power is off-the-charts domineering!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">His attack power should be stronger than Benson's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Benson also opened his eyes and fixed his gaze on Broderick. Instantly, a fierce fighting spirit blazed in his eyes as he locked eyes with Broderick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick flashed a grin and cracked his knuckles menacingly at Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Benson let out a disdainful snort, and his fighting spirit started to ebb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shut his eyes again, but he'd already turned extra cautious, sizing Broderick up as a formidable foe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick hailed from the First-rate Power Fiery Volcanic Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, he boasted the royal bloodline of the Ebony Sheep Clan, wielding the clan's super abilities, and had mastered more than two Sacred Artifacts to perfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One tough cookie!" Osborne murmured to himself, unable to stifle a twinge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, another shout pierced the air. "Look! Horace is coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone whipped their heads around, Osborne, Benson, and Broderick included. The moment their eyes landed on Horace, they instinctively squinted, their faces turning grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace, the second-ranked powerhouse on the state duel strength leaderboard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was from the First-rate Power Chilling Nether Palace and was renowned for his Sacred Artifact&mdash;the Frost-invoking Canvas. It was said that during a city duel, with a wave of the Frost-invoking Canvas, he'd instantly encased everything within thousands of miles in ice. Even the Empyrean Sacredness warriors watching from the high platform had a hard time holding their ground against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he breezed through and snagged the championship with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the guy who was rumored to be capable of taking a shot at Empyrean Sacredness powerhouses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right then, Horace looked as ordinary as Joe Bloggs, giving away nothing of his true might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was precisely what made people sit up and take notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The less obvious his power, the more cautious they got. It was a tell-tale sign that he'd mastered his power to an insane degree, way beyond what Broderick and Benson could pull off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though all three of them had fused three types of power, Broderick and Benson clearly hadn't got a full grip on that potent Sacred Power. Their power was like a leaky faucet, always seeping out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Horace? He'd sorted that issue out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hell of a powerhouse!" Osborne could only catch a glimpse through Satan's Eye that Horace had fused ice elemental power, divine power, and soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's fused soul power. His tricks must be something else because of that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the place erupted in a frenzy. "Look out! Agatha's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone whipped their heads around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Agatha, the number one on the state duel strength leaderboard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like Benson, she hailed from the First-rate Power Resurgent Throne Palace. But in the grand scheme of things within the Resurgent Throne Palace, Agatha outranked Benson by a long shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was one of the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me among the top disciples in the Resurgent Throne Palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha boasted the ancient and scarce Lightning Phoenix bloodline. On top of that, she'd fused three types of power&mdash;thunder power, divine power, and soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Sacred Power was off the charts, and her control over it was on par with Horace's. What was more, she'd mastered the Ember Phoenix Clan's super-powerful Sacred Artifact, the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it that when she played the Phoenix Cry Melody, it was like casting a spell. Anyone within earshot would be in a daze, and even Empyrean Sacredness powerhouses would have a tough nut to crack resisting its allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Zephyr State officials thought the world of her. They reckoned that even without any heavy-hitting allies, she'd shine like a star in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Agatha needed was a bit of that sweet, sweet luck, and she'd be the one taking home the state duel championship!</span></p></div>
