        <h1>Chapter 2451 A Different Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I heard news that the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the Augustine family, will also participate in this year's Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel! Moreover, both the main bloodline and branch bloodline geniuses of the Augustine family will join!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even princes and princesses will participate!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald's words left all the judges stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Will members of the Royal Family also send participants to the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even princes and princesses will participate? Mr. Norton, are you referring to the sons and daughters of the Glorious Divine Emperor?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the Glorious Divine Kingdom, who else but the children of the Glorious Divine Emperor would dare to be called princes and princesses? Of course, it's them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For tens of thousands of years, the Glorious Divine Emperor has had over a hundred princes and princesses, most of whom have become Empyrean Sacredness warriors! Among them, the strongest Crown Prince, Second Prince, and Grand Princess have even surpassed Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. Their strength rivals that of the Glorious Divine Emperor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But there are still over a dozen princes and princesses who haven't broken through to Empyrean Sacredness! And in today's Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, at least several princes and princesses will participate!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Their strength is nothing Brenda can compare to!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald looked serious. "Do you think Brenda is strong? As a prodigy of a First-rate Power, she is indeed strong and never lacks resources! But compared to the princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, she is nothing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even at the same cultivation level, any prince or princess of the Glorious Divine Kingdom could easily defeat Brenda, even if she has a Legendary Sacred Artifact&mdash;it wouldn't matter!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because what Brenda has, they have too, and even more! But what they have, she may not have!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This will be an unfair fight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The top three of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel will undoubtedly be taken by the princes and princesses! As for what rank others can achieve, it depends on how many princes and princesses participate!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If five princes and princesses participate, then others can only compete for sixth place! If ten princes and princesses participate, then others can only compete for eleventh place!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am absolutely certain about this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Gerald finished speaking, the other judges were completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are the princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom really that powerful? I can hardly imagine it. We're all Ascension Ten Supernal Deity Kings, none of us have reached Empyrean Sacredness yet. Could there really be such a big gap in our strength?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald sneered, "Don't worry. The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel will definitely be broadcasted live in every major city! By then, you'll see for yourself just how powerful the princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom really are!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't understand simply because you've never seen them in action!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A judge curiously asked, "Mr. Norton, how do you know so much? Have you seen the princes and princesses in action?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He replied solemnly, "I have indeed seen them! Moreover, I witnessed two princes and three princesses in action. They are all Ascension Ten Supernal Deity Kings! At that time, they were sparring with someone, and their opponent was a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King sparring with a mid Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The judges exclaimed, "What was the final result? How long could they hold on?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald heard this and said, "Take a guess."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A judge pondered, "An ordinary Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King would definitely be defeated instantly by a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior. The gap is too vast. There's simply no comparison! If it's a prodigy like Brenda, she might be able to defeat an ordinary primary Empyrean Sacredness warrior and, with a powerful Sacred Artifact, withstand a few moves from a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But in the end, she would still be defeated by a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior within a minute!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So I guess the princes and princesses lasted around three minutes, maybe even longer..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That judge looked confident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald sneered, "You guessed the time right, but you got the outcome wrong!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Two princes and one princess defeated the mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior in about three minutes!"</span></p></div>
