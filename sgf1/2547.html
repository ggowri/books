        <h1>Chapter 2448 Leaving Here</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked excitedly at the massive corpse of the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every part of it is a treasure!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, the Magma Devourer was dead. Osborne's Satan's Eye enveloped it with ocular energy and instantly stored it in the Satan Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He planned to deal with its corpse later when he had time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most precious part of the Magma Devourer is its Marrow Crystal, but since the Marrow Crystal is deep within its body, extracting it won&rsquo;t be easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle here was too intense, sure to alarm others. For instance, Gerald might come to check out the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne knew it wasn&rsquo;t the right time to deal with the Magma Devourer&rsquo;s corpse; he had to leave quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately called Flash and Primordial to help clean up the battle traces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you really did it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial landed on Osborne's shoulder, looking at him with a mix of relief and envy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How about it? I didn&rsquo;t lie to you, right? After fusing Necrosnake&rsquo;s fangs, the Warfare Scythe is definitely one of the sharpest blades in the world!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Without it, with your strength, it&rsquo;d be impressive if you could even leave a scratch on the Magma Devourer! As for this 500 yards deep wound, even if your strength were a hundred times greater, you still couldn&rsquo;t do it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, even with the Warfare Scythe, if I hadn&rsquo;t calculated the Magma Devourer&rsquo;s weakness, you wouldn&rsquo;t have killed it! So, I&rsquo;m the biggest hero!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Primordial looked a bit smug, yearning for praise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew very well that killing the Magma Devourer wasn&rsquo;t due to his strength but the sharp Warfare Scythe and Primordial&rsquo;s calculations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both were essential!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On this basis, even if someone else delivered the strike, the result wouldn&rsquo;t differ much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne said, "You're right. The credit is yours. You're the biggest hero!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But for now, let's quickly clean up the battle traces here! I guess someone will arrive soon. We can't let anyone know we killed the Magma Devourer!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded but didn&rsquo;t take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since I'm the biggest hero, how could I do such a trivial task?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately rolled his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He ignored Primordial and started cleaning up with Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy in the distance finally snapped out of their shock. They exchanged a glance, still feeling each other's astonishment and disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne really killed the Magma Devourer with one strike!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That stunning and terrifying attack kept replaying in their minds, leaving them breathless with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That strike was incredible!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before it was swung, Clara and Leroy </span><span>believed that </span><span>Osborne must have lost his mind</span><span>.</span><span> Even Mr. Norton, who reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, couldn't kill the Magma Devourer. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What&rsquo;s the point of Osborne even trying?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This strike is bound to fail!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, with one strike, the result was unexpected. The terrifying Magma Devourer was killed instantly!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That scene left Clara and Leroy stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They watched as the massive Magma Devourer fell, Osborne standing mid-air with the Warfare Scythe in hand, looking down at its corpse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They both admitted that at that moment, their hearts were racing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne truly is a godlike, mysterious man!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Clara and Leroy couldn't figure out just how strong he really was. Every time they thought they understood him, he would unleash even more terrifying power the next time, shocking them all over again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, they had almost become numb to his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, they were shocked once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, that was the Magma Devourer!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy finally managed to suppress their shock and approached Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wanted to say something but ultimately stayed silent. They just quietly helped him, quickly cleaning up the traces of the battle around them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye scanned the surroundings. Once he confirmed there were no traces that could reveal their identities, he nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unless they use Time Retrace, no one could possibly know what happened here, let alone that I killed the Magma Devourer!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he waved at Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! We need to leave here quickly! Keep what happened here a secret."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne enveloped Clara and Leroy with his power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the battle with Magma Devourer, Flash was injured, especially his wings, so Osborne sent him into Drum's Dimensional Microcosm to recover.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial had also returned to his Soul Current Ocean at this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne used interdimensional travel, and they disappeared instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Gerald and the others finally passed through the thick volcanic ash and appeared here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the chaotic surroundings, sensing Magma Devourer's disappearance and the faint death scent, Gerald was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Magma Devourer was killed? How is that possible? Who killed it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Investigate! Look into it thoroughly for me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald and the others had just gotten halfway when they suddenly felt the battle stop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought Magma Devourer had killed its opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, they quickly sensed its presence vanish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald and the others hurried over, and only then did they confirm that Magma Devourer was killed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was tense all over at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he knew better than anyone how powerful Magma Devourer was, and any being capable of killing it so quickly was definitely not someone he could provoke!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it was incredibly quiet around. It seemed even the battle traces had been erased, and no powerful presence was hiding nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Gerald even more puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He ordered, "Investigate! We must find out who killed Magma Devourer! It killed so many of our people, so we can't let it disappear without a trace! Besides, every part of its body is a treasure, extremely valuable. We must locate it and the being that killed it..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, his efforts were destined to be in vain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had already left the volcanic area and arrived near the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He found a safe place and told Clara and Leroy that he needed to rest for a while.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, he entered Drum's Dimensional Microcosm alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Flash was lying in a flower bush. He was covered in blood, looking extremely battered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Flash with some concern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He managed to kill the Magma Devourer, and Flash deserved much of the credit. If Flash hadn&rsquo;t kept it occupied, it would have returned to its lair long ago. If Flash hadn&rsquo;t drawn its attention, Osborne wouldn&rsquo;t have succeeded so easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne placed his hand on Flash and used the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to heal his injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Flash recovered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then did Osborne breathe a sigh of relief and wave his hand to release the massive corpse of the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"While there's still some time, I need to quickly extract the Marrow Crystal!"</span></p></div>
