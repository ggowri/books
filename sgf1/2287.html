        <h1>Chapter 2245 Advancing to the Top Twenty-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, the opponents in Group Five were hardly formidable. In fact, their skills didn't even measure up to Lord Malevolence from </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking them down was easier than defeating Lord Malevolence himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, that was largely due to Lord Malevolence's impressive background as a former power broker from Racial Convergence Planet. Even though he was just the ruler of a Piddling Power, his prowess marked him as a true genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His overall score in the Astral Testing Arch was at least Class S, which just went to show how outrageously talented he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In comparison, none of Osborne's current rivals even came close to him when it came to natural ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was feeling pretty cocky. He knew he'd leveled up big-time since they'd last crossed paths. And this was a tournament. Everyone could use Apex divine artifacts to attack, but not to defend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could use those artifacts to protect themselves, it'd be like fighting a horde of armored turtles. There'd be no way to tell who'd win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the protection of those Apex divine artifacts, Osborne saw his opponents as sitting ducks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks would land like clockwork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he quickly took out two more fighters, the arena went dead silent. The ten remaining opponents stopped their scuffles and just stared at Osborne, their jaws on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did he seriously just drop two guys with a single arrow?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How on earth is that even doable? His attacks are off the charts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All their eyes zeroed in on the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A quasi-Sacred Artifact?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions did a total 180. Even as core disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect, not a single one of them had a quasi-Sacred Artifact. Those were only for the big shots like Vadim, Jamar, and Bethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten fighters shot Osborne dirty looks, finally realizing he was their number-one headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't have cared less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not looking to waste any more time. Why don't you all just come at me at once? It's just a group match, after all. The quicker I take you out, the quicker I can get back to my training," he said nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words really got their blood boiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arrogant prick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come at you together? You must be losing it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he just itching to get himself killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just let out a snort. "If you're too scared to go all-out as a group, then I'll make the first move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he pulled back the string of his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, ten arrows of divine power took shape, each one zeroing in on one of the ten fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic swept over them as they grasped what was about to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he for real? Does he actually think he can take all of us on at once? Who does he think he is&mdash;Vadim, Jamar, or Bethan? Even they wouldn't be crazy enough to claim they could take on ten opponents single-handedly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're digging your own grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage blazed in their eyes. They glanced at each other, well aware of the devastating might of Osborne's </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fate of the three vanquished by Osborne earlier was a stark warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't just play it safe; they had to take the initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's all go for him! He started it, so this </span><span>ain't</span><span> a dirty move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's teach this cocky jerk a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, they unleashed their combined force and charged at Osborne like an enraged tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, a glint of amusement in his eyes.</span></p></div>
