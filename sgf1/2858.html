        <h1>Chapter 2703 Alfreda Merges with the Elven Mother Tree</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda dragged Isidore near the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone in Elf City watched this scene in horror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some tried to escape, attempting to deactivate Elf City's defense shield and leave, but Clarissa took out another Legendary Sacred Artifact. After activating it, a new defense shield enveloped the entire Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, no one could leave anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyone who dares to run will die!" Clarissa said coldly, staring at a few Elf Race warriors attempting to attack her defense shield. She flicked her fingers lightly, and a powerful force sent them flying, leaving them severely injured and bleeding profusely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, everyone became even more terrified, and no one dared to escape anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clarissa's power was terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she was merely an advanced Empyrean Sacredness, her power surpassed that of an ordinary Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. Isidore, also an advanced Empyrean Sacredness, was no match for her and couldn't withstand even a single move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gap between them was too vast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda looked at the Elven Mother Tree, her eyes instantly turning red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda? You're really alive?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, three faces appeared on the massive Elven Mother Tree&mdash;Alfreda's parents and brother. Their voices trembled with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad! Mom! Brother!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda saw them, and tears burst from her eyes in excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's parents and brother also had red eyes. Especially after seeing Isidore defeated by Alfreda, they were completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda, what&rsquo;s going on?" Alfreda's father, Uriah, asked in shock. Alfreda's cultivation level was only at Ascension Four Supernal Deity King Level, a huge gap compared to Isidore's strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them could barely resist Isidore with the power of the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Isidore was actually subdued by Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "What did we miss?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only Uriah, but Hilaria and Sherwood also looked at Alfreda in shock and confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda quickly explained what had happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three immediately looked at Clarissa and Isa behind Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two politely bowed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We are Alfreda's good friends! Osborne asked us to accompany Alfreda back! He wanted to come rescue you himself, but he has very important matters to handle, so he sent us to help!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne..." Uriah murmured softly, his eyes full of gratitude.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, they were imprisoned and tortured by Isidore, and it was Osborne who saved them. Now, Osborne had saved them once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda, are you already with Osborne?" Hilaria suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a Nature Elf, her perception was already incredibly sharp, especially after merging with the Elven Mother Tree, it became even keener.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could clearly sense that Alfreda was no longer a girl but a woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's cheeks instantly turned as red as an apple upon hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She nodded and shyly said, "Mom, I'm already with Osborne! But now's not the time to talk about this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, Mom, Brother, what do you think we should do with Isidore?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them immediately had killing intent in their eyes upon hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just kill him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah gritted his teeth and said, "Although I really want to torture him and take revenge! But thinking about it, forget it. Our family is still alive, and that's enough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just kill him in front of the Elven Mother Tree!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for the others, they were just threatened and deceived by Isidore. Killing them would ruin Elf City, so just punish them instead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda hesitated a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She originally planned to kill them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She nodded and said, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Alfreda took out a dagger and coldly stared at Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore begged in terror, "No! Don't kill me! Princess Alfreda, don't kill me! I can serve you, I&rsquo;m still useful to you! Please, don't..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda ignored his pleas and unhesitatingly plunged the dagger into Isidore's heart, destroying his organs and killing him completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore slowly fell, his eyes filled with regret, but it was already too late for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda killed Isidore, feeling much relieved. She said, "Dad, Mom, Brother, I&rsquo;ll rescue you now! You&rsquo;re not meant to merge with the Elven Mother Tree, I&rsquo;ll take your place!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Alfreda took action immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Elven Mother Tree, merge with me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire Elf City, only Alfreda's physique was suitable for merging with the Elven Mother Tree. Only she could achieve a true fusion with the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Others could only forcefully merge, temporarily gaining part of the Elven Mother Tree's power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, Alfreda didn&rsquo;t choose to merge with the Elven Mother Tree for two reasons: first, her strength wasn&rsquo;t sufficient, posing a risk; second, once she merged with the Elven Mother Tree, it would disappear, and Elf City would lose its greatest support, no longer under the protection of the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the Elven Mother Tree, Elf City has its trump card.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without the Elven Mother Tree, Elf City is just an ordinary second-rate power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, the former Alfreda didn&rsquo;t merge with the Elven Mother Tree, but now, she must.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her parents and brother were forced to merge with the Elven Mother Tree, and due to incompatible physiques, they endure immense pain every day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To save them, Alfreda must merge with the Elven Mother Tree and replace them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the true merging began.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's parents and brother forcibly merged with the Elven Mother Tree, integrating into it and borrowing part of its power, but Alfreda's fusion with the Elven Mother Tree is entirely the opposite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Elven Mother Tree gradually became ethereal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah and the others were expelled by the power of the Elven Mother Tree, which rapidly shrank and finally merged into Alfreda's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's body was trembling, as if she was enduring intense pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa and Clarissa were a bit worried and wanted to step forward to help, but Uriah stopped them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry! This is normal. Alfreda can get through it! Her physique is extremely rare. She can perfectly merge with the Elven Mother Tree and achieve transformation and transcendence with its help!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We just need to wait."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa and Clarissa finally relaxed, releasing their power to protect Alfreda, not allowing anyone to interfere with her fusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two days passed quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone could feel Alfreda's cultivation level rapidly increasing, reaching Empyrean Sacredness. Dense green patterns appeared on her skin, and powerful energy burst forth from her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the energy Alfreda emitted even shocked Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her cultivation level has reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness, and it's still rising rapidly!"</span></p></div>
