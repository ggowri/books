        <h1>Chapter 2313 Osborne's Return-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, fresh air!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne practically burst out of the Translocator on the sixth layer, a wave of relief washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, the seventh layer's icy grip hadn't really threatened him, not since he'd unleashed the Flames of the Dark Phoenix. Even without the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's protection, he'd have been fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that bone-chilling cold still got under his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to that, the sixth layer's blizzards felt like a freaking sauna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That trip down to the seventh layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm was a total score!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grin split Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He</span><span> hauled back a hundred and fifty-seven Frost-kissed Hearts! With </span><span>their</span><span> little seventy-thirty deal, that's 110 for </span><span>him</span><span>! But that Primordial threw a hissy fit, so </span><span>he</span><span> had to promise it fifty-seven. Still le</span><span>ft</span><span> </span><span>him</span><span> with a hundred, though!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred Frost-kissed Hearts... If </span><span>he</span><span> gobble</span><span>d</span><span> them all up, </span><span>his</span><span> physical body could easily hit late-stage Sacredness! That'd put </span><span>him</span><span> in the running for strongest body among all the Empyrean Sacredness cultivators!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The best part is, </span><span>he</span><span> only need to siphon off the power of ten Frost-kissed Hearts to juice up the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's Fusion Vessel, and boom! Third foundational carrier, solid as a rock! Then, blending the fourth power into </span><span>his </span><span>Sacred Power will be a walk in the park! Who knows, if </span><span>he</span><span> suck down all hundred, a fourth fusion base might even pop up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His</span><span> master plan is to fuse five powers before </span><span>he</span><span> even th</span><span>ought</span><span> about breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness! Looks like </span><span>he</span><span> might actually pull it off without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Too bad I'm on a clock! Gotta hold my horses until after the state duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And don't forget, on the seventh layer, I rescued Agatha and even managed to swipe </span><span style="font-style: italic;">nine</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> drops of Phoenix Blood, igniting the Flames of the Dark Phoenix! Talk about a power boost! My fire elemental essence has finally caught up with my dark, space, and lightning essences, maybe even edged them out a bit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My overall strength has skyrocketed because of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once I fuse that fire elemental essence into my Sacred Power, my Sacred Power's gonna pack the seriously nasty corrosive punch of the Flames of the Dark Phoenix!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My Sacred Power will be off the charts! I might even be able to hold my own, maybe even win, against an Empyrean Sacredness powerhouse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bottom line, this little field trip to the seventh layer was a slam dunk!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's grin was practically glued to his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the state duel wasn't barreling towards its final day, and if the rules didn't mandate that all contestants should haul back to the Arctic Maw Chasm's first layer for the grand finale, Osborne would've happily stuck around on the seventh layer, hunting down more Frost-kissed Hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd scoured maybe seventy percent of that snow-covered mountain, and the remaining thirty percent probably held at least a few dozen more Frost-kissed Hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hey, beggars couldn't be choosers. Gotta let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Time's ticking away, gotta get back to the first layer! Otherwise, I'll get disqualified for breaking the rules! And then, no zone duel, no Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that sobering thought, Osborne punched the Translocator's activation sequence and kicked off his journey back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasted no time zipping back to the fifth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the sixth day winding down, both the sixth and fifth layers were eerily deserted. Almost everyone had already gone back to the first layer for the final showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the filming gear and referees had already packed up and left the fifth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Translocator's camera was still rolling.</span></p></div>
