        <h1>Chapter 2091 Death Chasm</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the Death Chasm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Uriel turned and pointed at the vast rift in the distance. "Only by entering the Death Chasm can you truly say you've stepped into the Umbra Earth continent! Compared to the Death Chasm, the mushroom forest was just an appetizer&mdash;it's nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the Death Chasm, there are Phantom Worms that are even more dangerous than the Ghostwing Insect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's words plunged the group into silence, fear etched across many faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death Chasm? More dangerous than the mushroom forest?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phantom Worms, stronger than Ghostwing Insects?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere grew tense, and Osborne noticed a flicker of hesitation on several faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed to be reconsidering their quest in the Umbra Earth, contemplating a retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel, unfazed by their reactions, continued, "The Phantom Worm's stealth is superior to that of the Ghostwing Insect. It's faster, stronger in attack, and boasts formidable defenses! You could say it's an enhanced version of the Ghostwing Insect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each Phantom Worm is roughly on par with an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, and some of the more powerful ones rival Ascension Five and even Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings. If you encounter one of those, you'll need to band together and work as a team to stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the real danger in the Death Chasm isn't just the Phantom Worms. It's the Soulreaver Vine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you get ensnared by a Soulreaver Vine, even an Ascension Five or Six Supernal Deity King could be drained of their divine power in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They feast on divine power. Your defenses won't matter; to them, you're just food! Only elemental power can harm the Soulreaver Vine. If you run into one, even several exploration teams working together might not be enough to defeat it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides that, who knows what other dangers lurk within the Death Chasm? The Elf Race hasn't fully explored it yet, so there could be threats even worse than the Phantom Worms and Soulreaver Vines."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the gravity of the situation settled heavily on everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear flickered in their eyes, and more and more began to entertain thoughts of retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Uriel locked eyes with the crowd, a sly smile creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and I almost forgot to mention&mdash;if you want to leave this Umbra Earth continent, you must first pass through the Death Chasm! Until you navigate it, your Spatial Translocator won't work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, a wave of uproar erupted among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? We can't use the Spatial Translocator without going through the Death Chasm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you say so sooner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'd known Umbra Earth was this dangerous, I wouldn't have signed up! Sure, the treasures here are valuable, but life is far more precious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Are you Elf folks hiding this from us on purpose? Trying to lure us in to become your cannon fodder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel merely chuckled at their outrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Elf Race has never forced you into the Umbra Earth. You all coveted the treasures here and insisted on coming yourselves! As for the specifics of what lies in Umbra Earth... do we owe you an explanation? Why should we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the crowd fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His smile was one of arrogance. "Honestly, I could've kept all this to myself. If I hadn't said anything, you'd be left to figure it out with your lives! I could have just let you fend for yourselves without returning to the mushroom forest to rescue you...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason I'm helping you and sharing this information is that the Death Chasm ahead is incredibly complex, filled with countless paths leading to different places, each with its own treasures...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And remember, this Umbra Earth will revert back to Umbra World in a month! I hope each of you can leave with something valuable from your time here, adding more treasures from Umbra Earth to the cosmos..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced around at the group before turning his gaze back to the ominous Death Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I've said all I need to say! The next leg of your exploration in Umbra Earth is up to you. If you want to leave, just follow the largest path through the Death Chasm. The Phantom Worms and Soulreaver Vines there have already been cleared out, so the danger is minimal...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, the treasures along that route have been picked clean by the Elf Race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, if you want to leave, feel free to do so! But if you're after treasure, then go ahead and explore the smaller paths in the Death Chasm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Farewell, everyone! Until we meet again by chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Uriel and his exploration team swiftly departed the platform, disappearing into the gaping maw of the Death Chasm, which resembled the mouth of a colossal beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a wave of chatter erupted among the remaining groups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each exploration team was now in heated discussions about their next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should they rush through the Death Chasm and escape Umbra Earth? Or take their time, risking danger in search of treasures?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pulled his gaze away from the Death Chasm, ignoring the chatter from the other teams, and turned to Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda, biting her lip, glanced at the members of their group before speaking up, "You all heard what Uriel said, right? If anyone has thoughts on this, now's the time to share! Are we leaving quickly, or are we going to explore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, everyone exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed Neville and Arabela looking particularly hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neville finally spoke up, his voice tinged with regret, "I think we should leave as soon as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The dangers of Umbra Earth far exceed what I expected. Just in the mushroom forest, my sister and I almost lost our lives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And according to Uriel, the threats in the Death Chasm are even worse. I'm genuinely afraid that my sister and I might not make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, </span><span>we</span><span> want to leave as soon as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced apologetically at Alfreda, who nodded in understanding. "I get </span><span>it</span><span>! How about the rest of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda turned to the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We want to stay and keep exploring!" Avery declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfrey and Hermione nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly chimed in, "I want to stay too! Sure, Umbra Earth is dangerous, but I'm willing to take that risk!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, what's the point of treasures if we don't dare to chase them? Without some risk, how will we ever discover anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded, then looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm smile, Osborne replied, "I've finally made it to Umbra Earth, so I'm not about to leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda sighed in relief, saying, "Alright then, </span><span>that</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s it</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Neville, Arabela, you two can stay here. I'm sure there are plenty who want to leave quickly; you can team up with them to navigate the Death Chasm together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you're through, you'll be able to use the Spatial Translocator to escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And as for us, let's get moving!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just the Death Chasm, right? We're going to find every last treasure hidden inside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined wave of her hand, she rallied the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p></div>
