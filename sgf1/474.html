        <h1>Chapter 474 Close Quarters</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was resolute in her stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>frowned,</span><span> his worry evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, this is too dangerous! The enemy is strong, and the weakest among those who'll fight are Class A masters, maybe even Class A+ masters could show up. I'm worried I won't be able to protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Clarissa asserted, "Then I have all the more reason to go with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I can't let you face this alone! Plus, I don't need your protection. I'm strong too, you know? I have the Fate Staff. Even Alexander would struggle against me for a while. I can take on several Class A masters easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pretty face wore a smug expression as she finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered Clarissa was only Class B+, but he had forgotten about the Fate Staff, a genuine divine artifact, the weapon of the Goddess of Fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Fate Staff, Clarissa indeed had no trouble handling average Class A masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given her determination, Osborne had no choice but to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, then, come with me. But you must obey my commands and not act recklessly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Clarissa obediently nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll listen to everything you say, Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then turned around, hugged Osborne's neck tightly, looked up into his eyes, and her face quickly flushed a deep red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her rosy lips parted slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly felt his mouth dry, and he asked, "Are you sure, you'll do whatever I say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa seemed to grasp what Osborne meant, yet shyly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'll listen to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathing a sigh of relief, Osborne bent down to kiss Clarissa's red lips, then swept her up in his arms, tearing open a dimensional rift with a swift motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Osborne carried Clarissa through the dimensional rift and back into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Clarissa found herself in the room, her cheeks flushing even deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't resist, only gazing at Osborne with eyes full of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, take me," Clarissa murmured almost in a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words ignited something primal in Osborne, and he could no longer control himself. Gently, he laid Clarissa on the bed and bent down to kiss her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's body tensed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clung tightly to Osborne's head, her neck flushing as she felt his tongue glide from her neck to her ear, her body trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her eyes closed and a smile of bliss on her lips, this was a moment Clarissa had long anticipated and was ready for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, when it finally arrived, she was still nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was tense, and she was unsure of how to respond, so she let Osborne take the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel Clarissa's nervousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't rush the next steps but kissed every inch of her skin, savoring the unique scent of Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt a strange, incredible energy emanating from Clarissa's body and seeping into his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was oblivious to anything else, his eyes only on Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly undid Clarissa's clothes, her body tensing further, utterly naked before Osborne's eyes. Ashamed, she tightly shut her eyes, not daring to look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, too, was excited, his hands trembling as they reached for Clarissa's breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft moan escaped Clarissa, her body shuddering violently, making an involuntary sound that sent Osborne's pulse racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breathing grew heavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back any longer, he bent down and enveloped Clarissa's nipple with his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Clarissa exclaimed, her body stiffening as if electrified, tightly clutching Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to them, a more robust, mysterious energy was emerging from deep within Clarissa, flowing into Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his body about to ignite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he saw no issue with this, assuming it was a normal physiological response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a familiar, terrifying force enveloped the entire villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, a jolt of force caused Clarissa, pinned under Osborne, to twist her head sharply and faint silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a tall silhouette quietly appeared behind Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, what a cozy scene! Seems I've come at a bad time. Should I wait until you're done and then reappear?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A teasing voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the familiar voice, Osborne quickly jumped up, turning around reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Isa, standing behind him and staring at him with a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, what are you doing here?" Osborne asked, trying to sound calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa responded icily, "What, you don't seem happy to see me? But then again, you look like you're having a lot of fun. Excited, aren't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to interrupt your good time, but if I don't stop you </span><span>now</span><span>, you're going to die! Not just you, but your little girlfriend too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exclaimed in surprise, "Isa, what do you mean? If you don't stop me, both Clarissa and I will die?"</span></p></div>
