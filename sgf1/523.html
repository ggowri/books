        <h1>Chapter 523 Stand a Good Chance</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moments later, in the conference hall, all the core executives of the Augustine family from Dampston, even the elite of the younger generation, had gathered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne quickly summarized the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, here's the deal. Our Augustine family in Dampston is actually a branch bloodline of the Augustine family in Newport City. I've called everyone here to discuss whether we should acknowledge this connection and become the ninth branch bloodline family of the Augustine family in Newport City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Osborne finished speaking, the entire conference hall fell into an eerie silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shock and bewilderment were etched on every face, even Isaac's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The revelation had left everyone stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They thought, "Could it be that the Augustine of Dampston is really a branch bloodline split off from the Augustine of Newport? Do we share the same ancestors? Are we related?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family of Newport City was recognized as the oldest and most powerful family in Rosmandi, with a history spanning thousands of years. In recent decades, they had even produced a Godfather, elevating the Augustine family to a level that other ancient families could not match.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Becoming a branch bloodline of the Augustine family of Newport City&mdash;was it a good thing or a bad thing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, it was a good thing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Currently, the Augustine family of Newport City had eight branch bloodline families, five of which were located across Rosmandi, and three abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each of these eight branch bloodline families was exceptionally powerful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least, they were all much stronger than the current Augustine family of Dampston.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their strength stemmed from the support of the Augustine family of Newport City. As branch bloodline families of the Augustine family of Newport City, no one dared to provoke or offend them in their respective regions of development.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was difficult not to become powerful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, after the initial shock, excitement began to dawn on the faces of Isaac and the others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do we even need to think about this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think we should agree to become the ninth branch bloodline family of the Augustine family in Newport City!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absolutely, I agree."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From every perspective, we have no reason to refuse. Having the Augustine family of Newport City as our main bloodline family is a good thing for us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I agree."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The executives of the Augustine family of Dampston voiced their agreement, but ultimately, all eyes turned to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the current Augustine family of Dampston, Osborne was the one who made the final decisions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Isaac's words carried less weight than Osborne's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac also expressed his agreement and looked at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled faintly. Since all the core executives of the Augustine family of Dampston were willing to become the ninth branch bloodline family of the Augustine family of Newport City, he, as an "outsider," naturally wouldn't refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He nodded and said, "In that case, let's vote. Raise your hand if you agree."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, everyone raised their hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Great, unanimous agreement. It's decided then. Our Augustine family of Dampston officially becomes the ninth branch bloodline family of the Augustine family of Newport City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne finished speaking, excitement rippled through the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, quickly invite Mr. Caleb Augustine of the Augustine family of Newport City inside," Isaac urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded and was about to rise when Caleb walked in with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need for trouble, I'm already here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac and the others quickly stood up, looking at Caleb with a hint of nervousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We greet Mr. Caleb Augustine of the main bloodline."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb waved his hand with a smile. "Please, everyone, don't be so formal. From now on, we're all family. Although you're just branch bloodlines, the reason our Augustine family has thrived for thousands of years is that we don't treat our branch bloodlines as mere vassals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Main bloodline and branch bloodline&mdash;they're all part of the Augustine family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If a branch bloodline becomes powerful enough, it can become the new main bloodline. If the main bloodline grows complacent, it may eventually be relegated to a branch bloodline."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb's words left everyone stunned, their mouths agape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't believe it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb smiled faintly. "This is actually a rule set by our shared ancestors. If you ever find yourself in Newport City, you can see it for yourself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In fact, a millennium ago, the Augustine family of Newport City was merely a branch bloodline. It was only after a war nearly wiped out the main bloodline that the Newport City branch emerged, rallying the Augustine family members and forming a new main bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And throughout this thousand-year history, the head of the Augustine family in Newport City has been a branch bloodline member three times."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb's words left everyone even more astonished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan blurted out, unable to hold back his excitement, "A branch bloodline member can become the head of the Newport City Augustine family? Does that mean we..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before he could finish, Brian's face went pale. He quickly covered Nathan's mouth, casting a fearful glance at Caleb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb, however, merely smiled, "Don't worry, what he said is actually correct. Once you all become the ninth branch bloodline of the Augustine family, each of you will have the chance to become the head of the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, you need to be capable of defeating other branch bloodlines and even the main bloodline's competitors."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Caleb spoke, his gaze briefly lingered on Osborne with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think you stand a good chance."</p></div>
