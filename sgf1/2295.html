        <h1>Chapter 2249 Four Arrows-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, don't you even think about throwing in the towel! Eat this punch!" Vadim bellowed, unleashing a bone-chilling force that hurtled straight towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Even the spectators in the stands felt it like a colossal mountain bearing down on them. Everyone could feel their skin tingling, as if it would tear apart under Vadim's overpowering might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vadim's really stepped up his game, no doubt about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Obviously, he was just coasting through the group matches yesterday! But now? He's going all out against Osborne. If that guy doesn't tap out, he's going to be flattened!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He doesn't stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was on the edge of their seats, feeling the sheer force behind Vadim's punches. All eyes were locked on Osborne, eager to see his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would he hunker down and defend?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe try to dodge? Or throw in the towel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held his ground, as cool as a cucumber. He raised his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, deftly pulling back the string as a bolt of Sacred Power materialized in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Vadim's crushing might, Osborne knew he had to fire back with a Sacred Power arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim might be cocky, but given his strength, he had every reason to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in a whole different league compared to the dozen-odd opponents Osborne had faced in the group matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To beat him, Osborne had to up his game&mdash;just a little bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tapped into only a tiny bit of his Sacred Power. Once the arrow took full shape, he let it fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow sliced through the air, heading straight for Vadim's oncoming attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power arrow zoomed towards Vadim's fist. Before the two forces even clashed, Osborne was already yanking back the bowstring again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three more Sacred Power arrows popped into existence and shot off in rapid succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he was done, Osborne slung his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow over his back, his expression as calm as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the first Sacred Power arrow finally collided with Vadim's punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant they met, an explosive force erupted, sending shockwaves rippling outward that made everyone watching from the stands feel a sharp sting on their skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Vadim's terrifying punch was obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the Sacred Power arrow didn't fade; it continued soaring toward Vadim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight shook Vadim to his core, leaving him in disbelief. The audience below shared his shock, their eyes wide. No one had expected that a casual shot from Osborne could actually dismantle Vadim's formidable attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the arrow charged toward him, Vadim reacted instantly, clenching his fist with determination. He swung down with all his might, his strength bolstered by the power of his quasi-Sacred Artifact gauntlets. He knew he had to counter that arrow; it had already lost considerable power from its earlier clash. There was no way it could withstand the force of three thunderous punches barreling down on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could even catch his breath, three more arrows came screaming towards him, each one swifter and more powerful than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim's face darkened in an instant. "Smash them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brought his fists crashing down, but this time, he was up against fully-formed, undamaged arrows. As they just barely brushed past him, Vadim felt a searing, explosive power coursing through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face went pale, and he was rooted to the spot in sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I can't stop them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hopeless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening explosion, the three arrows ripped through his defenses and pierced his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh-oh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the referee snapped out of his daze and sprinted towards Vadim, trying to shield him from Osborne's non-stop onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was a lost cause!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three Sacred Power arrows pierced Vadim's shoulder and abdomen, then erupted into a blinding explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim's battered body went flying out of the ring and crashed to the ground below. He was knocked out cold, completely defeated, not even able to let out a peep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deathly silence fell over the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were on Osborne, who had already stowed his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow. He looked as calm as ever, like he'd seen this coming from a mile away. The shock on everyone's faces was </span><span>evident</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim had been taken down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a jaw-dropping display of skill, Osborne had single-handedly demolished the champion of the last Sect Tournament in the blink of an eye!</span></p></div>
