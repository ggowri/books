        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence scoffed at Osborne's challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! You're just piggybacking on the power of that fancy bow. You think you can order me to release her for a fair fight? You're nowhere near being in my league! At least, not yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grinned smugly and continued, "But here's an idea&mdash;if you can win a match without that bow, I might just give you a chance at a proper showdown. I'm just worried you don't have the balls to take me up on it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned as cold as ice at the proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Win a match without the bow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second's delay, he stashed the Bloodwrought Bow away and calmly replied, "Piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this party started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast a steely glance at Lord Malevolence's warriors standing behind him and shouted, "Who's got the guts to step forward and meet their maker?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent a surge of fury through the group, hitting Maddox and Tyrese especially hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect, summoned by Lord Malevolence from the Racial Convergence Planet. Having just witnessed Osborne take down Ricky with a single arrow, they were furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's arrogant taunts only added fuel to the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were itching to teach him a harsh lesson and avenge Ricky's tragic end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was Maddox who stepped up to the plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take him on! If he could take down Ricky, even with that bow, he's no pushover. You all better not underestimate him. I'll go in there and crush him myself to honor Ricky!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Maddox strode forward, directly facing off against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he did, a few people in the crowd blanched. They had seen Maddox in action. While he might not be on Isa's level, he had single-handedly overpowered Clarissa, Emma, and Austin before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky was an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those present, only Lord Malevolence and Isa had a fighting chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia finally couldn't contain herself and shouted urgently, "Osborne, watch out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, he's a beast! An Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even when Clarissa and the others joined forces, they couldn't beat him and got injured multiple times!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Anastasia's warning, Osborne's face clouded over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While her intention was to apprise him of Maddox's formidable strength, what really caught his attention was that Maddox had repeatedly injured Clarissa, Emma, and Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He locked his cold gaze on Maddox. "You're a dead man! Just like the last one! Your body will be torn to pieces right here on this battlefield!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's face was twisted with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? You think you can take me down? You just got lucky with Ricky. He was nothing but a pawn for you. Without that bow, you're like a toothless predator with delusions of grandeur. You're way out of your league!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll avenge Ricky by taking you out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's dance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Maddox lunged forward, raising his hand. The air around him sparked with a barrage of terrifying lightning bolts that converged into his palm. Then, he unleashed a thunderous punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A colossal fist made entirely of searing lightning rocketed towards Osborne, crackling with raw power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning-formed punch was blindingly fast, closing the gap between them in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just stood there, seemingly caught off-guard, which sent a wave of panic through Clarissa, Emma, Austin, Anastasia, Zoe, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, look out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shrieked in terror. Maddox, an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King, was unleashing his full might in a thirst for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that punch landed, the outcome would be catastrophic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the pandemonium, Osborne finally stirred, but instead of dodging, he shot his hand forward, determined to grab the lightning-charged fist head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's eyes glinted with scorn as he watched Osborne's foolhardy move. He was certain that Osborne would lose at least an arm, if not his life, from the force of his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next moment, his expression froze in sheer disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Maddox's utter shock, Osborne had caught his thunderous punch bare-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-menacing lightning energy now swirled harmlessly around Osborne's arm, crackling and popping like a live electrical cable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's eyes bulged in disbelief. "How on earth is this possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My attack has been intercepted?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very lightning he'd unleashed was now obediently dancing around Osborne's arm. Maddox was completely flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, his cold eyes locked firmly on Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, so this is the extent of your so-called power? Trying to play with lightning in front of me? You don't have a snowball's chance in hell! Let me show you what real power looks like!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a disdainful snort, Osborne reached up and summoned a far more terrifying surge of lightning from the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It crashed down and enveloped his arm, turning it into a searing, crackling purple sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, taste this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Osborne threw a punch, unleashing a far more powerful bolt of lightning that streaked towards Maddox like a meteor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's heart sank like a stone. He could feel the sheer intensity of Osborne's lightning-powered punch; it was </span><span>way</span><span> more powerful than his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no time for hesitation as the punch hurtled towards him at a breakneck pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was steel himself and try to dodge out of the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can dodge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even react, Osborne appeared behind him, amplified by spatial power. In the blink of an eye, Osborne unleashed his Sacred Power, landing a bone-shattering punch right on Maddox's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning punch had been nothing but a decoy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that despite its spectacular appearance, the lightning punch alone wouldn't be enough to truly inflict serious damage on Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His real trump card was the Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in its weakened state, it was still far beyond what Maddox could endure. While Maddox was fixated on the lightning, the Sacred Power struck him with full force, sending him flying across the battlefield. A massive gash opened up on his back, and he crashed right into the lingering lightning punch behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Maddox was engulfed by the explosive lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was aware that Maddox wasn't dead; his strength far exceeded Ricky's, and his vitality was remarkably robust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing him wouldn't be an easy task, especially without the Bloodwrought Bow. Even with Sacred Power, taking down an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King like Maddox was no small feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't have time to waste on Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was still under Lord Malevolence's control, and his only true opponent was Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others? They were nothing to worry about!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he tapped into his spatial power, materializing right in the heart of the lightning storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he unleashed another volley of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was set in a steely resolve. He mercilessly pummeled Maddox with wave after wave of Sacred Power attacks, leaving nothing in reserve. Each strike landed with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Maddox simply couldn't take it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body started to fracture and break apart under the relentless onslaught.</span></p></div>
