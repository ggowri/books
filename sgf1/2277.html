        <h1>Chapter 2240 Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stashed Angela's Peak Lord Token away and cast a wry smile around at the empty surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, he'd gotten his identity token from the Mystic Sirius Sect and officially become an inner disciple at Peak Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Isa, Clarissa, and the others&mdash;where they'd ended up or what had befallen them&mdash;nobody knew, and truth be told, apart from Osborne and Angela, no one seemed to give a hoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made himself at home in his new abode halfway up Peak Seven. It was a snug and peaceful dwelling. The view from his courtyard was simply stunning, with a sea of clouds billowing below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A protective barrier encircled the yard, and only his identity token could grant entry, guaranteeing he wouldn't be bothered while he trained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat cross-legged in the courtyard, gazing out at the clouds, deep in thought about his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I </span><span>gotta</span><span> figure out a way to get to Nebula City, the capital of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. I should pay my respects to my mom from my past life. But she's buried in the Royal Family's Royal Sepulcher. With my current standing, there's no way I can get in. And trying to sneak in? That'd be a death wish!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gaining entry to the Royal </span><span>Family's</span><span> Royal Sepulcher is no walk in the park!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned as he pondered the matter.</span><br><span>For outsiders, there are only two ways to get in. The first is to become a Royal Family guard in the Glorious Divine Kingdom. You'd have to safeguard a member of the Royal Family when they go into the sepulcher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But becoming a Royal Family guard is a real uphill battle. You've </span><span>gotta</span><span> be incredibly powerful and pass a strict background check. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Even if I started prepping right this second, it could take years before I'd stand a chance.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Scrap that option!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second way to get into the Royal </span><span>Family's</span><span> Royal Sepulcher is a bit more straightforward. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The Glorious Divine Kingdom holds large-scale sacrificial ceremonies in the sepulcher during major festivals, and that's my golden opportunity! If I could score an invitation, I'd be in.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to get an invitation, you'd need to be at least the head of a Second-rate Power, like the sect master of the Mystic Sirius Sect...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Right now, that's just a pipe dream for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Looks like my only shot is to get in as a performer.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every ten years, the Glorious Divine Kingdom holds a national competition&mdash;the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel! And the venue is right in the Royal Sepulcher...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If I can take part in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, I can get into the Royal Sepulcher and find an opportunity to pay my respects to my mom from my past life!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne felt a rush of determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He summoned Maddox to ask about the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox paused for a moment, then responded, "Oh, it's </span><span>gonna</span><span> start pretty soon! The cities are already gearing up! The finals will be held in a year!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "A year from now?! Give me the lowdown!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox nodded, itching to explain, "The Glorious Divine Kingdom is split into ten zones. Each zone's got a hundred states, and every state's home to a hundred cities! Only ten teams can enter the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In other words, each zone can only send one team to Nebula City for the showdown. So, if you </span><span>wanna</span><span> take part, you </span><span>gotta</span><span> first rise above the rest in your sect, then in your city, after that in your state, and finally, dominate your zone to be the top dog.</span></p></div>
