        <h1>Chapter 76 The Aberrants</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I should take it step by step and see how things go.&rdquo; Osborne shook his head. He had no idea at all. Osborne could only put this thing aside for the time being and start practicing The Breath of Celestial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The upgrade of Satan&rsquo;s Eye greatly increased his strength. But this was not enough. The effect of The Breath of Celestial was equally terrifying. Osborne had to continue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the next day, Osborne finished washing up early and went to the ward to see Anastasia. Then, he prepared to go to the Radcliffe family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; Isa found Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked at Isa. She was wearing a pair of very short hot pants today. Her legs were beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne swallowed. He almost couldn&rsquo;t help but open Satan&rsquo;s Eye to peek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Why do you look at me like this?&rdquo; Isa couldn&rsquo;t help but glare at Osborne. But she wasn&rsquo;t shy at all. &ldquo;You should find a girlfriend. Otherwise, if I live with you, I&rsquo;m afraid that one day you will try to sleep with me. Should I resist or enjoy it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This is such an awkward question.&rdquo; Isa&rsquo;s teasing made Osborne look embarrassed. He could not stand her boldness. Osborne raised his hands and said, &ldquo;Isa, I am sorry. It&rsquo;s just that you are too beautiful. I couldn&rsquo;t help but look at you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You have good taste. I am indeed beautiful. Any man would take a second look at me. I don&rsquo;t blame you,&rdquo; Isa said proudly. &ldquo;Okay. I came to you to tell you that the metahuman killer has confessed. His name is Milo. He is a C-level psychic and belongs to the Aberrants. The one who hired him to kill you is Justin from the Caldwell family. Justin is not worth mentioning. But you must be careful of the Aberrants.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Justin indeed,&rdquo; Osborne snorted coldly. He was not surprised by the result. It was within his expectations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Is that Aberrants very powerful?&rdquo; Osborne asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Isa heard this, a solemn look appeared on her pretty face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She nodded and said, &ldquo;They are powerful. A hundred years ago, the Aberrants were the absolute king of Rosmandi&rsquo;s underground world. Their influence spread to every corner of Rosmandi, whether it was a bustling commercial district or a dark slum. They controlled the order of the underground world and used cruel means to protect their interests. Any force that dared to challenge them would suffer a bloody massacre. And each of their members is a metahuman or martial artist who has undergone brutal training. At their peak, their number exceeded 100,000.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Isa finished speaking, Osborne was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were more than just powerful. But, how come he had never heard of such a powerful organization?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne asked his question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa immediately laughed and joked, &ldquo;Are you scared? I told you that it was a hundred years ago. The Aberrants was defeated by Godfather a long time ago. In Rosmandi&rsquo;s current underground world, Godfather is the king.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa showed her respect for Godfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne rolled his eyes at her. He was really frightened by the strength of the Aberrants just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The Aberrants has been wiped out. So, what do I have to worry about?&rdquo; Osborne said unhappily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa said seriously again, &ldquo;If you think so, you are doomed. Decades ago, the Aberrants was indeed defeated by Godfather. But until the end, the mysterious leader of the Aberrants was not killed. Even Godfather couldn&rsquo;t do anything to him, he escaped from Rosmandi. Over the years, the Aberrants has been recovering its strength. Its activities in several small countries have become more and more active. Recently, it has begun to infiltrate Rosmandi. Everyone knows that the Aberrants will not give up the underground world of Rosmandi. One day, they will return to Rosmandi and challenge Godfather.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne opened his mouth wide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Godfather failed to kill the mysterious leader of the Aberrants. Moreover, now they were going to attack Rosmandi again. In the underground world of Rosmandi today, Godfather had absolute control. Since the Aberrants dared to come back, they must be confident. In other words, even if the strength of the Aberrants was not as good as that of Godfather, it would not be much worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, Osborne felt the pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He frowned and said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t offended the Aberrants yet. After all, they just accepted Justin&rsquo;s employment. Even if the mission failed, they won&rsquo;t hate me, right?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa smiled faintly and said, &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s just a mission failure, the Aberrants won&rsquo;t hate you. But if you kill their people, that&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was stunned and frowned. &ldquo;What do you mean? I don&rsquo;t think I killed Milo. Since the Aberrants is so powerful, I can&rsquo;t offend them for the time being. So, I might as well let Milo go.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo; Isa shrugged. She smoothed her messy hair with her hand. &ldquo;Milo is dead. He couldn&rsquo;t withstand my experiment and exploded to death.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What? You used Milo for human experiments?&rdquo; Osborne&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;Is he really dead?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa shrugged. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really dead. He was a C-level psychic. But he was so fragile that he died in just two days. The Aberrants will definitely hold you responsible for this. So, I&rsquo;m reminding you to be careful of them. They are very vindictive.&rdquo;</p></div>
