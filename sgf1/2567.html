        <h1>Chapter 2464 Threat</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian's eyes concealed intense killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Except for those princes and princesses in the royal family, no one had ever dared to speak to Ian like this. Most importantly, Osborne's name suddenly reminded him of something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That lowly prince back then was also named Osborne. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Unfortunately, they are not the same person. Their age, appearance, and personality are all different, even their gaze is completely different. That prince would never dare to speak to me like this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That prince's eyes would always flash with fear whenever he saw me. He was afraid of me and wanted to avoid me, but I was like his nightmare. As long as Prince Brent gave the order, I would ruthlessly beat, humiliate, and torment him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, the more he resisted, the worse it got!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Ian smiled. He continued reminiscing, "I really miss those days. Not everyone gets the chance to beat and humiliate a prince."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, that prince was eventually expelled from the royal family and the Glorious Divine Kingdom. He left the Racial Convergence Planet, so I lost a lot of fun. However, that prince's body suffered irreparable internal injuries. I&rsquo;m afraid he still hasn&rsquo;t broken through to Empyrean Sacredness even now. He might be hiding on some small life-bearing planet, living humbly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Ian looked at Osborne again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shared the same name as the lowly prince who was expelled from the royal family over a thousand years ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they were not the same person, Ian was very displeased with Osborne just because of his name.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, how dare Osborne scold him and ruin his plans?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Ian's killing intent grew stronger. "When I get the chance, I'll make you disappear forever. It's been over a thousand years since I last humiliated and tormented that prince. I can relive a bit of that feeling through someone like you who shares his name."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking this, Ian's face was filled with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was watching Ian. He didn't know what Ian was thinking, but with Satan's Eyes, he could clearly see the killing intent hidden deep in Ian's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian still wanted to kill him and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne never expected Ian to give up killing him and Leroy because of the laws and ancestral teachings of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said those words just for others to hear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he truly wanted to protect Leroy's life, relying on laws and ancestral teachings was useless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne was the prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom in his previous life. He lived in Nebula City and saw royal family members every day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew too well how royal family members conducted themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he asked them face-to-face whether they violated the laws and ancestral teachings of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, they would, of course, righteously tell everyone that they would never go against the laws and ancestral teachings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in secret, what are laws? Who cares about them?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are royal family members, so they are superior and can decide others' life and death. Laws are what they use to control others, their weapon!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for ancestral teachings, they are only remembered during ancestral rituals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At other times, who would care?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, the ancestors can't come back to life, and no one dares to say anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, royal family members often trample on the law and violate ancestral teachings, so no one cares at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne has not yet used the real means to control Ian and make him dare not retaliate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne asked Ian through Telepathy, "General Ian Augustine, what do we need to do for you to let us go?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Noticing Osborne was using Telepathy to communicate with him, Ian immediately sneered, thinking Osborne was begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered in his heart, "So, you act tough on the surface, but secretly beg me for mercy? Too bad, it's already too late! Since you embarrassed me in front of everyone, you're doomed! However, since you're begging me, of course, I'll give you a glimmer of hope."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Ian said through Telepathy, "You want me to let you go? It's simple. Have her hand over all her resources to me willingly. Also, you should give me all the resources you have. Then, I won't do anything to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Ian confidently looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He believed Osborne would agree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, compared to his life, what are some resources worth?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Ian was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Ian's words, Osborne felt in his heart that Ian was indeed shameless, wanting to seize his and Leroy's resources.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "General Ian Augustine, your request is too much. These are resources we worked hard to find, and we absolutely won't give them to you for nothing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, a trace of ferocity flashed in Ian's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through Telepathy, he said coldly, "Just wait to die! Man, do you think you can scare me with laws and ancestral rules? Hahaha! Ridiculous! As long as I don't kill you publicly, no one will do anything to me. Once the zone duel is over, I'll find you. I guarantee you'll disappear without a trace, leaving no evidence!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And also, your family and friends will die because of you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered upon hearing this, "Oh really? I'm so scared! You say no one can do anything to you, but I don't think so. I once heard from a friend that over a thousand years ago, you sneaked into Princess Elisha's residence and spied on her bathing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My friend happens to have evidence, and he even showed me the footage you personally took. I must say, Princess Elisha's figure is flawless!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, Princess Elisha is the Crown Prince's favorite consort. If the Crown Prince finds out you spied on Princess Elisha bathing, you might meet a terrible end, and even everyone in your branch bloodline could be executed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Osborne sneered, "You want to kill me? Go ahead and try! If anything happens to me or Leroy, I guarantee my friend will immediately release the evidence he has!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, the fact that you spied on and recorded Princess Elisha bathing will spread across the entire Racial Convergence Planet. Not only will the Crown Prince be furious, but even the Glorious Divine Emperor will be enraged."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, this is a royal scandal!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne spoke, Ian's expression could no longer remain calm. He suddenly stood up, staring at Osborne in disbelief, his face full of panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne heard Ian's terrified voice in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What nonsense are you talking about? How dare you accuse me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "General Ian Augustine, you should know better than I do whether I'm accusing you falsely. Since you won't admit it, I'll make it clearer. It was Prince Brent who ordered you to secretly film the video, right? Prince Brent admires Princess Elisha, but he didn't dare to spy on her himself, so he commanded you to do it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, he can use this matter to control you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, walls have ears. My resourceful friend happened to learn about this and even got the evidence!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now I just want to ask you one question."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you still want us to hand over the resources to you? Do you still want to kill us? If so, then let's go down together!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we die, all your family and Prince Brent will die too."</span></p></div>
