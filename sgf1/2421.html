        <h1>Chapter 2334 Trounce Horace-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace was banged up pretty bad in the fight with Agatha, but his healing powers were something else. Now, he was almost back in tip-top shape. When he caught wind of Osborne and the others approaching, he cracked open his eyes, a cold, steely glint flashing in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his eyes zeroed in on Broderick and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sneer on his face, he jeered, "Well, well, Broderick and Benson. You two have joined forces, huh? Figuring that since I got the better of me by Agatha, you've got a shot at taking me down? If that's the game plan, then come at me together! Even after that loss to Agatha, I'm still the top dog in this state duel, second to none. You two don't stand a snowball's chance in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace oozed confidence as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick and Benson exchanged a quick look. Then Broderick shot back coolly, "Horace, you're full of hot air! Even if we're not in your league, we're not that desperate to team up against you. And besides, we're not the ones here for a scrap with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's him&mdash;Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace's jaw dropped. "Not you two, but him? Some guy ranked over a hundred, just got lucky and racked up some points? He thinks he can throw down with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's coming to challenge me? Absurd!" Horace's face clouded over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick kept his voice steady. "Horace, you haven't bothered to check the rankings lately, right? You'd better take a gander before you make a fool of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace furrowed his brow but quickly peeked at the rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second he took in the numbers, his eyes popped wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whipped his head back to Broderick and Benson. "Your scores have each tanked by hundreds of thousands, while his has shot up to 9.3 million! So you both got your butts kicked by him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick and Benson nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bet! We've both been beaten. Now it's your turn! Once we get rid of you, he'll go after Agatha for the championship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace's face contorted with rage. "What a load of bull! There's no way he can beat me! Even if he took you down, he's no match for me. The only one who's got a shot at challenging Agatha for the title is me&mdash;Horace! No one else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Horace sprang to his feet, his expression icy as he stared daggers at Osborne. "As long as I'm around, you don't have the right to challenge Agatha. I'll wipe the floor with you in a heartbeat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "Is that so? Then let's quit wasting time. Let's rumble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, he drew his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace's face turned as gloomy as a thundercloud. He readied his defensive Sacred Artifact, clutching the Frost-invoking Canvas tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of the Frost-invoking Canvas, both Benson and Broderick flinched, a glimmer of fear in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara and Leroy wore grim expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, watch out for his Frost-invoking Canvas! It's no ordinary Sacred Artifact..." Clara cautioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "The power of a Sacred Artifact boils down to the person using it. No matter how badass an artifact is, it's nothing in the hands of an amateur."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne meant his words to calm Clara down, but Horace took them as a direct slap in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Osborne was dissing his skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His temper flared up, and his gaze turned even frostier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so green! You have no clue how powerful the Frost-invoking Canvas is when I wield it! In this whole state duel, apart from Agatha, no one can take a hit from it!</span></p></div>
