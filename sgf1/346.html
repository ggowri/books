        <h1>Chapter 346 The Seventh Elemental Essence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob and Layla were surprised that Osborne suddenly appeared and knocked the last enemy into the sea with one punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you are not dead yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you are still alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob and Layla exclaimed, unable to conceal their excitement. They had initially thought that Osborne had been killed, given how formidable the enemies were this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even they would surely die if the fight continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had already given up hope inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, Osborne suddenly emerged, and there was even something wrong with the enemies, distracting them in the midst of battle. They seized the opportunity to eliminate two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last one was also seriously injured by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unexpected turn of events left Jacob and Layla overwhelmed with astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I'm not dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a grin, Osborne targeted the metal metahuman in the sea through Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jacob, Layla, don't waste time. Go back quickly and leave this to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne promptly dived into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob and Layla glanced at each other, worried that he was no match for that metahuman, but in the end, they chose to believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they quickly turned around and headed back toward the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering the sea, Osborne swiftly manipulated the water, causing the surrounding seawater to part. He effortlessly caught up with the metal metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Osborne's punch badly injured him, and blood gushed from his mouth.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon realizing that Osborne was pursuing him and could control seawater, he immediately stopped in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he knew that his speed in the water would never match Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at Osborne, he bit his lip and said, "Why were you able to escape? How could you break through my metal prison? And what about Kyle and Eric? How are they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Your metal prison is indeed interesting, but it's still far from enough to trap me. As for Kyle and Eric, they should be waiting for you in hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your action has failed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened considerably. Although he had already anticipated Kyle and Eric's fate, hearing Osborne confirm their deaths still broke his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Osborne. "I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered. A desperate Class A- metahuman's strength could be terrifying. Though unafraid, he found it beneath him to engage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he narrowed his eyes and projected another illusion into the metahuman's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His long, blood-red hair grew swiftly, piercing fiercely into the metahuman's body </span><span>before tightly wrapping around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waking up from the illusion, the metahuman had already become Osborne's prisoner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His long, blood-red hair possessed extraordinary powers that completely suppressed the metahuman's soul of powers, making him unable to use his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was driven to despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Now, answer my questions. If you are honest, I'll ensure a comfortable death for you. Otherwise, you will die in the most painful way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metahuman snorted with laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, trying to get information from me? Dream on! We're from Ghost Ship, and we'll be back! Then, it'll be the end of the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family will be destroyed, and so will you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one can save you! I will wait for you in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, black blood suddenly flowed out from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, Osborne hurried to the metahuman's side, only to see his thirst for life rapidly disappear and his body corrode at an alarming rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He died!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had assumed that he could get some information from the metahuman by controlling his body and suppressing his power. However, he hadn't expected the metahuman to be so decisive. He actually bit the poison capsule hidden in his teeth and committed suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This shocked Osborne extremely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Class A- metahuman would undoubtedly be a high-ranking figure in any formidable organization. Yet, he harbored a poison capsule in his teeth, prepared to end his life at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ghost Ship was so scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without delay, Osborne gazed at the rapidly corroding corpse and snorted coldly, his ocular energy enveloping it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he felt his metal elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Swallow," Osborne murmured, and Satan's Eye promptly began its consumption. In moments, the metahuman's metal elemental essence was completely absorbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gained another elemental essence, the metal one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the seventh elemental essence that he possessed. Once it was fused, his Devil's Light would be enhanced again and reach the terrifying sixth level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne was not in a hurry to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fusion with the fifth-level Devil's Light last time nearly caused him to collapse physically. If he hadn't absorbed the power of the blood diamonds in time to enhance his physical fitness, he would have perished long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that merging with the sixth-level Devil's Light would be even more perilous, he was not confident despite his current robust physical condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I'll merge with the sixth-level Devil's Light once my physical fitness reaches Class A!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he set the matter aside and hurriedly made his way out of the sea toward the </span><span>Alisa Ship.</span></p></div>
