        <h1>Chapter 989 See Through</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne unleashed his Spirit Realm, revealing the presence of the two assassins and effortlessly dodging their sneak attack, the pair felt a wave of nausea wash over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was already the fourth Realm he had mastered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't wrap their heads around it. They thought, "How could anyone possibly control four Realms simultaneously? Does that mean Osborne has achieved mastery over four types of power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For most metahumans, it was exceedingly difficult to grasp even a single Realm. To manage one Realm at all was a mark of genius, an indication that they'd have a good shot at breaking into the Godson Rankings and becoming among the strongest below Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who could manipulate two Realms were practically a rarity&mdash;few could even count them on one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, effortlessly wielding four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Class S assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization exchanged glances, their expressions shifting to one of grave concern. Their confidence was dwindling, and they began to question whether they could actually kill Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't just any Class S&mdash;they were among the stronger ones, firmly rooted in the middle ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as they stood side by side, facing Osborne not too far away, a sense of despair began to creep in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, we have to take him out! I refuse to believe he can pull off a fifth Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they steeled themselves yet again, quickly shattering Osborne's Spirit Realm and vanishing into stealth once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they failed to realize was the cold smirk spreading across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally found some openings," Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two Class S killers had been constantly employing their Stealth Art right in front of him. At first, Osborne couldn't detect them at all, relying solely on his Satan's Eye for early warnings to activate his Realms and locate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he never gave up trying to crack their Stealth Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept his Satan's Eye active, scrutinizing their movements with keen eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a while, nothing came to light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just moments ago, when he activated his Spirit Realm, he suddenly noticed the distinct way their Stealth Art interacted with it, which was unlike anything he'd seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that revelation, Osborne quietly began to weave a subtle layer of mental strength around himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Discreet and nearly undetectable, this mental strength was almost insignificant on its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, when the assassins got close, Osborne immediately sensed their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could track their stealthy fluctuations with the mental strength he'd deployed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A satisfied grin spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered, "I might not be able to manifest a fifth Realm, but that's okay! I've already unraveled your Stealth Art!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He darted to his left, channeling the explosive power of his Divine Bone through his right leg, and launched a kick with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first glance, the area appeared empty; nothing was there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next instant, a scream pierced the air as an assassin was struck squarely in the chest by Osborne's foot. The sickening crack of bones echoed, and blood burst from the assassin's mouth as he was sent flying, crashing into a large tree with enough force to bring it crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he struggled to raise his head, the assassin's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you find me? How could you see through my Stealth Art? It's the pinnacle of what the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization offers! You shouldn't have been able to see me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be a fluke! It has to be!" he stammered, shock flooding his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely chuckled, dismissing his feeble words. He stepped back momentarily, then launched a fierce roundhouse kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>second Class</span><span> S assassin had managed to creep up behind him, lurking just 16 feet away, oblivious to Osborne's awareness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was preparing to strike, but by then, it was far too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With blinding speed, Osborne closed the distance, and the assassin hastily crossed his arms in an attempt to block the incoming assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne's Divine Bone-powered kick shattered through his defense like a twig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the blow sent the second assassin hurtling through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arm twisted grotesquely at an unnatural angle, his chest caved in, and he spewed blood&mdash;fragments of internal organs mingled with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crumpled to the ground, eyes wide with horror, gazing up at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell? How is this happening?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, a calm confidence radiating from him. "Nothing is impossible! You think you can keep using your Stealth Art against me, expecting I won't see the cracks? You've got some serious misplaced confidence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already figured out your little tricks. You thought you could ambush me? That's just asking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's time for you to join Scarlett in the afterlife!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those final words, Osborne vanished, reappearing right in front of a Class S assassin. The look of terror on the assassin's face was priceless as Osborne delivered a brutal kick that obliterated his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just like that, a second assassin fell as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Lambert family's elite fighters, led by Greyson, finally arrived at the scene.</span></p></div>
