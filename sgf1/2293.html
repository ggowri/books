        <h1>Chapter 2248 Provocation-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Angela tuned in to the chatter around her, her expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne picked a fight with Vadim? And he bet a hundred Sacred Crystals on himself to win the championship?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but feel he was taking unnecessary risks.</span><br><span>He's getting a bit too full of himself, even for my standards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it's because he's new to the Mystic Sirius Sect and has no idea how powerful Vadim really is. Or maybe yesterday's matches were just too easy for him, and now he's getting carried away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betting on himself to win, and a whopping hundred Sacred Crystals! He's really riled up Vadim. I just hope they don't face each other too soon, or his chances of making it into the top ten will go down the drain, and he might end up at the bottom of the pack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shook her head and let out a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the entire Peak Seven, Osborne was the only one who'd managed to make it into the top twenty. She had no choice but to pin all her hopes on him, secretly hoping he could make a splash and at least secure a spot in the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Angela didn't dare to set her expectations too high; deep down, she didn't really think Osborne could pull it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attention, everyone! The top twenty matches are about to begin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All contestants for the top twenty, please come up to draw lots!" an Elder from Mystic Sirius Sect announced, his voice booming across the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes wide, rising to his feet as he made his way to the stage, ready to draw his lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne felt a chilling gaze fixed on him from the side. Turning his head, he found Vadim standing there, a cold smirk plastered on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, Vadim's voice echoed in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're in big trouble! I've got it all planned out. I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> be your first opponent! Hahaha. You'll end up flat on your back in the hospital! You thought you could mess with me? You're as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Vadim, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Vadim has rigged the draw?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But considering Vadim was Lenny's nephew, it made sense he could pull some strings to ensure they faced off right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Osborne wasn't intimidated in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained completely unfazed. He just flashed a smile at Vadim and said, "Hope you won't live to regret this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took to the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, it was time to draw lots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got number one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd be the first to go up against the other contestant who'd also drawn number one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot a look at Vadim, who'd just finished drawing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catching Osborne's eye, Vadim let out a sneer and waved the number in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Number one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no doubt Vadim had rigged the draw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First match&mdash;Vadim from Peak One versus Osborne from Peak Seven! Contestants, get ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Elder made the announcement, the crowd went wild. Excitement was written all over countless faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here it comes! Here it comes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought they'd go up against each other this early!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The defending champion and the front-runner up against the most unexpected wildcard! Hahaha, is the wildcard's journey about to end before it even begins?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you reckon he'll throw in the towel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most likely! If he doesn't, Vadim will wipe the floor with him! He won't be fit to continue in the tournament after that&mdash;he's surely headed for last place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were him, I'd bail out right away! Vadim is a beast. Losing to him is no disgrace, and admitting defeat isn't embarrassing. After all, a good ranking matters more than blind pride!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! He's probably kicking himself for getting on Vadim's bad side. Who'd have thought they'd meet in the very first match..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yikes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's chatter only made Vadim's smile widen. He dashed up to the stage, beckoning Osborne with a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, get up here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you just so cocky? If you've got the guts, don't you dare surrender! I promise I won't kill you. I'll just keep you in bed for a few months!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he wore an expression of pure provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, stepping onto the stage.</span></p></div>
