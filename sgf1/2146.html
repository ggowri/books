        <h1>Chapter 2135 Alfreda's Fierce Battle With Uriel</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alfreda regained her freedom, there was no time for surprise or to ponder how Osborne had managed to shatter Uriel's Prison of Radiant Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The threat was still looming, and Uriel's terrifying attack was already hurtling toward them, leaving no room to evade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel, an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, was intent on obliterating them in an instant. He held nothing back; any Ascension Six Supernal Deity King would feel a wave of despair facing such an onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfreda was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luminous Elven Wings!" she shouted, summoning her ultimate trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the radiant Luminous Elven Wings unfurled from her back, enveloping both her and Osborne in a protective cocoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, a blinding beam of light collided with the wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the impact sent Alfreda and Osborne flying, but the formidable defense of the Luminous Elven Wings spared them from harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait... what?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luminous Elven Wings?!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, you're just an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King, and yet you've mastered Luminous Elven Wings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's expression hardened </span><span>dramatically,</span><span> disbelief etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jealousy flickered in his eyes as he took in the sight of Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Luminous Elven Wings were one of the Elf Race's most powerful secret techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after breaking through to Ascension Seven, Uriel had never been able to grasp its essence. The fact that Alfreda, someone he had dismissed, could wield such power was infuriating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It implied that her talent might even surpass his own&mdash;a notion Uriel, proud and arrogant, could hardly accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive! I didn't realize, Princess Alfreda, that you had been hiding your abilities so well! Mastering Luminous Elven Wings at such a young age without revealing it to anyone&mdash;who would have thought your talent was this extraordinary?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I have even more reason to kill you!" Uriel's voice turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Luminous Elven Wings spread wide, revealing Alfreda and Osborne within, she locked eyes with Uriel, her anger flaring. "Kill me? Uriel, do you really think you </span><span>can? I used to respect you! After all, a thousand years ago, you saved many from the Sacred Dragon Clan's genius, and those people are now influential figures in Elf City!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, we are enemies! If you want to kill me, come and try!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My cultivation level may not match yours, but I won't cower!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, her eyes sparkled with fierce resolve and defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's repeated ambushes had pushed her past her limits. If it hadn't been for Osborne breaking the Prison of Radiant Light, she would have been in serious danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel couldn't help but burst into laughter, his expression dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you credit, Princess Alfreda. Your talent is impressive, mastering Luminous Elven Wings at such an early stage&mdash;something I could never achieve in my lifetime! But do you really think you can stand against me? You have no idea how powerful I've become! Even with Luminous Elven Wings, you won't survive against me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Uriel suddenly turned his attention to the blue-skinned Umbra World creature nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of mental energy rippled through the air, and to Alfreda's shock, the creature nodded and stepped back, seemingly content to watch the spectacle unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I've struck a deal with him. He's allowing me to deal with you first before deciding the fate of the Sacred Artifact-level Palace!" Uriel declared, taking slow, deliberate steps toward Alfreda, his murderous intent intensifying with each stride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's expression shifted to one of seriousness as she gripped the Arcane Staff of Nature tightly. Although she had confidence in her abilities, the opponent before her was none other than the famous Uriel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation level towered over hers, leaving her feeling uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne placed a hand on her shoulder, his voice steady and cold. "If you're not sure, let me take the lead!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This bastard has ambushed us twice, and I'd love nothing more than to give him a proper beating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's panic faded at his words, yet she shook her head firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Osborne, leave this to me!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see if there's still a gap between us! He's the third Oracle Heir of the Ethereal Elven Temple, and I want to defeat him myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a twinge of regret but nodded thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, but be careful! This guy has two lifetimes of experience and is stronger than you. He'll be tough to handle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda responded, her determination shining through, "I know. If it comes to it, I'll signal for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her resolve hardening, she faced Uriel, resolve in her eyes. "Uriel, come and fight me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel furrowed his brow, casting a puzzled glance at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was strange; he had previously dismissed Osborne as just Alfreda's sidekick, clearly sensing that Osborne's cultivation was only Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel mused to himself, "I thought this guy was just Alfreda's lackey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But judging from their conversation just now, it doesn't seem to be the case. It appears that in their duo, this human takes the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hell, Alfreda even admitted he's stronger than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, why would she say that if she couldn't handle it, this guy would step in?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what the hell for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How on earth can an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, a total wash-out, be stronger than Alfreda, an Ascension Six?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And let's not forget, Alfreda has even mastered the Luminous Elven Wings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even I have to take Alfreda seriously when she's got those wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Humph! It's definitely just a load of hocus-pocus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the retreating Osborne once more, Uriel locked eyes with Alfreda, challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then bring it on! Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the battle erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Uriel's overwhelming power, Alfreda knew she couldn't hold back. She unleashed the deadly forbidden technique of the Nature Elf Clan&mdash;Temporal Amber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uriel, let's see how you feel about being trapped!" she yelled as emerald light surged around him, seeking to entomb Uriel in amber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha!" Uriel scoffed, summoning an explosion of radiant energy that transformed him into a glowing sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's Temporal Amber couldn't even form around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, you're far too naive! You think your Temporal Amber can hold me? You still have much to learn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung his hand violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tidal wave of light surged forward, catching Alfreda off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't imagined her Temporal Amber would have no effect at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfreda quickly regained her composure, spreading her Luminous Elven Wings once more for protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's fierce attack collided with her wings, but Alfreda remained unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda taunted, "Is that all you've got, Uriel? I expected more from you!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your attacks can't break my Luminous Elven Wings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's expression darkened as jealousy flared in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at the radiant wings, wishing he could tear them apart and wear them himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, you're too arrogant! This is just the beginning! I only used thirty percent of my power earlier!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll soon know true despair!"</span></p></div>
