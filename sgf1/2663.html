        <h1>Chapter 2546 Unable to Break Through Empyrean Sacredness-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's feeling upon entering the Enlightenment State this time was completely different from every previous time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed to be in the midst of chaos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt as if he were wrapped in egg fluid, inside an egg about to hatch, or as if he had returned to the womb, nestled in the placenta.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt as if there was nothing around him, yet everything at the same time&mdash;time, space, elemental forces, and the world had all vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the key is, Osborne felt very comfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt warm all over, with every cell in his body exchanging information and energy with the outside, as if merging with his surroundings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wished he could stay in this state forever and never wake up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this state, he didn't notice the intense changes happening within his body. His body, soul, and even Sacred Power were rapidly advancing until they reached a limit, and Osborne suddenly regained some consciousness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My cultivation level can't be suppressed anymore! I'm about to break through to Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Osborne regained consciousness, his expression changed involuntarily, and he grew a bit anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't break through! I still need to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and enter Necropolis City! If I break through to Empyrean Sacredness now, I'll lose the chance to join the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, won't be able to enter the Royal Sepulcher of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, won't be able to pay respects to my mother from my past life, won't be able to..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, a strong obsession arose in Osborne's mind at this moment&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He must not break through to Empyrean Sacredness yet!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, his body was like a balloon, with Sacred Power surging wildly. No matter how Osborne tried to suppress it, the Sacred Power kept growing. If he didn&rsquo;t break through his cultivation level soon to make his body a larger vessel, the terrifying Sacred Power would burst his body apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne couldn&rsquo;t stop the rise of Sacred Power. If he didn&rsquo;t want to break through his cultivation level, he had to find a way to prevent this surging power from bursting his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Release it outside?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly dismissed this idea. His body was a closed container, and forcibly releasing the surging power would be like creating a hole in the container.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Creating a hole is easy, but returning to normal would be difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Doing so would not only release the surging power but also his potential, talent, vital essence, soul power, and more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His future would be greatly affected as a result.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was equivalent to directly lowering his limits and weakening his potential.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If the power can't be released directly, then find a way to store it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth; he suddenly thought of a way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surging power pushed him to the Empyrean Sacredness level, and he could no longer suppress it. Since that was the case, he decided not to suppress it but to choose a container to temporarily store this surging power. Later, when he truly broke through to Empyrean Sacredness, he would reclaim this power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, when he breaks through to primary Empyrean Sacredness and reclaims this power, it might directly make him mid Empyrean Sacredness or even advanced Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could instantly raise several cultivation levels!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne's eyes lit up, but he quickly encountered another problem.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is, where should this surging power be stored? What "container" could help him temporarily store this power?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was still in a state of chaos.</span></p></div>
