        <h1>Chapter 2659 Ancient Battlefield</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne stood mid-air, staring at the surroundings, stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his pupils contracted sharply, as if he had seen something unbelievable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon closer observation, he noticed the surroundings were extremely dark, filled with ruins and craters, resembling an utterly devastated and vast battlefield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What truly shocked Osborne was that, at this very moment, countless powerful beings were fiercely battling on this battlefield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In front of Osborne, a massive divine dragon soared into the sky, its sharp claws tearing open the abdomen of a giant insect. The insect's blood and entrails gushed out, splashing onto the dragon, effortlessly corroding its sturdy scales.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive insect morphed like flowing water, swiftly enveloping the divine dragon. In the blink of an eye, the dragon's body completely vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, more divine dragons charged at the massive insect, leaving terrifying wounds on its body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eventually, the giant insect was killed and heavily slammed to the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Osborne's left, a group of winged tigers was attacking a group of winged humanoid creatures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those are warriors from the Angel Clan!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tigers roared toward the sky, unleashing endless thunder explosions, but they couldn't kill the warrior from the Angel Clan and were ultimately all slain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, a massive divine elephant charged over, its long trunk instantly wrapping around the Angel Clan warrior, then easily stomping him to death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the divine elephant didn&rsquo;t fare much better; it was pinned to the ground by the Titan and easily blasted away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That Titan was absolutely massive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Osborne's right, a group of stones was battling a group of plants, that is, the Silicon-based Lifeform was fighting the Plant Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, on the ruins of this shattered battlefield, all kinds of thrilling battles erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Various creatures from the Bug Clan, Beast Clan, Spirit Clan, and Plant Clan clashed and fought fiercely. Even numerous diverse Silicon-based Lifeforms joined the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a truly brutal war!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every moment, countless creatures perish. One second, they just defeated their opponent. The next, a stronger being appears and easily takes them down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such scenes keep repeating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Exactly! Repeating!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What Osborne saw wasn't real. All the creatures he saw were just power projections. They seemed to be reenacting a very ancient battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, not far away, an Elf Race warrior was slapped to death by a Sacred Dragon Clan warrior. The Sacred Dragon Clan warrior shouted excitedly but was soon punched to death by an Angel Clan warrior. The Angel Clan warrior didn&rsquo;t celebrate for long before being killed instantly by an unknown force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the next second, the Elf Race warrior reappeared and was slapped to death again by the Sacred Dragon Clan warrior. Then, the Sacred Dragon Clan warrior shouted once more, only to be punched to death again by the Angel Clan warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This battle is looping," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he stood at the center of the ancient battlefield, surrounded by terrifying fights. The battles kept looping, never ending.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne thought, "What's going on? Is this the world inside the Eighth Skyfall Casket? This is completely different from what Frederick described about the Ninth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t dare to move, because although the battles around him were fake, merely looping this ancient fight, the power projections were real.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that if he joined the fight, his body would be instantly blown apart. Every being around him displayed power far beyond Frederick's, at least reaching true Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, or even higher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, these battles could loop endlessly, but if Osborne were killed, he might not reappear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What the hell is going on?" Osborne couldn't figure it out, so he immediately summoned Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Primordial landed on Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the surrounding Ancient Battlefield and the terrifying battles looping endlessly, Primordial couldn't help but be stunned for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, what the hell is going on here?" Osborne couldn't hold back and asked urgently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial didn't answer and kept staring at the battlefield. After a long time, he finally said, "This is likely the battle scene of the former Cosmic Tempestuous Battle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned. "Cosmic Tempestuous Battle?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said seriously, "I once told you, after the explosion of the Chaotic World, this cosmos emerged and gradually gave birth to various unique Acquired Creatures. These Acquired Creatures can generally be divided into three categories: Carbon-based Lifeform, Silicon-based Lifeform, and Singular Lifeform. You remember that, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Of course. You mentioned that Carbon-based Lifeforms can be subdivided into Spirit Clan, Beast Clan, Bug Clan, and Plant Clan. Among them, humans belong to the Spirit Clan and are closely related to the Elf Race and Angel Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "That's right. After so many Acquired Creatures emerged in the cosmos, battles naturally occurred to compete for resources or to become rulers or those in power. They wanted to dominate the cosmos and take control of it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Therefore, under such circumstances, a great war was bound to erupt. Once it broke out, it would spread to every corner of the cosmos. No race could escape it; as long as they were strong enough, they would inevitably be drawn into the war."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such battles that engulf the entire cosmos are called Cosmic Tempestuous Battles. In fact, before Empress Kira ruled the cosmos, hundreds of such Cosmic Tempestuous Battles had occurred."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But in the end, Empress Kira led the Bug Clan to defeat all other races, becoming the first true Master of the cosmos. The battle in which she successfully ruled the cosmos was called the Cosmic Ultimatum Battle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hundreds of Cosmic Tempestuous Battles and one Cosmic Ultimatum Battle shaped the general structure of the cosmos. The scene you saw is likely part of a battle from one of those Cosmic Tempestuous Battles."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On this battlefield, the Bug Clan, Spirit Clan, Beast Clan, Plant Clan, as well as Silicon-based Lifeforms and Singular Lifeforms, all took part in the fight. They battled each other relentlessly, with no end until death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial took a deep breath and continued, "This is an Ancient Battlefield. I don't know why, but the battles that once took place on this Ancient Battlefield keep looping and reappearing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned and said, "Ancient Battlefield? Cosmic Tempestuous Battle? What can I do now? I seem to be at the center of the Ancient Battlefield. I'm surrounded by terrifying battles. There's no way for me to leave here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I get caught in these looping battles, with my strength, I fear I'll be torn apart easily. Besides, I can't see any resources or treasures here that could enhance my power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering the Eighth Skyfall Casket, he, Adriana, Clara, and the others were transported to different places, and the location he was sent to was truly terrible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Around Osborne was not only a wasteland with no resources or treasures but also countless terrifying warriors' projections endlessly engaged in dreadful battles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't even leave this place!</span></p></div>
