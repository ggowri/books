        <h1>Chapter 32 Wesley’s Madness</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley glared at Osborne, desperately trying to devise a plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He needed to spend at least 60 million dollars to surpass Osborne and win the bet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though 60 million dollars was no small sum for him, it wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue if the auction had something worthwhile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But with the auction nearing its end, the remaining items didn&rsquo;t interest him. Spending 60 million dollars on useless items would undoubtedly result in punishment from The Wise Order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What should I do?</span> he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Losing the bet was not an option.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the heir to the prestigious Ashford family, submitting to Osborne was unthinkable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Regret for making a bet with Osborne began to seep in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sure, he could refuse to honor the bet, but with so many influential people witnessing, his and the Ashford family&rsquo;s reputation would be tarnished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Reputation was crucial in business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As an heir, he could afford to be flamboyant, wasteful, and arrogant, but he could not afford to gamble with his family&rsquo;s honor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, he had to win if he didn&rsquo;t want to lose the bet and didn&rsquo;t want to submit to Osborne. &ldquo;I absolutely can&rsquo;t lose. I represent the Ashford family.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley looked like he had gone mad. &ldquo;Even if The Wise Order reprimands me later, I cannot lose this bet. Osborne is out of money. I can win this.&rdquo; His eyes were full of determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered as he saw the crazed look in Wesley&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley had taken the bait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the auction was wrapping up, a last-minute addition was presented on the stage by Draco Auction House.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a Draco Model H mini-handgun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The auctioneer introduced it. &ldquo;This mini-handgun is a very special firearm. It boasts the fastest muzzle velocity, and it is compact and stylish. It was designed and manufactured by the Draco Group, and only one batch was ever produced, making it extremely rare and highly collectible.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The introduction piqued the interest of the major figures in the audience from Mayby City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Rosmandi, death, guns, and the Draco Group were three unavoidable things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone present had heard of the mini-handgun, renowned for its compact design, rapid firing speed, high precision, large magazine capacity, and low noise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, the Draco Group had never sold them publicly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The few that existed, no more than a hundred, were prized possessions of the elite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the underground market, one Model H mini-handgun could fetch over ten million dollars, yet they were rarely available even at that price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Wesley saw the pistol, his eyes lit up. His grandfather was an avid gun enthusiast and collector, and this pistol was something he had long desired but never obtained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was overjoyed. He had once offered a million dollars on the underground market to buy one Model H mini-handgun as a gift for his grandfather but had yet to obtain one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, he could purchase the pistol to present as a birthday gift, win the bet against Osborne, and make Osborne submit to him. It was a victory for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The heavens are truly on my side.&rdquo; Wesley laughed, looking at Osborne disdainfully. &ldquo;You useless fool, did you think you had won the bet? Watch and learn what it means to be from a prestigious family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m claiming this Model H mini-handgun. Get ready to submit to me.&rdquo; He then burst out laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was ecstatic, and all the frustration he had felt throughout the evening disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s expression flickered, guessing what Wesley intended, but she remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked at Wesley and scoffed, &ldquo;What are you so proud of? I&rsquo;ve already spent 60 million dollars. This is the final auction item. Do you think you can outspend me? You&rsquo;ll be the one submitting. I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re foolish enough to blow 60 million dollars on a single pistol.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley sneered, &ldquo;You worthless fool, don&rsquo;t think you can get at me with your words. This isn&rsquo;t just some ordinary gun. I&rsquo;ll show you the vast difference between us right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What seems impossible to you is merely routine for me. Your shallow understanding means you can&rsquo;t even begin to comprehend how much stronger I am as an heir to a prestigious family.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Wesley turned his attention back to the auction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The bidding for the Model H mini-handgun had already neared ten million dollars, with many influential figures still competing, clearly eager to add it to their collections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Wesley wasn&rsquo;t worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was the final auction item, and he needed to spend over 60 million dollars on it to win the bet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Spending less would mean losing the bet. And who could challenge him at that price?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although he would lose a lot of money, maintaining his pride, upholding the Ashford family&rsquo;s honor, and forcing Osborne to submit to him made it worth the expense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This evening had been full of frustration for him, being repeatedly humiliated and mocked by Osborne, whom he saw as a mere nobody.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had been itching to turn the tables, and now the opportunity had arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The bidding for the gun soon escalated to 15 million dollars, driven by the enthusiastic participation of several influential figures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, the room fell silent as the bidding stalled at 15 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley seized the moment. He raised his paddle high and shouted, &ldquo;Sixty million and one hundred thousand dollars!&rdquo;</p></div>
