        <h1>Chapter 1887 Lectured</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor stormed back, his anger simmering just beneath the surface. Though he had managed to rescue Kurt, the cost had been steep, ten pieces of Ultimate Luminous Armor and three Ultimate divine artifacts related to lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The loss gnawed at him, and he couldn't help but think, "If I had known this would happen, I should have just let Theodore kill Kurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't given up so many precious Ultimate divine artifacts out of love for his son or because he thought Kurt was worth that much. No, it was all about control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been confident he could take down Osborne and retrieve everything he'd lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the reality of the situation left him seething.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least he had confirmed the connection between the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings and the Hudson family. Once he passed that information to the Paramount Supreme Clan, they would undoubtedly take care of the Seven Young Deity Kings and the Hudson family themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon returning to the Baxter family's residence, Trevor retrieved the Binding Twin Pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This particular pearl wasn't bound to Kurt; it was tied to someone far more important&mdash;his other son, Neil Baxter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil was currently in the Central Zone with the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a simple activation of the Binding Twin Pearl, Trevor could instantly vanish from the Baxter family's residence and reappear in the Paramount Supreme Clan's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he completed his business there, he could activate the pearl again and return without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was how the Baxter family had always operated&mdash;silently colluding with the Paramount Supreme Clan, passing along information without anyone being the wiser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Alright, time to pay a visit to the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've issued a bounty on the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can get this information to them, I'll be in line for a reward that could even make up for some of my losses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Trevor activated the Binding Twin Pearl, his body disappearing in an instant, reappearing far away within the Paramount Supreme Clan's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Zachary and the others had returned to the Hudson family's estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Activate the divine power shield at full capacity! Don't worry about burning through the Essence Crystals! For the foreseeable future, everyone needs to stay on high alert. Anyone who dares to approach the estate will be dealt with on the spot!" Zachary ordered coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dispersing the group, Zachary, Alicia, and the others quickly made their way to Osborne's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they arrived, Osborne was already back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his uncles and aunts storm in with fierce expressions, he couldn't help but let out a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could say a word, Osborne said, "Aunties and uncles, I know I messed up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was too impulsive and overconfident! I didn't expect Trevor to have a Universe-Sealing Formation, which almost left me trapped. Thank you all for coming to my rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise I won't act so rashly again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he spoke, much of the anger on their faces faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's good that you realize your mistake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I warned you before&mdash;Trevor is a Supernal Deity King. You can't even begin to fathom the extent of his abilities. Have you learned your lesson now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness you left a Spatial Clone here. That way, we received your message in time to come and save you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, trapped in that Universe-Sealing Formation, you wouldn't have been able to send out a signal, and by the time we found out, it might have been too late!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's eyes reflected his own lingering fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alicia chimed in, "Exactly! Osborne, you were playing with fire! When Trevor went after you, Nadia and I nearly had heart attacks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia nodded vigorously. "Right? You can't be so reckless next time! You have to listen to us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, listen to them!" the group of uncles and aunts chimed in, taking turns to lecture Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dared not argue, simply nodding along, promising to be more cautious in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a lengthy session of admonitions, they finally ceased their lectures, satisfied with Osborne's attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, their expressions remained grave, the weight of the situation still heavy in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, your identity might have been compromised! The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are at risk of exposure, too! Trevor has already figured out that you're hiding here. If the Paramount Supreme Clan gets wind of this, given their arrogance and their hatred for you, they'll likely find a way to deal with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the time being, you need to stay put. As long as you're within our territory, it won't be easy for the Paramount Supreme Clan to come after you," Zachary said, his expression still tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow. He wasn't particularly concerned about his identity being revealed or the Paramount Supreme Clan knowing their location. After all, his initial plan was to leverage the reputation of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings to build a power base in Apocalypse City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If their identities and whereabouts were exposed, so be it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't want to jeopardize the Hudson family because of his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Zachary, I can't stay here! I'd only put you all in danger. I'm planning to leave and take care of a few things outside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Trevor had made Osborne acutely aware of his own lack of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to boost his power quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he needed most right now was the Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne decided to set off immediately for the divine peaks of Celestara, hoping to gather as many Miracle Elixirs as he could.</span></p></div>
