        <h1>Chapter 1610 The Escort Team</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire base at Divine Peak Nine was shielded by a massive divine power barrier, allowing exit only through four gates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the eastern gate was the closest to Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne arrived at the eastern gate, he found a crowd already gathered. These were individuals who had received assignments to leave the base for their respective missions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His own team members had also been assigned tasks, but none were heading to the Level Five mining area. Most were assigned to the Level One or Level Two mining zones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each team typically consisted of at least ten members, working together on their missions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Osborne, a chiliarch, was tasked with going to the Level Five area alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the location provided by his wrist terminal, Osborne made his way to the assembly point, where he noticed several people waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center stood a striking young man and woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was beautiful, and the man was handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recognized them as his charges: Diana and Emmett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was a member of the Human Community, currently at the late stage of Celestial Deity, possessing early Level Six earth elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the miners, her elemental essence ranked among the highest, which was why she was assigned to the Level Five mining area, which was known for its abundance of Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett, standing beside her, belonged to the Soaring Lion Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Figures, another member of the Huntington family!" Osborne thought, narrowing his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett hailed from the same clan as Athena and was a peak Celestial Deity, wielding powerful Level Five earth elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While his strength surpassed Diana's, his elemental essence was not as potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Athena must want me to protect Emmett, perhaps to have him keep an eye on me? Look at how everyone is flocking around him!" Osborne couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounding Emmett and Diana were a dozen individuals, most of whom were vying for Emmett's attention, wearing expressions of flattery and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite many being peak Celestial Deities themselves, and even one being a Deity Overlord warrior, they all treated Emmett with deference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne understood that he would be working alongside these elite individuals to protect Emmett and Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were heading to the Level Five mining area, where anyone lacking sufficient strength would meet a grim fate if they encountered the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the weakest among these individuals were at the peak of the Celestial Deity realm; at the very least, they were </span><span>chiliarchs</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the strongest, there was a Deity Overlord at the early stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne quietly observed the group, he realized that the time to gather and set off was drawing near.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly approached them, and immediately, all eyes turned to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're the last escort? You're Osborne?" the Deity Overlord warrior said, scrutinizing Osborne's identification badge with a furrowed brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait. You're only at the early stage of Celestial Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would someone at the early stage of Celestial Deity join our escort team? We require at least peak Celestial Deity strength to participate! Going to the Level Five mining area at your level is just asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the Deity Overlord finished speaking, the others looked at Osborne with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Diana regarded him with interest. When she realized he was also from the Human Community, her eyes lit up briefly before dimming again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed the reactions of everyone around him and replied coolly, "I'm not sure why I was assigned to your escort team, but that's how it is! If you think I'm not strong enough to go to the Level Five mining area, feel free to report it and get me kicked out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left everyone looking baffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like this guy has ruffled some feathers." They silently exchanged glances, their minds racing with speculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett then spoke up with a smile, "There's no need to kick him out! He joined our escort by my aunt's orders! Sure, he's at the early stage of Celestial Deity, but his strength is impressive&mdash;most of you wouldn't stand a chance against him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's more than capable of protecting both me and Diana in the Level Five mining area."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a menacing glint flashed in Emmett's eyes, a smirk appearing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others stared at Osborne, astonished. A Celestial Deity at the early stage surpassing their peak Celestial Deities? That was hard to wrap their heads around, especially coming from a Human Community member!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett's words stirred discontent among the group, their faces tightening with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none dared to challenge Emmett directly. Instead, they shot Osborne scornful glares, their eyes full of provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Is he that strong? An early-stage Celestial Deity stronger than a peak Celestial Deity? I doubt even the top talents of the other clans could pull that off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope he truly is that formidable! We can't afford to have him dragging us down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne maintained his calm demeanor, pretending he hadn't heard their criticisms as he stood aside, waiting for their departure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, two more individuals approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their aura radiated strength&mdash;one was a Deity Overlord at the early stage, while the other was even more impressive, boasting mid-stage Deity Overlord power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, the latter was the leader of this escort team, and everyone immediately bowed to him in respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was Riley Raglan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was from the Soaring Lion Clan.</span></p></div>
