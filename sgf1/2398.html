        <h1>Chapter 2315 Interfere</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy's expression darkened. "Jared, cut the guilt-tripping! I'm from the Azure Haven Academy, but that doesn't make you my boss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want my points, you'll have to fight me for them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if you can't make it into the top ten, don't try to blame me. You're the one who can't make it despite having the best-paid teammates. That just makes you a loser!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared's face paled at the barb. "Leroy, you're asking for trouble! How dare you defy the academy elders' orders? Remember, the Azure Haven Academy expects you to support me whole-heartedly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Clara interjected, her voice dripping with contempt, "Jared, you're incredibly shameless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy left your team on the first day. You treated her like dirt just because she spent some time looking for Osborne and couldn't hand in enough tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's been on my team for ages, and you still have the nerve to talk like that. How can you be so brazen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy scoffed in agreement. "Exactly! I quit your team right at the start. So, stop your bluster. It just makes me despise you more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Jared was seething. "Fine, fine, fine! Leroy, Clara, you've made your bed. I was being generous, giving you a chance to surrender. Since you won't take it, don't blame me for getting rough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I accidentally hurt you, don't come whining later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint flashed in his eyes as he roared, "No more holding back! From now on, Leroy is the enemy. Beat her down hard. If they keep resisting, go for the kill and disable them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jared launched a full-force attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His squad members exchanged steely glances and unleashed their full might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy and Clara were immediately overwhelmed. One brandished her Inferno Drake Lance while the other controlled her quasi-Sacred Artifact chains, barely fending off the onslaught. Trapped, they had no means to break free or retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed they were headed for certain defeat as the situation grew ever more dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne finally connected the dots, his face registering surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Leroy left the team to find me? Why would she do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could it be because I was gone for so long? Did she fear something bad had befallen me, so she risked going to the sixth layer to look for me, falling behind on token collection and getting kicked out by Jared?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne guessed the likely cause, a wave of guilt washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Leroy's search was out of a sense of gratitude, yet the fact remained that she'd left her team because of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And judging from Jared's words, Leroy might face punishment from the Azure Haven Academy after the state duel, paying a heavy price for her actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Punish Leroy? Over my dead body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Eight Great Academies are obsessed with cracking the top ten. They threw their weight behind Jared to make it happen, right? Well, I'll get Leroy there myself. No one in the Eight Great Academies will dare touch her then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">First things first, though. Gotta sort out this mess. Leroy and Clara are about to be toast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steel in his gaze, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy was currently locked in a desperate battle with Jared, who, as the twenty-eighth ranked powerhouse, wielded two fully mastered Sacred Artifacts&mdash;one for tearing opponents apart, the other for keeping himself safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her recent surge in power and complete mastery over the Inferno Drake Lance, Leroy was still outgunned. She was losing ground, her face paling with each parry, her hands shaking as she struggled to maintain her grip on the Lance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was on the ropes, about to go down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared taunted, "Leroy, face it. You're outmatched."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jared went nuclear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy found herself staring down the barrel of a terrifying attack, her eyes widening in stark realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she couldn't weather this storm; she was about to get wrecked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara, caught in her own brawl nearby, was beside herself with worry. She was desperate to bail Leroy out, but she was already fighting tooth and nail just to stay alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Leroy braced for impact, the unmistakable twang of a bowstring sliced through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy knew that sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A split second later, a Sacred Power arrow, crackling with energy, blazed past Leroy, nailing Jared's attack dead-center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the impact was cataclysmic, obliterating Jared's assault instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power arrow, showing no signs of slowing, continued its flight straight toward Jared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared's face contorted in disbelief. He threw everything he had into blocking the arrow, channeling every ounce of his Sacred Power, but it was like spitting into the wind. Finally, he was forced to call upon the might of his defensive Sacred Artifact just to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the sheer might of the Sacred Power arrow pierced through his defenses. Jared's face paled, and a trickle of blood oozed from the corner of his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury blazed in his eyes as he glared past Leroy. "Who the hell is it?! Who's got the guts to sneak-attack me?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy was floored, too. Just when she was about to take a serious hit, a familiar Sacred Power arrow had swooped in, not only saving her bacon but also hurting Jared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne's Sacred Power arrow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy spun around, a beaming smile lighting up her face when she spotted Osborne in the distance, clutching the Bloodwrought Bow. "Osborne, you're back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was just as gobsmacked. For a moment, she forgot all about her attackers as she gawked at Osborne in excitement. "Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy shouted in urgency, "Look out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Clara shouted, her opponents didn't miss a beat. Seizing the opening, they unleashed a relentless onslaught, quickly breaking through Clara's iron-chain defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had already nimbly drawn back the Bloodwrought Bow. Now a full-fledged Sacred Artifact, the bow could whip up Sacred Power arrows at lightning speed and with even more punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, three Sacred Power arrows zipped out, reaching Clara in a flash and knocking out all the attacks aimed at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without losing a step, they barreled towards the attackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eardrum-piercing screams filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attackers around Clara weren't in Jared's league, and they didn't have the protection of a defensive Sacred Artifact. Osborne's Sacred Power arrows sliced through their defenses like a hot knife through butter, leaving them seriously wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne had wanted them dead, they'd be pushing up daisies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, it was scary as hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single volley of three Sacred Power arrows, Osborne had critically injured three of them. Jared's eyes widened in disbelief, his face etched with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was well aware that his seven teammates were among the most powerful disciples in the Eight Great Academies. While not all were ranked in the top hundred, they were all formidable experts within the top two hundred, each capable of holding their own in a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here, Osborne had managed to wound three of them at once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at his injured teammates, Jared knew they were out of the fight for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face contorted with rage as he stared daggers at Osborne. "Osborne, you son of a bitch! How dare you harm my teammates?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're gonna pay for this!"</span></p></div>
