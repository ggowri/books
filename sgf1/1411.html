        <h1>Chapter 1410 Killing Began</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rocks in the mine were as hard as nails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why miners like Harry, armed with their specialized digging tools, could only advance a few feet each day. Even when a battle raged between Superior Deities, it barely made a dent in the mine's structural integrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was different; he wielded earth elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how solid the rock, Osborne had mastery over the very elements that composed it. Bringing the entire tunnel down wasn't exactly a walk in the park, but it was well within his capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was precisely what he set out to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden rumble, the mine trembled under the force of Osborne's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Lachlan and his subordinates could fully process what was happening, the walls of the mine caved in around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Massive boulders crashed down, swiftly blocking their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's expression shifted to one of alarm as he furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Swift, we've got a situation! Both the front and back passages have collapsed! We're trapped!" a subordinate shouted, panic evident in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's eyes widened. "What? How did this happen? Is this a trap set by Harry and Amelia? Did they know we were closing in and just blow the place up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan grimaced. "Desperate moves indeed! But do they truly think this will make me back off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a laugh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rocks may be tough, but to someone like me, a Transcendent Deity, they are hardly a challenge! I'll have this blockage cleared out in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the air around him crackled as his divine power surged dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive rocks that barred their way fractured under the onslaught of his might, crumbling into smaller pieces as the tunnel began to open up again at a rapid pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne, hidden in the shadows, couldn't help but feel a flash of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's some potent divine power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This human leader is no joke. With my current strength, I might not even be able to take him on. Better to deal with his subordinates first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, Osborne targeted the four Superior Deities at the front of Lachlan's group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were already disoriented by the sudden collapse of the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Why did the tunnel suddenly cave in? Looks like Harry and Amelia are still in this fight. We need to move fast and clear this mess. We can't let them slip away!" one of the men growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They hold the key to this secret mine. They've got to be packed with Essence Crystals&mdash;maybe even mid-grade ones! We have to catch Harry and Amelia before that lowly human Lachlan gets involved. If we do that, all the Essence Crystals will be ours. I sure as hell don't want to share them with Lachlan, that pathetic human."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their plan in mind, the four sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They unleashed their divine power, hammering against the debris that blocked their escape, but unfortunately, they were no match for Lachlan's might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panicked and desperate not to be caught by him, they pushed harder, channeling even more of their energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the chaos, none of them noticed a shadow emerging quietly behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne concealed his power signature with the Eclipsing Mantra, moving with zero energy fluctuation. The four Dark Deities were busy blasting through the obstructing rocks, unaware that someone was behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the moment, Osborne struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gripped the Goddess of Grain's scythe and swiftly slashed the neck of the last man in line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the man's head flew high, Osborne was already lunging at the next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the second man's head joined the first in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Restored to the Intermediate Deity level, Osborne's strength rivaled even some Transcendent Deities, far surpassing any Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Completely off guard and without divine power shields, these men's Divine Bodies stood no chance against the deadly scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne dispatched two with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining two finally sensed the danger, turning to see Osborne butchering their comrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic and divine power surged to shield their Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you appear here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their shouts, Osborne remained undeterred and struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash erupted in the narrow mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though prepared, the two Superior Deities quickly realized they were outmatched. Osborne's strength, defenses, and techniques all surpassed theirs, allowing him to easily subdue two at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scythe in Osborne's hands made swift work of their defenses, leaving them heavily wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! You filthy human, you can't kill us! We're official members of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion! Kill us, and you're finished!"</span></p></div>
