        <h1>Chapter 329 Beautiful Woman</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep inside the cave, chaos reigned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne guessed, the four pirates that escaped back were the leaders of the pirate organization called Hydrophis Belcheri Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hydrophis belcheri was said to be the most venomous sea snake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The poison would kill people at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the four, one was a middle-aged man in his forties with a big beard, Xavier Wilson. He was the leader of the Hydrophis Belcheri Organization, and the other three were deputy leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of them were also the only four people with special power in the Hydrophis Belcheri Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They launched a near full-scale attack on the Alisa Ship, with almost all of their forces mobilized. With only about 20 people left behind to guard the base, the rest set sail. They believed that if they succeeded this time, they would be able to enjoy their freedom for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the result was a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The electromagnetic energy cannon attack that dropped from the sky killed almost all of their men in an instant. If their leader had not been a water elemental metahuman who rolled up the sea water to block the electromagnetic energy above their heads, the four of them would have been crippled if not killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation of being struck by electromagnetic energy, causing their cells to boil, was still haunting them. Even now, just the thought of it filled them with overwhelming terror. They hastily retreated, feeling as if they had crawled back from hell itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't suppress the fear in their hearts and urgently needed to vent it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women they abducted were the best targets for venting their anger. The three deputy leaders rushed towards the group of women at the first opportunity. The more the women struggled, the more excited they became. They beat and humiliated them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only in this process could they relax and suppress the fear in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Xavier was not in a hurry to vent his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because all of his over one hundred subordinates had perished this time, the Hydrophis Belcheri Organization was practically disbanded. It would take an unknown amount of time for them to recover their strength, if they could recover at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made him terrified and extremely angry at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, how did they find us? We've done this several times before, hit and run, and we've never failed. How did they get found this time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, the loss is too great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier became angrier and angrier as he thought about it. At this moment, he heard the three deputy leaders venting their anger on women. The women screamed shrilly, which made him even more annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier felt that he also needed to vent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he immediately looked at the beautiful woman who was locked in a cage alone in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This beautiful woman had been personally abducted by Xavier not long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman was too beautiful and elegant, making him reluctant to use force on her. Xavier believed that engaging in such acts with a woman like her would be a waste if he couldn't have her cooperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he was very patient with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier began to pursue the woman, hoping that she could become his wife and run the Hydrophis Belcheri Organization with him, and develop it into the world's largest pirate organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she rejected him without hesitation and spat at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman also threatened Xavier that he had better release her immediately because she came from a very powerful force, and if she was not released, all the people of the Hydrophis Belcheri Organization would die miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could Xavier believe her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued to maintain patience, spending hours talking to the woman every day, hoping to change her mind and convince her to become his companion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the woman never responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If nothing unexpected happens, Xavier would remain patient with her and prepare to slowly influence her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was not prepared to wait any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier approached the iron cage where the woman was held captive, opened the cage door, and forcefully grabbed her delicate wrist, pulling her out of the cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, I'm going to play with you today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have lost my patience with you, you shameless woman. Today I will let you know how powerful I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying this, Xavier laughed loudly and began to tear her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's clothing was incredibly luxurious, completely different from the attire of the other imprisoned women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Xavier go crazy, she was immediately horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go! Let me go right now! If you dare to touch a hair of mine, you'll be dead! My brother won't let you go, and you'll die miserably!" The woman screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier laughed, saying, "Bitch, are you still threatening me with your brother? Then, tell me, who is your brother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a look of struggle on the woman's pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed reluctant to reveal her brother's identity, but now, as she was about to be subjected to Xavier's abuse, she could no longer bear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman shouted loudly, "My brother is Bryce Clarkson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finished speaking, and the surroundings suddenly became extremely quiet. Xavier </span><span>stopped tearing, and even the three deputy leaders who were exercising vigorously stopped their movements temporarily and looked at the woman fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The name "Bryce" seemed to hold a mysterious power over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Xavier burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is your brother Bryce?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you say your brother is Bryce, the leader of the largest pirate organization in the South Ocean of Rosmandi? He is the leader of the Likreia Mountain and known to have 8,000 elite pirates and can even challenge the Rosmandi fleet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he the Bryce with the codename 'Madman'?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, why don't you say you are the sister of the commander-in-chief of the Rosmandi fleet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dare you use Bryce to scare me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, Xavier viciously pounced on the woman.</span></p></div>
