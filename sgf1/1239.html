        <h1>Chapter 1238 The Fall of the Divine Family?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not going to watch?" Osborne raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle between the Deschanel family and the League of Divine Descent was just heating up, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he could sense the weight of concern from his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Byrd family had already had six members who reached godhood, yet they had barely held their ground against the onslaught from the Deschanel family. In the blink of an eye, their kin were decimated, and those six Junior Deities were captured without a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unnerving to think that the Deschanel family had split its forces into twelve, simultaneously attacking twelve different fronts within the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even one of the top ten families in the League couldn't withstand the tide, let alone the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian and the others felt the pressure mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't want to find themselves in the Byrd family's shoes, utterly powerless against an enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they were curious about the unfolding drama and the ultimate outcome of the war between the Deschanel family and the League, they knew they had to push their curiosity aside to focus on their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for what was happening outside, they weren't worried at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne handling things, they had complete confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied with a nod. "Alright. You all focus on your training; I've got the outside covered!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they returned to the Augustine Bastion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, each of them slipped away to their own training chambers. Even Anastasia and Zoe departed, eager to start their own journeys toward ascension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alone now, Osborne made his way back to Ransford, where the chaos had settled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Joseph and his group hadn't budged. They were still there, ready to interrogate the six captured members of the Byrd family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lot claim to be a Divine Family, right? Surely you have some ancestors from the Age of Gods still kicking around. Spill the beans&mdash;where are they hiding? I can make your suffering a little easier if you cooperate," Joseph said coldly, fixing his glare on the six Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ambitions extended beyond simply wiping out the League of Divine Descent; he wanted to hunt down every last one of those ancient gods from the thirty-six Divine Families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six Byrd family members glared back at him with fury, fully aware of his intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woody, the leader, spat defiantly at Joseph, anger rolling off him like steam from a boiling kettle. "You can forget it! You think you'll find out where our ancestors are? Dream on! Even if you kill us, we won't say a word. We'd never betray our lineage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's expression turned gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you're not in a position to make demands. You think death is the worst fate? Sometimes it's just a release! I'll make sure you regret every moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he slammed his palm onto Woody's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhhh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a piercing, soul-wrenching scream shattered the silence, revealing Woody's unimaginable torment. His body convulsed violently, a Junior Deity reduced to a quivering mess, as the excruciating pain caused him to lose control, both urine and feces spewing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even in that moment of sheer terror, he held his silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's patience waned. In a fit of rage, he crushed Woody's skull with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning his gaze to the remaining five, he leaned in menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me what I want to know, or he..." Joseph gestured disdainfully toward Woody's broken body, adding, "He was just a warm-up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brutal session of torture, Joseph had to kill them as all five Byrd family warriors stubbornly refused to break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anger rose within him like a tidal wave, fueled by their unyielding defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph sneered, his disdain palpable. "Hmph! You think holding out will save you? I doubt you even have many ancestors left! The Deschanel Clan was among the top-ranking divine clans during the Age of Gods, and even with our Sanctuary Casket, we barely managed to keep a hundred of our kind alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How many of you can possibly still be around?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we wipe out every last one of you Divine Families, you'll never have another generation to ascend to godhood. You old-timers are no match for the Deschanel family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't waste any more time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move on to the next target! Today, we'll eradicate every last one of the thirty-six Divine Families of the League of Divine Descent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he motioned for his two companions to follow him as they swiftly departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their next destination lay in Easionand, home to a Divine Family that boasted even greater strength than the Byrd family. But Joseph was unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, even if some members of these Divine Families had managed to break through to godhood, their numbers would be limited&mdash;and they'd all be Junior Deities at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scoffed at the thought of any of them being a real threat. Even those gods who had survived since the Age of Gods would likely only have their strength restored to Intermediate Deity at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph thought, "Junior Deity? Intermediate Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Please! I could squash them like bugs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once we take down the League of Divine Descent, who could possibly stand against the Deschanel family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's confidence was palpable, but would reality unfold as he envisioned?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't share his optimism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that the League of Divine Descent wouldn't fall so easily to the Deschanel family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a determined flick of his wrist, Osborne began to absorb the surrounding blood energy, hesitating for a moment before following Joseph.</span></p></div>
