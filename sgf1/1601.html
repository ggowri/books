        <h1>Chapter 1600 Athena Backed Down</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words sent a ripple of shock through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't anticipated that he had secretly recorded the entire incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he foresee this situation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne handed a terminal to Athena, a smug smile appeared on his face. The crowd exchanged uneasy glances, their brows furrowing in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Athena remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the terminal Osborne had given her, she didn't even bother to glance at it. With a flicker of divine power, she crushed it into dust, letting the fragments slip away like grains of sand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept onto her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You recorded the events? Where is it? I don't see anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Osborne with a mocking glint in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle, thinking, "She's brazen! It's clear she's out for blood today, seeking revenge for Calvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with evidence in hand, she dares to destroy it in front of me and then questions where it is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bold move, very bold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed. "Ms. Athena Huntington, you're impressive! You didn't even need to open </span><span>the terminal to know... that I handed you the wrong one! The terminal with the evidence? Oh, it's still right here with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry about that mix-up," he said, pulling out another terminal and twirling it in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena's smile vanished, replaced by a scowl as she glared at Osborne, her fists clenching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she realized she had been outmaneuvered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had likely anticipated her destruction of the terminal and had given her a decoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury boiled within her. "Show me the evidence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "I think it's best if everyone sees the evidence together. Besides, I'm worried someone might twist the narrative, so I've already sent copies of the evidence to my friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I face any punishment over this, they will make it public! Of course, I know that even if it's made public, it won't save me. But I can't help but wonder if you have any rivals, Ms. Athena Huntington.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps some folks from the Demonic Dragon Clan or Mystic Feather Clan might find this evidence interesting?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you make a misstep, who knows how they might exploit it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your talent, becoming a major or even a general seems like a sure thing! But if a mistake costs you that chance, it would be a real shame..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze remained fixed on Athena, a glimmer of mischief in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena's expression darkened further, her glare at Osborne seething with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you threatening me? You're saying that if I dare to punish you, you'll hand the evidence over to the Demonic Dragon Clan and Mystic Feather Clan? Let them use it against me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was laced with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, "Ms. Athena Huntington, I didn't say that at all. I'm just reminding you to be cautious. Don't let a small matter lead you to make a mistake that could impact the bigger picture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm only looking out for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena's face darkened further, a palpable aura of murderous intent enveloping the entire Malevolence Airship&mdash;and Osborne as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne showed no fear, his smile unwavering and relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others around them fell silent, shock etched on their faces as they regarded Osborne. No one had expected that, with Athena clearly gunning for him, Osborne would not only remain unharmed but would also manage to gain the upper hand against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances, unsure of what to say, while Calvin's expression turned ashen, a bitter resentment boiling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that Athena would never dare to punish Osman; she wouldn't risk her future for the sake of revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden shift, Athena retracted her murderous intent, a cold smile creeping onto her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Osborne, is it? Impressive! I didn't expect to have someone like you under my command! Consider yourself noted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we reach Divine Peak Nine, I'll make sure to give you a chance to shine! You'd better keep up the good work and make a name for our sixth division there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After delivering her words, she cast a lingering glance at Osborne before turning on her heel to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take Calvin to my quarters. He's one of my </span><span>chiliarchs</span><span>, and I'll personally see to his treatment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Athena vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the evidence in Osborne's hand, she clearly had no interest in it; it simply wasn't important to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched her disappear, his expression growing colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured to himself, a wave of murderous intent washing over him, "Is she trying to threaten me? Is she suggesting that when we get to Divine Peak Nine, she'll shove me into the most dangerous situations to test me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounds like she wants to use me as cannon fodder, aiming to put me in harm's way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, Athena, let's see who ends this first&mdash;either you'll take me out, or I'll come for you!"</span></p></div>
