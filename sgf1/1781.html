        <h1>Chapter 1780 The First Battle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to Anastasia and the others, and his voice was steady and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is our first battle, and we need to win it spectacularly! We can't let them have their way with us in this eight-on-eight matchup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, how about you take the lead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can take down all eight of them on your own?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, a spark ignited in Anastasia's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excitement was palpable among the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce chuckled, "Letting Anastasia go one-on-eight? If she pulls that off, those guys will be left dumbfounded. It'll be like a slap in the face. I mean, I'd love to jump in and teach them a lesson myself, but this sounds way more entertaining."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement, and their anticipation grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no doubts about Anastasia's capabilities and saw no issues with Osborne's plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew too well what Anastasia was capable of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their recent skirmishes, even when they teamed up against her, they had struggled immensely. Winning against her had come at a steep cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, it was clear to them that Anastasia could definitely handle the eight of them alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A confident smile appeared on Anastasia's face as she replied, "I'm all in! Just tell me what to do, Osborne! I'm only worried that if I go out first, the rest of their teams might chicken out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "No worries! We just need to fight until they're too scared to continue. No need to beat them all into the ground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded and stepped forward, and her presence commanded attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side of the arena, Orson, Stellan, and the others frowned as they saw Anastasia approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers from various clans were equally puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orson scoffed, "What's going on? You're Vivienne, right? What are you guys playing at? We're already on the stage. Let's get this battle started! Are you trying to stall for time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia replied coldly, "Of course not! It's just that taking on all eight of you isn't necessary. I can handle this all by myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was calm, but the strength of her words resonated clearly with everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stunned silence fell over the crowd as they processed her audacious claim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Does she really think she can take on Orson and his team alone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does she consider these eight young talents from various clans beneath her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps erupted throughout the arena, and the expressions of many turned sour with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the most furious were Orson, Stellan, and their teammates, and their faces were flushed with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vivienne! You're an arrogant woman! What did you just say? Do you dare to underestimate us? Do you think you can take on all eight of us by yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for trouble!" Orson's voice boomed. The sky rumbled in response to his fury as lightning crackled around him, and his eyes were filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Anastasia remained unfazed, a calm smile gracing her lips as she watched the storm of energy swirling around Orson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether I'm asking for trouble or not, you'll find out soon enough! You can go ahead and make your move! Show me you're not just a bunch of weaklings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she waved her hand dismissively at Orson, and her expression dripped with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orson's eyes blazed with fury. "You're dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your own doing! I hope you don't regret it later. Once I kill you, I'll go after the rest of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this over with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Orson lunged into action. As a super genius from Thunderstorm Drake Clan, he was a master of controlling lightning and storms. He struck Anastasia with a powerful fist, sending a surge of thunder that seemed to usher in the apocalypse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill her!" Stellan, Lazarus, and the other seven warriors followed suit, unleashing their attacks without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Booms echoed as various strikes rained down on Anastasia, enveloping her in an instant. Her delicate frame seemed almost insignificant against the overwhelming onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anastasia, unfazed, merely smiled at the attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes locked onto Orson and his team as she murmured, "Osborne said this is our first battle, and we have to win beautifully to shock everyone. So, it's your unlucky day, you eight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you're all going down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Anastasia extended her slender right hand and punched Orson and his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch looked harmless at first, but within seconds, terrifying violet lightning gathered on her hand and exploded outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder roared, and lightning crackled as the entire arena was enveloped in a blinding storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orson and his teammates' attacks were shredded to pieces in the face of the overwhelming lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In sheer terror, the eight warriors were electrocuted.</span></p></div>
