        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly closed the Dimensional Bag, biting her lower lip as she looked at Osborne, her eyes filled with a complex expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha asked, "Osborne, these things are very important to me. I can't refuse them. But I owe you too much. Why are you so good to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne paused for a moment and said, "Why am I so good to you? Aren't we friends? Friends should help each other."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha bit her lower lip, thinking, "Friends? Are we just friends?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She recalled her past with Osborne. After her Dark Phoenix Bloodline was exposed, a group of warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection relentlessly hunted her. The warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan desperately protected her and chose to self-destruct for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she was about to be caught and killed by those people, Osborne suddenly appeared and saved her, then fled desperately with her. In the end, she escaped the pursuit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For her safety, Osborne gave her the precious Sublime Concealment Orb to help her hide her aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Osborne had given her so many valuable items, including even the branch of the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore, considered a treasure by the entire Ember Phoenix Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha felt she could never repay Osborne's kindness and grace towards her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&#38500;&#20102;&#29992;&#36523;&#20307;&#20607;&#36824;&#65292;&#22905;&#24819;&#19981;&#21040;&#21035;&#30340;&#26041;&#27861;&#20102;&#12290;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne said they were just friends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha felt a bit lost, somewhat disappointed, and sad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne had no idea what Agatha was thinking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After distributing the good stuff, he stored the rest in Satan Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, he was going to start building the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A regular Cosmic Translocator couldn't support their journey from here to the resource-bearing planet being mined by the Frenetic Storm Warband, as there was no Cosmic Translocator near that resource-bearing planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne could only build a One-way Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Luckily, I already learned how to build a Level One One-way Cosmic Translocator. Otherwise, I would have to use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I can now build a regular Level One Cosmic Translocator in one minute. However, a One-way Cosmic Translocator is more complex. So, I need at least three minutes to build a Level One One-way Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne began to act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they were in the starry sky, with no planets around. So, Osborne decided to build the Cosmic Translocator in the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked Angela to stop the Sacred Artifact battleship first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, what are you going to do?" Angela, now calm, looked at Osborne curiously after keeping his kindness in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hiding from her, Osborne prepared the materials while answering, "Using the Sacred Artifact battleship to reach that resource-bearing planet is too slow. So, I decided to build a Cosmic Translocator and teleport us there directly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words left Angela stunned. She said in disbelief, "What did you say? You want to build a Cosmic Translocator and teleport us there directly? Have you already learned how to build a Cosmic Translocator?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela widened her eyes, not believing his words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they first arrived at Stellar Region M72, Osborne knew nothing about the Cosmic Translocator, not even how to repair it. He had even asked her for guidance. Although she taught Osborne, she never believed he could learn to repair the Cosmic Translocator in such a short time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, Adriana transmitted all the information about building the Cosmic Translocator. Then, Angela handed the materials to Osborne for him to study.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Angela still felt it would be difficult for Osborne to learn how to build the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he could learn, Angela thought it would definitely take him a long time to grasp some of the knowledge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Not much time has passed, but Osborne actually claims he has mastered the method of building the Cosmic Translocator. Moreover, he seems to want to build one on his own."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How is that possible? In Fairy Moon Sect, no one can build a Cosmic Translocator alone. How could Osborne possibly do it?"</span></p></div>
