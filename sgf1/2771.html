        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If given the chance, Emperor Frederick would probably not hesitate to offer the 1.896 billion Sacred Artifacts in the Royal Treasury just to exchange for one Imperial Artifact, right?" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this was merely Osborne's guess.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Perhaps the Imperial Artifact itself isn't that valuable? Or maybe Emperor Frederick already possesses an Imperial Artifact but has never revealed it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this thought, Osborne's expression grew even more serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Treasury holds over ten thousand Supreme Sacred Artifacts, but he wasn't sure if the Royal Family possessed an Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Stellar Region M72, that demonic cultivator from Blossom Cage almost used the Bewitching Lantern to absorb the power of the Phantomagic Realm, transforming it into an Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Frederick's strength far surpasses that of the demonic cultivator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he likely already possesses an Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this thought, Osborne took a deep breath, his apprehension toward Frederick growing even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Emperor Frederick hiding the Imperial Artifact is most likely to use it at a critical moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I must also find a way to obtain an Imperial Artifact. Even if I can't use it for now, I can give it to Ms. Alba to use.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Ms. Alba has an Imperial Artifact, there would be no need to worry about Emperor Frederick anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even the most basic low-grade Imperial Artifact requires five billion battle points. I truly doubt whether I can manage it. Moreover, I also want to obtain some Perfect Dragon Elixir. With the Perfect Dragon Elixir, I might enter that unique Enlightenment State, step into the Chaotic World, and gain Primordial Energy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne realized that he needed to exchange for too many things, but his battle points were very limited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't sure if he could accumulate enough battle points, but he could only do his best to strive for it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Osborne asked Toby some questions and learned the prices of the items he needed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He discovered that Toby had almost everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But without exception, the prices were way beyond what he could afford right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne didn't make any exchanges. Three million three hundred thousand battle points couldn't get anything that could significantly enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he ended this exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The red glow around him quickly retreated into the Battle Points Monument.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara, Leroy, and Casey were still making exchanges.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina and the others had mostly finished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne reappeared, Seraphina sneered, "I didn't expect you to arrive so quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina was actually quite surprised. The reason she could reach the ninth floor so quickly was that the Royal Family had previously explored the Celestial Spire and was very familiar with the conditions of the first dozen floors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, just finding the trial locations on each floor would have consumed a lot of her time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What shocked her even more was the number of battle points displayed above Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>3,330,000!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This means Osborne received the highest reward in every trial on the first nine floors and always defeated the warriors' projections in one breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is no easy feat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the six princes and princesses, all reached Mid Empyrean Sacredness, but only three achieved the same battle points as Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other three earned fewer battle points than Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This shows that Osborne's strength has surpassed the three princes and princesses who reached Mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile, ignoring her. He noticed the battle points above Seraphina's head had reset to zero, clearly indicating she had completed the exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no idea what she exchanged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne didn't care about it. With his current strength, no matter what Seraphina exchanged, it couldn't pose a threat to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He patiently waited for Clara and the other two to complete their exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina snorted coldly when Osborne ignored her, "Osborne, are you really sure you won't join my team? Starting from the tenth level, the trials are completely different! They're harder, but allow team cooperation!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Join our team, and you'll pass more trials and earn more Battle Points. Otherwise, with just the four of you, it will be tough to gain many Battle Points, let alone reach the eighteenth level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne responded calmly, "If you follow my orders, I might consider joining you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina immediately retorted angrily, "Dream on! Me follow your orders? Do you think that's possible? I'm the strongest, and I know the Celestial Spire best. Of course, I should lead the team!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "Then there's nothing more to discuss!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina snorted coldly and said no more. "Let's go! We'll continue to the tenth level. Starting from the tenth level, we can work as a team. With fifty-six of us, clearing it will be a breeze, all the way to the eighteenth level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, everyone will earn a lot of Battle Points. As for certain people, I hope they won't regret it or come begging me to let them join the team!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina led the group up the stairs to the tenth level and disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Clara, Leroy, and Casey all completed the exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The difference is that Clara, like Leroy and Osborne, still had 3.33 million Battle Points displayed above their heads, clearly not having made any exchanges.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They probably realized these Battle Points weren't enough to exchange for something that could enhance their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey's Battle Points, however, had all been exchanged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Let's go, let's enter the tenth level too. The test on the tenth level allows teamwork. It should be easier for us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished speaking, and Casey's eyes immediately lit up. "Really? Teamwork is allowed? Then I can rely on your strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and didn't respond.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the four arrived at the tenth level of Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye to search for Seraphina and the others, then quietly followed behind them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, it took a full half hour before Seraphina and the others finally found the testing site on the tenth level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An even larger beam of light descended.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Seraphina led everyone into the beam of light, and instantly, a group of powerful Beast Projections appeared opposite them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were tigers, lions, dragons, and more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, they were various beast creatures, massive in size, with auras reaching Primary Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One hundred Primary Empyrean Sacredness Beast Projections?" Osborne murmured softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The difficulty of the tenth level's trial suddenly jumped several tiers compared to the ninth. The ninth level had only one Primary Empyrean Sacredness warrior's projection, but the tenth level had a full hundred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, teamwork is allowed here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at the Battle Points Monument and saw the words on it had changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Passing the level rewards each person with 100,000 Battle Points."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing within a hundred breaths rewards each person with 1,000,000 Battle Points."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing within fifty breaths rewards each person with 2,000,000 Battle Points."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing within twenty breaths rewards each person with 5,000,000 Battle Points."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing within ten breaths rewards each person with 10,000,000 Battle Points."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne saw the situation on the Battle Points Monument and couldn't help but be a bit surprised. "The rewards have increased tenfold again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the time limit for earning the highest reward has been extended tenfold."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Previously, to get the highest reward, you had to clear it within one breath. But now, as long as you clear it within ten breaths, you can get the highest reward!"</span></p></div>
