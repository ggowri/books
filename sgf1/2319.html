        <h1>Chapter 2265 Reveled in the Turmoil-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's face paled in an instant as a surge of power washed over him. He whipped his blazing spear around once more, desperately trying to fend off Osborne's relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to counterattack, Osborne let out a cold laugh and released his hold on the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, three Sacred Power arrows shot out in rapid succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrows pierced through Tyson's defenses like they were made of paper, sending his fiery spear flying through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact hit him like a freight train, knocking him off-balance and sending him staggering backward. The arrows tore through his shoulder, and with a final force, he was launched off the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson crashed to the ground, utterly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne lowered his bow and looked at Tyson's battered body with a smug smile. "Good work! You put on a pretty good show, though it was a bit too flashy. I'd give you 99 out of 100, but I had to take a point off to keep you from getting too full of yourself! Don't forget to come to me for your payment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There </span><span>isn</span><span>'t no one in this world who can't be swayed. It's always just a matter of the right price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a chuckle and shook his head as he stepped off the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Down below, the crowd erupted into an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their voices clashed like the crashing waves against the shore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Osborne is so cocky! He actually tried to buy Tyson right in front of our eyes! And Tyson played along&mdash;he deliberately threw the match!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How many Sacred Crystals did he offer Tyson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two hundred thousand? Three hundred thousand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable! Tyson, the guy who always talked about integrity, just sold himself out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disgraceful! He's even more despicable than Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Referee! </span><span>It's</span><span> crystal clear they're rigging the match! Are you just going to stand there and do nothing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience was seething with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The majority were convinced that Tyson didn't lose because Osborne was more powerful, but because he'd been bribed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Tyson was the runner-up in the previous city duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how strong Osborne was, how could he take Tyson down with just several arrows?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It smelled fishy, like a well-orchestrated farce!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The referee boomed, his voice echoing throughout the arena, "Quiet! Everyone, settle down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll look into any claims of match-fixing. If it's found to be true, we'll invalidate the results! Alright, let the battle rage on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his declaration, the audience's anger subsided a bit, but their looks of disdain for Osborne remained. They stared daggers at him, hurling insults and scathing criticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, though, couldn't have cared less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he reveled in the turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Everyone thinks I bribed Clara, huh? Well, I'll play along! Let them believe I managed to beat Tyson by underhand means.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've got no reason to feel guilty. Let them yell their lungs out.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a few spectators were watching Osborne intently, their faces solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that Tyson hadn't lost because of a bribe; it was the overwhelming might of Osborne's Sacred Power arrows that had brought him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, that's a real force to be reckoned with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy's eyes were alight with excitement. Her fingers drummed lightly on the air, as if she was itching to step into the ring and take on Osborne herself. She could barely hold back her eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly, it wasn't their turn just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the tournament rolled on, Osborne faced no real challenges. He breezed through three consecutive victories with ease. By the end of the first day of the Top 16 matches, he remained undefeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the other competitors, only three of them were still on a perfect streak&mdash;Leroy, Marreese, and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience showed complete respect for Leroy and Marreese, acknowledging their strength as legitimate and well-earned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's undefeated record sparked anger and distrust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Total nonsense! He bought his victories! Look how he took down Tyson!" The grumbling grew louder, echoing doubts throughout the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet nothing anyone said could alter the outcomes already etched into memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second day of battles began swiftly.</span></p></div>
