        <h1>Chapter 810 Fierce Battle With Mose</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Light Realm!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash, Osborne turned into a mini sun, lighting up the area for hundreds of yards.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "There should be six assassins from the Eityreia Organization, but I only sense five. If I'm right, the missing one must be Mose. He must be using some kind of stealth. Someone as skilled as him could easily surprise me if I'm not careful. I need to stay alert."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, Osborne expanded the Light Realm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Within this area, any stealth Mose used would be revealed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure enough, as the light spread, Osborne quickly spotted Mose. He had quietly moved to Osborne's side, ready to attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne grunted and instantly shifted the light around him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose's attack was fast and strong. If Osborne hadn't detected him, he might have been caught off guard. But with the light bending around him, Mose's attack missed, barely grazing Osborne's side.Mose sneered, saying, "Light Realm, huh? It's not going to save you.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"All I need to do is break through your Light Realm, and you're done for!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Attack together!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his command, all five remaining Eityreia Organization assassins revealed themselves and launched a coordinated assault on Osborne's Light Realm. While they might not match Cuthbert's strength individually, their combined force was even more formidable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the Light Realm began to quake violently, as if it were about to shatter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression hardened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph! You all enjoy hunting others so much? Well, now it's your turn to experience being hunted!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the Dimensional Space, Osborne summoned the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The distorted light around him made it easy for him to appear behind one of the Eityreia Organization assassins. With a swift swing of the scythe, he cleanly decapitated the assassin.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Eityreia Organization's assassin was still fiercely attacking Osborne's Light Realm, completely oblivious to Osborne's stealthy approach. He was caught off guard by the fact that Osborne possessed the Goddess of Grain's scythe, a weapon so razor-sharp it could effortlessly slice through his defenses and decapitate him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The severed head soared through the air, its owner's eyes wide with confusion.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even in death, he was unaware of how he had been killed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The distortion in the light had concealed his death from the others.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne moved to the next assassin, striking from behind with the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once again, he effortlessly sliced through the defenses and took off the assassin's head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Light Realm trembled under the intense assault from Mose and the others.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It quaked more violently with each passing moment, soon unable to withstand the pressure and shattering into pieces.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before it collapsed completely, Osborne had already taken out four of the Eityreia Organization assassins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the Light Realm dissolved, Mose, who had been sneering, suddenly noticed the fallen bodies of his four comrades, their heads lying beside them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose's eyes widened in shock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is this possible? How did you manage this?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled coolly, "Oh, I just used the same methods you're so fond of. You think only you can be a killer? If you can assassinate others, then others can surely assassinate you.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And within my Light Realm, they were nothing more than prey. It's a pity the Light Realm has collapsed; otherwise, I would've liked to see if I could take you down too."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose's face turned an ominous shade of anger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're dead! Killing the assassins of the Eityreia Organization means your life is forfeit!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's no escape for you, no matter where you go!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Mose could finish his threat, he lunged forward again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His form vanished once more, and without the Light Realm, Osborne couldn't sense his position.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But without the Light Realm, Osborne still had other domains at his disposal.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thunder Realm!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Osborne activated the Thunder Realm. A sea of lightning surged out, covering a radius of hundreds of yards and revealing Mose's location almost immediately.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne charged straight for Mose.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose's expression hardened dramatically. "Impossible! You have not only a Spatial Domain and a Light Realm but also a Thunder Realm? Damn it! Even so, I'll shatter this domain in no time!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Furious, Mose unleashed a furious assault.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's Thunder Realm was still in its early stages, and under Mose's relentless attack, it was on the brink of collapsing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne was already closing in on Mose.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a cold gaze, Osborne declared, "A killer without stealth is like a fish out of water! Mose, you want to take my head? Let me take yours first?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Swinging the Goddess of Grain's scythe with deadly precision, Osborne struck at Mose.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose's eyes widened in sheer terror.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next heartbeat, a head was sent flying through the air.</p></div>
