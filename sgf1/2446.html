        <h1>Chapter 2356 Powerful Defense-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You really made a good choice," Primordial said speechlessly. "That shield is definitely the strongest among these four Sacred Artifacts. Even though it's restricted to the level of a low-grade Sacred Artifact, it's still harder to deal with than the other three. Do you think it's not challenging enough and want to make it harder for yourself?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he added, "I think you should challenge that battle blade."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne smiled and said, "I know that shield is the strongest, but I still want to challenge it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne stepped into the range of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne felt a wave of dizziness and found himself on the virtual arena. The projection of the Sacred Artifact-level shield was right in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a swallowtail-shaped shield. Slightly convex in the middle, narrower at the top and bottom, with a flat upper edge and a swallowtail-like lower edge. The front was engraved with the Warfare Ancient Tree, seemingly with black mist flowing within, exuding the exact same aura as the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shield was entirely black, but green light flickered across it. It wasn&rsquo;t large, clearly a one-handed shield, barely covering a third of Osborne's body, without giving off a bulky impression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll call you Warfare Shield," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He chose the Warfare Shield as his opponent for the trial after carefully considering all his circumstances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His greatest advantage is his strong attack power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to his attack power, his defense is average. Compared to Agatha with the Phoenix Skeletal Shield, his defense is quite poor. Especially when he can't use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, he can only rely on Sacred Power and his own body for defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When facing enemies, Osborne mostly relies on his powerful attack to directly defeat opponents, leaving no chance for them to test his defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the Sacred Artifacts on the Warfare Ancient Tree, the battleship is the most formidable, excelling in both offense and defense. The spear was chosen by Primordial, so it must be extraordinary, with undoubtedly strong attack power. The war sword is probably similar to the spear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne worries that his defense might not withstand the spear and the war sword. After all, he only has one chance for the trial. If he fails, things will get troublesome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Shield is a Defensive Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, its attack power is definitely not strong. Osborne doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about being defeated; all he needs to do is give his all to break through the Warfare Shield&rsquo;s defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he can break through the Warfare Shield's defense, he will win. Otherwise, he will lose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Warfare Shield will be suppressed to a low-grade Sacred Artifact. I don't believe I can't break its defense." Osborne stared at the Warfare </span><span>Shield,</span><span> his eyes full of fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the Warfare Ancient Tree said in his mind, "The trial begins."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the Warfare Shield began to unleash immense power. The phantom of the Warfare Ancient Tree on the shield suddenly focused, and a faint mist enveloped the Warfare Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the Warfare Mist?" Osborne was utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Warfare Shield can indeed release Warfare Mist like the Warfare Ancient Tree. However, the Warfare Mist released by the Warfare Shield is noticeably thinner compared to that of the Warfare Ancient Tree. So, its defense can't be that strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, Osborne could just admit defeat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he used the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and burned fifty thousand Sacred Crystals to break through the previous Warfare Mist. If relying solely on his own strength, it would have been impossible.</span></p></div>
