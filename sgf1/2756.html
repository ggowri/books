        <h1>Chapter 2619 Key-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For tens of thousands of years, many powerhouses who reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness had appeared on Racial Convergence Planet, but aside from the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet, no one else seemed to have broken through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the powerhouses of various major forces all looked toward the Celestial Spire and the nine Skyfall Caskets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they wanted to rush over immediately to open the Skyfall Caskets and obtain the opportunities and power within.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, don't rush."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick continued, "Don't rush. Now is not the time. Necropolis City may seem calm, but we still can't approach it. If we get close, we'll surely die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only when the Spirit-Entombing Roses bloom can Necropolis City be opened!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at Frederick in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are Spirit-Entombing Roses? There's nothing else here except for the nine Skyfall Monoliths, the nine Skyfall Caskets, and a Celestial Spire!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick smiled and said, "Don't worry! The Spirit-Entombing Roses will appear soon! Once they bloom, they'll release an extremely terrifying scent called Spirit-Entombing Fragrance. This scent targets soul power, and the higher one's cultivation level, the more it attracts the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance, resulting in stronger soul attacks!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Under normal circumstances, after the Spirit-Entombing Roses bloom, an incredibly intense Spirit-Entombing Fragrance will appear. This scent can easily annihilate all our souls, and we won't be able to resist it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, every thousand years, after the Spirit-Entombing Roses bloom, the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance is not intense but rather faint. We can survive in this faint Spirit-Entombing Fragrance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now is precisely the time when the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance is faint, occurring once every thousand years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying this, Frederick looked at the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana just asked me if those who have reached Empyrean Sacredness can enter the Celestial Spire. Let me tell you now. No! Because there is an extremely powerful Cultivation Shackle at the entrance of the Celestial Spire, and anyone beyond Empyrean Sacredness will be blocked outside!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter how they conceal their cultivation level aura, it&rsquo;s useless. No one who has reached Empyrean Sacredness can enter the Celestial Spire, including me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if we join forces, we cannot break the Cultivation Shackle of the Celestial Spire. So, only those who haven&rsquo;t reached Empyrean Sacredness can enter the Celestial Spire to face the challenges..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as any one of them can pass the eighteenth level of the Celestial Spire, that person will obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The eighteenth level?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone said, "How difficult is it? Do these juniors stand a chance?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Its difficulty is immense!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick calmly said, "They can obtain a Skyfall Casket key for every nine levels they pass in the Celestial Spire. Back then, the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet had extraordinary talent and strength, but they only obtained the key to the Ninth Skyfall Casket. In the end, they failed at the seventeenth level and couldn't reach the eighteenth, so they got the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, everyone looked very anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet even failed at the seventeenth level? Now we can only hope these juniors pass the eighteenth level to get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although their strength is decent, how can they compare to the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strong ones all frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick smiled and said, "Not necessarily! Before the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet entered the Ninth Skyfall Casket, their talent and strength weren't that remarkable. At least, they might not be stronger than these juniors..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I wasn't confident, I wouldn't have brought you here. In any case, I've been preparing for a long time to get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket. This time, we have a great chance of obtaining the key and opening the Eighth Skyfall Casket..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Frederick's eyes were filled with excitement, but he forcibly suppressed it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I assure everyone, once we open the Eighth Skyfall Casket, we can enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket together..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the Eighth Skyfall Casket, everyone just needs to rely on their own strength to pass the trials. All the treasures, opportunities, and even powers you obtain will entirely belong to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Frederick finished speaking, everyone's breathing grew heavier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked, "Can we also enter the Skyfall Casket?"</span></p></div>
