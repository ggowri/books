        <h1>Chapter 886 Unstoppable</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stood calmly with his foot planted firmly on Ebony's face, looking over at Marlon with a smirk.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've humiliated her. So what? What are you going to do about it?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the spectators fell silent, eyes wide with disbelief. They exchanged glances, shocked at the scene unfolding before them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could this happen?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How dare Osborne do this?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone had thought that after Marlon's threat, Osborne would restrain himself, at most defeating Ebony without seriously harming her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, Osborne not only injured Ebony but did so with brutal force, slapping her face and trampling her underfoot.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was Osborne really disregarding Marlon's warning entirely?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Marlon hadn't issued that threat, perhaps Osborne wouldn't have humiliated Ebony this way.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Curious glances turned to Marlon as the crowd awaited his response.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon's expression darkened, a terrifying fury emanating from him, twisting his handsome features into something almost monstrous, as if he could devour his foe whole.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He locked eyes with Osborne, then glanced down at his sister, who was helpless beneath Osborne's foot.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A low growl escaped his throat. "Osborne, you're dead!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, an overwhelming force exploded from Marlon's body, sending shockwaves through the crowd.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the Class S Supreme Overlords on the high platform couldn't hide their shock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whoa, he's strong!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gasps of astonishment filled the air as people felt the power radiating from Marlon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard Marlon has leveled up, maybe even breaking into the top twenty of the Godson Rankings, or even the top ten! I thought it was just talk, but maybe it's not!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absolutely, Marlon's got that kind of power!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's probably surpassed Cuthbert by a mile! He's the strongest among the younger generation!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Scarlett's face turned serious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feeling Marlon's power, she scoffed, saying, "So he's really this strong. No wonder he's so confident! But even so, I could take you down in the wild!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though she said it, her usual bravado had dimmed considerably.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon roared, his power surging around him like a storm, "Osborne, you're dead!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let my sister go, or I swear I'll kill you right here!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow, surprised by Marlon's strength.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet he remained unfazed. "Kill me? You think you can do that? And this is my Honor Quest Ceremony, not your playground!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jackie stood up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said, "No one is allowed to disrupt the Honor Quest Ceremony! Marlon, it's not your turn to challenge yet. Please sit down."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon's rage flared at Jackie's words, but he remained icy, about to retort when Rumen, standing high above, quickly interjected, "Marlon, don't act out of line!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon halted, his anger simmering just below the surface.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shot a defiant glance at Jackie, confused as to why his father was giving Jackie so much respect, but slowly, he reined in his power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon fixed his gaze back on Osborne, coldly declaring, "If you're a man, fight me! I told you, if you hurt my sister, I will make you pay tenfold!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne merely smiled, an air of amusement in his demeanor, "You want to fight me? Looking to avenge your sister? Just wait! You won't have to wait long for your shot in the arena!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he turned away, leaving Marlon stunned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The onlookers shared in his disbelief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's Osborne talking about? Is he banking on maintaining an unbeaten streak until Marlon steps up? That would mean over a hundred wins in a row!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow, talk about confidence!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Before Marlon even gets in the ring, Osborne's got dozens of opponents lined up, each one tougher than the last. What gives him the right to think he can keep winning until Marlon shows up?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne really is so arrogant, isn't he?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne listened to the chatter around him, too uninterested to engage in any explanations or rebuttals. With a casual kick, he sent Ebony flying out of the ring and said coolly, "Next!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And just like that, the winning streak continued!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he took down Ebony, Osborne's momentum remained fierce. Even though his opponents were getting stronger, and he couldn't finish them off in one shot anymore, no one could really threaten him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's power was astonishing. Even he was surprised by it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it was the massive blood energy he absorbed from Dark Deity Mosley that made him stronger than even Cuthbert at his peak.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the top-tier fighters ranked in the top three hundred on the Godson Rankings struggled to withstand Osborne's attacks.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he unleashed his Explosive Force, it wouldn't be surprising if he took his opponents out in an instant.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that kind of unstoppable force, his winning streak skyrocketed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seventy wins? A piece of cake.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eighty wins? Just a walk in the park.</p></div>
