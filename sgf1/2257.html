        <h1>Chapter 2227 Looking for Trouble-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?!" Osborne furrowed his brow, sensing several hostile gazes directed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly turned to see three young adults huddled together, their expressions cold and unfriendly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they caught his eye, they scoffed, their eyes turning icy. One of them made a malicious gesture across his throat, clearly intending to intimidate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shadow fell across Osborne's countenance, darkening it with a palpable air of displeasure and unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Maddox stepped in front of him, glaring at the trio with barely concealed anger. "Osborne, don't pay them any mind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're after me. We've never seen eye to eye. Since I recommended you all to join Mystic Sirius Sect's Peak Seven, they see you as my allies and are taking it out on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just ignore them. They wouldn't dare act up within </span><span>the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, fully grasping the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, his countenance had frosted over. Their hostility didn't ruffle his feathers; he didn't even consider them a blip on his threat radar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, those three were no pushovers. Each was at the Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King Level, packing a punch that put them in the same league as Maddox, if not better. One of them even exuded a more formidable aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne remained as calm as a still lake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Nine Supernal Deity Kings? They were like gnats to him. If they had the audacity to stir up trouble, he could swat them away with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In light of his present might, it would be an overstatement to assert that he stood unrivaled beneath the lofty threshold of Empyrean Sacredness. The vast expanse of the cultivation world was a testament to the adage that there was always a greater power beyond one's own. Countless cultivators had been entrenched at the Ascension Ten stage for eons, their long-held stasis at this level allowing their power to fester and grow into something truly awe-inspiring. Even a powerhouse like Osborne would approach an encounter with such a seasoned adversary with caution, for victory would be far from guaranteed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nonetheless, it was a well-founded assumption that those capable of </span><span>besting</span><span> him before attaining the Empyrean Sacredness level were as scarce as stars in the daylight sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe there were only a handful on Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there wouldn't be a single one in the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, three Ascension Nine Supernal Deity Kings? Osborne didn't give them a second thought. But here's the thing&mdash;their ill will wasn't just aimed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It also targeted Anastasia, Zoe, and the rest of the gang, and that was a red line he wouldn't let anyone cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped forward, positioning himself protectively in front of Anastasia and Zoe. His eyes bored into the trio with a steely glare, a silent but powerful warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew this was as much about sending a message as anything. If they dared to lay a finger on his friends and family, they'd be in for a world of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" The three shot each other irritated looks at Osborne's blatant defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them snarled, "Damn it! Some good-for-nothing Ascension Seven punk thinks he can stare us down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who does he think he is, threatening us like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Total troublemaker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged a meaningful glance. "Let's teach them a lesson! They need to understand that this is Peak Seven of the Mystic Sirius Sect, our turf! Maddox can't shield them here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, they marched menacingly towards Osborne, their eyes ablaze with cold-blooded malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's face clouded over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward and squared up against them. "Terrance, Brie, Jamaal, what the hell do you think you're up to? I'm here to get them their identity tokens. They're </span><span>gonna</span><span> be inner disciples of Peak Seven, and I don't have the time or patience for your nonsense. You'd better cool your jets and keep the peace!"</span></p></div>
