        <h1>Chapter 2553 The Root of Everything-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is confident that Clara and Leroy's strength will transform within ten days, becoming top contenders in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he knows how powerful the effect of the Dragon Elixir is.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The effect of the Top-grade Dragon Elixir is comparable to the Elven Sacred Water, and Osborne's power surge began after consuming the Elven Sacred Water; otherwise, his elemental essence would hardly break through to the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten days, with a hundredfold Time Acceleration, equals nearly three years&mdash;enough time for Clara and Leroy to absorb a hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir and complete their transformation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, that's still not enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also prepared Superior Sacred Artifacts and even Legendary Sacred Artifacts for them...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ensuring they won't lose to anyone in terms of weapons and equipment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, those who look down on Clara and Leroy, thinking they are unworthy to represent Eastern Zone 3 in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, will surely be stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dragon Elixir?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were a bit surprised at this moment. It wasn't until Osborne explained the effects to them that their eyes widened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This... this is too precious!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy didn't dare to take it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne forcibly handed it to them and said with a smile, "This is nothing to me, and I can't even use it all! Besides, I have an even more precious Legendary Dragon Elixir! However, you don't have that much time now. Save the Legendary Dragon Elixir for after the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne directly applied a hundredfold Time Acceleration in the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then took out some Legendary Sacred Artifacts and Superior Sacred Artifacts for Clara and Leroy to choose from.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were stunned again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These are Superior Sacred Artifacts, even Legendary Sacred Artifacts!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the zone duel of Eastern Zone 3, Brenda gained overwhelming power with just one Legendary Sacred Artifact&mdash;the Ice Scepter. Yet now, Osborne placed twenty to thirty Legendary Sacred Artifacts in front of them, letting them choose freely!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy were both shocked, clenching their teeth tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were deeply moved, not just by Osborne giving them these items, but even more by Osborne's trust in them...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He possessed so many Legendary Sacred Artifacts that, if the news got out, it would drive many people crazy with greed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne placed them directly in front of them, letting them choose&mdash;this was complete trust in them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't be polite with me!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These Legendary Sacred Artifacts were obtained by chance, and I have no use for them! Keeping them with me is pointless. Pick whatever you like!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each of you must pick three!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Clara and Leroy were stunned once again by his domineering words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They must pick three!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance and didn&rsquo;t refuse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara chose a Legendary Sacred Artifact chain. She used to use a quasi-Sacred Artifact chain, but the gap between that and this Legendary Sacred Artifact chain was simply enormous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, she picked a melee Legendary Sacred Artifact dagger and a Legendary Sacred Artifact shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Leroy, he chose a spear and a shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are all Legendary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, she stared at a Legendary Sacred Artifact bow, hesitating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, don't you use this bow yourself?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I remember your Bloodwrought Bow is just an Inferior Sacred Artifact, right? If you want to use this Legendary Sacred Artifact bow yourself, I'll pick another one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, upon hearing this, picked up the Legendary Sacred Artifact bow and handed it directly to Leroy.</span></p></div>
