        <h1>Chapter 2489 Stellar Region M72-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Regarding Frenetic Storm Warband, we've almost completed the investigation. I have some matters to handle. Also, the situation is a bit complicated, and I can't explain it clearly over the terminal. I'll have Angela come to you. She will accompany you on the mission." Adriana finished speaking and directly hung up the terminal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Angela arrived outside their small courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela was no longer a member of Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Mystic Sirius Sect had already been destroyed by Adriana. Angela completed her mission and returned to Fairy Moon Sect. Now, she was an ordinary Elder of Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne invited Angela into the small courtyard. Then, Angela carefully observed Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Touching his face, Osborne asked in confusion, "What's wrong? Ms. Olsen, why are you looking at me like that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela smiled and said, "Don't call me Ms. Olsen anymore. With your current strength, you should be able to defeat an ordinary warrior at Empyrean Sacredness. Just call me Angela. Actually, I'm not much older than you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne was stunned for a moment, then nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela was at mid Empyrean Sacredness, just a step away from reaching advanced Empyrean Sacredness. Her cultivation level seemed much higher than Osborne's. However, if they were to fight, Osborne wouldn't fear Angela. Although he might not defeat her, he wouldn't lose by much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he gave it his all, Osborne felt the winner would most likely be him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, even if he couldn't defeat Angela alone, he could summon Flash, and even Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just the Silver Beetles raised by Drum could easily surround Angela and kill her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a strength-oriented world. Since their powers are on the same level, they can interact as equals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, congratulations on winning the championship in the zone duel with a huge advantage. Unfortunately, I had some important matters to attend to, so I couldn't be there to watch the match and witness your moment of glory," Angela said with some regret.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smiling, Osborne casually chatted with Angela for a bit, then hurriedly asked, "Angela, what's the situation with the Frenetic Storm Warband? Ms. Alba said things are a bit complicated. There&rsquo;s no trouble, is there?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His parents had been sold to the Frenetic Storm Warband over twenty years ago. He couldn&rsquo;t be sure if they were still alive. Now, he finally had news about the Frenetic Storm Warband. How could he not be excited?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry," Angela said. "I came here specifically for this matter. Here's what we found out. Take a look."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela then handed a document to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly took it and started skimming through it. Then, he frowned deeply, looking somewhat serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After reading the document, Osborne quickly started thinking, pondering, "The Frenetic Storm Warband belongs to a Second-rate Stellar Exploration Organization, specializing in searching for undiscovered resource-bearing planets on the edge of the cosmos, then conducting exploration and mining operations."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its leader is Taylor Watts, reportedly having reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its three deputy leaders are Eden Watts, Shiloh Watts, and Bellamy Kamden, all at advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even on the Racial Convergence Planet, the Frenetic Storm Warband is considered the strongest among Second-rate Powers. It is far more powerful than Second-rate Powers like the Mystic Sirius Sect, where only the sect leader Lenny is at advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, the Frenetic Storm Warband has long been exploring dangerous zones on the edge of the cosmos, facing various Space Pirates and Space Plunderers. They are highly experienced in combat and extremely ruthless and cunning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Currently, the Frenetic Storm Warband operates in a nameless, numbered Stellar Region on the edge of the cosmos, known as Stellar Region M72. The environment in Stellar Region M72 is harsh, complex, and extremely chaotic.</span></p></div>
