        <h1>Chapter 1770 The Final Two Days</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the warriors from various clans at the Divine Peak Nine base witnessed Tristram's divine power projection being easily defeated by Osborne, their expressions turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While a divine power projection didn't fully represent true strength, the stark difference between the two projections hinted that Osborne was undeniably powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Tristram to defeat Osborne was not impossible, but it would certainly be a monumental challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristram's face darkened as he refrained from summoning another divine power projection to confront Osborne again. He had already gauged Osborne's strength in their previous encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore, the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, is indeed formidable! But on the real battlefield, I will take you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice cut through the tension. "You all have two days to prepare. Don't count on weaklings like Tristram. Hurry and find stronger warriors from your clans to join the arena! Otherwise, you're going to face a humiliating defeat..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristram nearly choked on his fury at Osborne's taunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was on the verge of summoning his divine power projection again to retaliate when an elder beside him stepped in to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the elder's own divine power projection appeared in the air, staring calmly at Osborne's projection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human youth, don't get too cocky. The strength of our clan's talented warriors is beyond what you lowly humans can fathom. In two days, your so-called Seven Young Deity Kings will become a footnote in history."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fixed his gaze on the elder, and a smirk appeared on his face. "Is that all you've got? Are there no young warriors left in your clan? You had to send an old man to confront me? What's next? Are you planning to step into the arena yourself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm quaking in my boots at the thought of a late-stage Deity King warrior like you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder's face darkened at Osborne's mockery, and he could only huff in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough of your bluster. We'll see who's standing victorious in two days. You've got a mere two days left to enjoy yourself. I hope you don't chicken out and hide when the time comes. That would be a disgrace for your already lowly Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "You don't need to try to provoke me. I set up this arena for your talented warriors to challenge us, and I won't shy away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My only concern is that you might refuse to accept the loss afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In any case, in two days, the Seven Young Deity Kings of Human Community will be waiting for your young warriors to step up! Any talented warrior above the Deity King level is welcome to try! If you can beat us, I promise you'll receive the rewards I've promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will be waiting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's divine power projection shot a cold smile at the gathered warriors before vanishing into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His real body, far away, also disappeared, entering Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did he know, his words had ignited a firestorm at Divine Peak Nine base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's projection faded, numerous warriors from various clans surged into the air, brimming with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! That arrogant Theodore from Human Community is insufferable! How dare he flaunt his divine power projection in front of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's infuriating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only I could pinpoint his real location! I'd smash his body into pieces myself." someone shouted in a fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! He only dares to be cocky with his divine power projection. If his real body showed up, he'd be dead in an instant. Honestly, he's not worth my time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, in two days, someone will teach him a harsh lesson! What a joke, those Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings. In two days, they'll be the laughingstock."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, let's go check out the arena's location!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many in the crowd began moving eastward toward Divine Peak Nine, eager to see the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was already in Hope Haven, pulling out the thousand vials of Miracle Elixir he had acquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, Bryce, and the others quickly gathered around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "I've just met the young warriors from the other races. They are indeed strong, with nearly a hundred young warriors reaching the Deity King realm! And this is definitely not all. Many more powerful ones are yet to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We still have two days to boost our strength. Here in Hope Haven, with the hundredfold time acceleration, that's two hundred days. Use these two hundred days to enhance your power with Miracle Elixir according to your needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope everyone can make significant progress. In two days, we, the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, need to give the young warriors of the other races a serious shock!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes lit up, filled with battle spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My elemental essence is still weak. I need the blue Miracle Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need the red Miracle Elixir to advance my level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to enhance my Divine Body..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the thousand vials of Miracle Elixir, everyone was incredibly excited. After making their selections, they each entered a state of intense cultivation, determined to reach their peak before the final showdown.</span></p></div>
