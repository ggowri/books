        <h1>Chapter 2591 I Think You Can Win</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Sean's fighting styles are almost identical, both relying on pure strength to directly defeat their opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So their fight wasn&rsquo;t just intense&mdash;it was downright thrilling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoever's strength is greater will win.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the result came out quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When a figure was sent flying and heavily crashed below the ring, struggling to get up but unable to stand, the members of the Royal Family fell silent once again. Everyone's expression turned extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the one knocked off the ring was Sean!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy, though a bit battered, ultimately won. In this pure contest of strength, she was stronger than Sean and successfully defeated her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also became the second regular contestant to advance to the top five.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Royal Family members were on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they lost the first match, they felt it was unbelievable, humiliating, and infuriating, even wanting to harshly punish Yvonne for losing the match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they lost the second match, they were even angrier because it was unacceptable. They blamed Yunus and were extremely furious at Osborne, who defeated Yunus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when they lost the third, fourth, and even the fifth match, they fell silent. Suddenly, it didn&rsquo;t seem so humiliating anymore. Losing so much, they almost got used to it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They themselves started to feel that winning or losing was just normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their expectations for the final results of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel kept lowering. At first, they demanded all of them to enter the top ten, sweeping the top nine without a single loss. Later, their demand changed to not letting a third person enter the top ten!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, their demand changed to not letting any ordinary participant enter the top five.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, their demand changed to not letting a second ordinary participant enter the top five.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, they feel that as long as there are more Royal Family members than ordinary participants in the top five, it's enough!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, in the final match, a Royal Family member must win!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, in the top five, there would be three ordinary participants but only two Royal Family members. They simply cannot accept such an outcome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luckily, Prince Emiliano is up next!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prince Emiliano ranks second on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. His strength is second only to Princess Seraphina! And even compared to Princess Seraphina, he's not far behind!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prince Emiliano will definitely defeat them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Royal Family members will surely dominate the top five! The final top three will definitely be taken by our Royal Family members!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right. As long as Prince Emiliano wins, there's still a chance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prince Emiliano will definitely win!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The final match to advance from the top ten to the top five is finally starting."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The opponents are Emiliano and Clara!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clara, be careful!" Leroy stepped down from the ring and warned Clara with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emiliano ranks second on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, so be extra careful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara nodded. "I know!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to Osborne. "Osborne, do you think I can win?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara was clearly lacking confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Clara defeated Yvonne, the gap in strength between Yvonne and Emiliano was immense, they weren't even on the same level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano is much stronger than Yvonne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano can easily wield the Supreme Sacred Artifact, which alone is something Clara cannot match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara had no confidence at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and said, "If it's against Leroy, you might not win! Because your true strength should be stronger than Rosalie, who ranks fourth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, but weaker than Matthew, who ranks third in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In a direct clash, you probably can't win!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, I think you have a chance to win!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because your Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain is even hard for me to handle, it can completely help you defeat stronger opponents!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Make good use of your advantage!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished speaking, and Clara's eyes lit up instantly. Osborne's words gave her immense confidence. She nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I got it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've all made it to the top five, and I won't be eliminated either! Together, we'll enter the top five!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Clara stepped onto the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy looked at her worriedly and whispered, "Osborne, does Clara really have a chance? I feel like Emiliano is so strong. He has the Supreme Sacred Artifact; I'm definitely no match for him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "If it's a direct confrontation, Clara is most likely no match for Emiliano, unless he makes a big mistake or shows a flaw."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, Clara does have a chance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for the result, we'll know in a little while."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished speaking and looked at the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, the outcome of this battle was the hardest for Osborne to predict. He thought Clara had a chance, but it was just a chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It all depends on whether Clara can find Emiliano's weakness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The time is still too short! If there were a bit more time, I could have given Clara and Leroy the Legendary Dragon Elixir! If they took the Legendary Dragon Elixir, their strength would skyrocket again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Emiliano would be easily defeated by Clara! Even Seraphina would be effortlessly beaten by them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "If their strength were a bit greater, they could take the top three spots from the Royal Family members! That would bring the greatest humiliation to the Royal Family!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne began to ponder seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How can I make Clara and Leroy dominate the top three of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're definitely no match for Seraphina! Once they face her, they'll surely lose! Then there's only one way, and that is..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised his eyebrows, as if he had made up his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's prepare like this for now! Taking the top three would be best, but if not, there's no choice! Anyway, what happened today has already embarrassed the Royal Family enough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's lips curled into a cold smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battles of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel aren't just watched by those present. The matches are broadcast live via projection in every major city of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire Glorious Divine Kingdom, countless people are watching the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, if the Royal Family's princesses and princes of the Glorious Divine Kingdom suffer consecutive defeats, and if they ultimately lose the championship or even have the top three entirely taken, the Royal Family would truly lose all face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, everyone might mock the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, if we really take the top three, we might completely offend the Royal Family! On the surface, they surely won't act against us, but in private..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, his expression became firm again. He thought, "It doesn't matter! Anyway, before entering Necropolis City, they probably won't do anything to us! And after coming out of Necropolis City..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, my cultivation level will have already surpassed Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That will also be the true beginning of my revenge! Even if they don't come after me, I'll settle the score with them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stopped thinking and looked at the battle on the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle between Clara and Emiliano began!</span></p></div>
