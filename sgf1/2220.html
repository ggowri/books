        <h1>Chapter 2201 It's Over-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosive power of Lord Malevolence was completely enveloped by the massive petals of Osborne's crimson lotus form. At that moment, with his absolute defense activated, Osborne was invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the terrifying force of the self-destruction, it couldn't harm him; all the energy was contained within the protective embrace of the lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deafening roar of the explosion echoed for what felt like an eternity before it finally began to fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the petals of the crimson lotus slowly unfurled, they revealed themselves completely unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly returned to his human form, surveying the area around him. It was eerily empty, and he couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence had ultimately ended his own life in a desperate act of self-destruction, yet he had failed to bring about the devastation he intended for Celestara Planet. Osborne had managed to prevent the massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his demise, a war that had raged for a millennium was on the verge of concluding. Even though the Dark Deity Legion still boasted fifty billion members and the Paramount Supreme Clan and all those factions under Lord Malevolence had numerous powerful warriors left, without Lord Malevolence at the helm, they would struggle to make any waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What awaited them was the reckoning from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After enduring countless deaths and disasters, the Human Community finally saw the light of victory ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all of this was thanks to Osborne&mdash;or rather, the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thousand years ago, Celestara Planet was a prosperous world under the reign of the Human Community. At that time, the God of Night was a well-kept secret, completely unknown to the denizens of the planet. He had secluded himself in a place known as the Court of the Sun, where he led a serene life with his six adopted maidens and a dedicated group of guards. They lived in peaceful seclusion, focusing on their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their collective might was truly awe-inspiring, yet they maintained a hands-off approach to Celestara Planet's affairs. They had no desire to seize power or rule over the planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, they preferred to operate in the shadows, and every now and then, they would set off into the depths of space in search of precious treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the arrival of Lord Malevolence was a turning point that shattered the tranquility of Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His overwhelming power descended like a storm of destruction upon the Human Community, the rightful rulers of the planet. In a ruthless and bloodthirsty massacre, he wiped out ninety percent of the ordinary citizens. His aim was clear&mdash;to strike terror into the hearts of the remaining powerful figures and force them into submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the surviving warriors of the Human Community were made of sterner stuff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They refused to bow down to tyranny and fought back with all their might. Sadly, their valiant efforts were in vain, as they were no match for Lord Malevolence's overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when it seemed that the Human Community was doomed to extinction, the God of Night returned from his deep-space odyssey with his maidens and guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he beheld the scene of carnage and destruction that had befallen Celestara Planet, he decided to emerge from his long-standing seclusion at the Court of the Sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made a resolute decision to safeguard the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he declared war on Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle that ensued was cataclysmic, shaking the very fabric of the world. In the end, the God of Night emerged triumphant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alongside his companions, they managed to seal away Lord Malevolence and many of his powerful minions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night and his six maidens and guards were lauded as heroes and bestowed the prestigious title of the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tragedy, however, cast a long shadow over the victory. Only the God of Night and the God of Light survived the fierce conflict.</span></p></div>
