        <h1>Chapter 2254 The City Duel-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela had only gathered data on five opponents&mdash;three from Azure Haven Academy and two from Fantasia Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Leroy Holiday, this year's champ from Azure Haven Academy! A real dark horse, at the Quasi Empyrean Sacredness level and already wielding Sacred Power. She took down Marreese, last tournament's Azure Haven Academy winner who also won the last city duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marreese Livingston, this year's runner-up from Azure Haven Academy. He was the previous city </span><span>duel</span><span> champion too. He's at the Quasi Empyrean Sacredness level, and his attacks are brutal. Very few can withstand three of his blows...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then there's Pero Korver. He came in third in this year's Azure Haven Academy tournament and also placed third in the last city duel. He took down Vadim in just three moves during that duel, and now he's even more powerful and quicker!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next is Tyson Barea, the champion of this year's Fantasia Isle tournament and the runner-up in the last city duel. His power is almost as good as Marreese's. They went head-to-head for a whole hour, and Tyson managed to block ninety-nine of Marreese's attacks before finally getting beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not overlook Clara Rondo, the runner-up from Fantasia Isle! She's a real wild card. She didn't actually lose to Tyson but decided to forfeit their match. Her strength is probably on par with Tyson's, and her defenses are rock-solid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne skimmed through the information in a hurry, his surprise mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These five are all really tough opponents!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three of them were in the top three of the last city </span><span>duel</span><span>. Even the weakest of them could beat Vadim in just three moves, and now they're even more badass! The other two are total dark horses...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>One of them even took down the former city </span><span>duel</span><span> champion! And like me, they've already got Sacred Power, which makes them a real handful!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>No wonder Ms. Olsen thinks it'll be an uphill battle for me to win the city </span><span>duel</span><span> title. She even doubts I can make it into the top three! She reckons if I can land in the top five, that'd be a pretty solid feat...</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But the top five </span><span style="font-style: italic;">isn't</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> my goal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My only aim is to take home the championship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was just the city duel. If </span><span>I</span><span> </span><span>couldn't score a win here, it'd be next to impossible to cut through the competition and eventually qualify for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After noting down the details of these five opponents, Osborne got back to his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by, and before he knew it, over ten days had passed. Even though it felt like he'd been in seclusion for three years due to the accelerated time, his progress was barely noticeable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation level was still stuck at Ascension Eight, and he was miles away from reaching Ascension Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for his dark, space, and lightning elemental essences, they were still in the late stages of Level Ten, not too far from hitting their peak. Osborne figured that once the city duel was over, he could take some time to push himself harder and probably reach the pinnacle of Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What bugged Osborne the most was the Fusion Vessel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had gotten a whole lot stronger, but he still couldn't get the third foundational carrier to sprout. That put a cap on his ability to merge more powers and boost the strength of his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Guess I can't rush things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Let's just focus on getting through the city duel first! Once it's done, I'll have a month to kick back before the Zephyr State duel. I should be able to make a breakthrough by then!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne stepped out of his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look who finally decided to show up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, a bunch of Mystic Sirius Sect disciples had gathered, practically bouncing with excitement as they waited for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they spotted him, their enthusiasm was off the charts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hollered his name, and he grinned, waving back at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, d'you think you can make it into the top three in the city duel? We haven't had a top-three finisher in a hundred years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, it all depends on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've heard there's a dark horse named Leroy from Azure Haven Academy! And Marreese, last year's champ, is also in the game. Their lineup is seriously tough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rumor has it Azure Haven Academy is dead set on snagging the top two spots in this city duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're so full of themselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we can't brush off Fantasia Isle either. They've got their own dark horse, Clara! And Tyson is no pushover..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, the honor of the Mystic Sirius Sect is on your shoulders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't let them get the better of you!"</span></p></div>
