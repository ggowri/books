        <h1>Chapter 2515 Illusionary Heavenly Demon</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Azael said that the Phantomagic Realm is said to be formed from the corpse of a very powerful Beast Clan's Primordial Creature from ancient times, the Hallucimagic Dragon. Everything inside is an illusion. It's an illusionary space! Anyone who enters it will encounter all kinds of Illusionary Heavenly Demons!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The weakest Illusionary Heavenly Demons are comparable to Ascension Ten Supernal Deity Kings, but they appear in swarms. In the Phantomagic Realm, warriors below Empyrean Sacredness can hardly survive, as they would be torn apart by the Illusionary Heavenly Demons!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But those capable of killing Illusionary Heavenly Demons can obtain the Demon Dragon's Breath they contain. If someone kills over a thousand of the lowest-level Illusionary Heavenly Demons, they can gather enough Demon Dragon's Breath to condense a drop of Dragon Elixir!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dragon Elixir can put a person into an Enlightenment State, allowing them to comprehend the world, enhance perception and talent, and boost soul power! The higher the grade of the Dragon Elixir, the stronger its effects!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After absorbing the Dragon Elixir, people can better resist the illusionary space and Soul Attacks!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Recalling the information about the Phantomagic Realm, Osborne did not act immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his Satan's Eye was fully activated, yet he couldn't spot a single figure. Logically, at least hundreds of thousands should have entered the Phantomagic Realm in a short time; it was impossible for him to see no one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most likely reason is that everything he sees is an illusionary space!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne found it unbelievable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Satan's Eye had already reached the Sacredness Level. Logically, he should be able to see through all illusionary spaces. At the very least, he had never been affected by an illusionary space before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, everything his Satan's Eye saw felt so real, nothing like an illusionary space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't figure it out, so he directly called out to Primordial, hoping there was something in his memory about the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Phantomagic Realm was formed from the corpse of a Beast Clan's Primordial Creature, the Hallucimagic Dragon. Perhaps Primordial might even know the Hallucimagic Dragon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hallucimagic Dragon?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial felt puzzled. "In my memory, there's nothing about the Hallucimagic Dragon! But if its corpse can truly transform into such a vast illusionary space, it might actually be a Primordial Creature!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking around, he didn't notice anything unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He simply said, "Osborne, you should be in an independent illusionary space right now! If you want to find others here, you must break it first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"An independent illusionary space? Do I have to break it to find others?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How do I break it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shrugged. "I don't know! It could be some kind of test. Didn't you say the Phantomagic Realm has Illusionary Heavenly Demons? Just move forward. If you encounter them, take them down directly. Maybe this independent illusionary space will disappear soon after!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and nodded. "That's all I can do!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, he prepared to steer the Sacred Artifact warship toward a nearby celestial body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That celestial body wasn't large, with a diameter of less than 621 miles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Osborne now, it was just a slightly bigger rock!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his strength, he could easily shatter and break apart such a celestial body. At this moment, he sensed some unusual power on this star.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He approached quickly, but suddenly, he stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that instant, the celestial body in his eyes suddenly began to twist and deform. In the blink of an eye, it transformed into an enormous Magma Devourer!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a chill all over, an uncontrollable fear rising within him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was the Silicon-based Lifeform's Magma Devourer!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, it was at least hundreds of times larger than the one he had encountered before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "How terrifying must this Magma Devourer be?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its cultivation level reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, or Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, or perhaps even Imperial Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was extremely uneasy, almost ready to turn and run for his life. A Magma Devourer of this size was absolutely beyond what he could handle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Adriana encountered it, she would have to run for her life!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, soon Osborne felt something was off. This Magma Devourer was merely enormous in size, but its aura wasn&rsquo;t all that terrifying. He sensed its cultivation level was only at primary Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instantly thought, "It's not a Magma Devourer! What I see is just an illusionary space, so it must be an Illusionary Heavenly Demon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Illusionary Heavenly Demons in the Phantomagic Realm have no fixed form; they take on different shapes based on each person's memories.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had a deep impression of the Magma Devourer, so the Illusionary Heavenly Demon he encountered took its form.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "So that's it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're just a primary Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demon. How dare you appear before me? You're courting death! I'll slay you first and claim your Demon Dragon's Breath!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately took out his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Illusionary Heavenly Demon looked intimidating in size, its strength was weak. At least for Osborne now, he could easily kill it with one arrow even without using the Solar Sacred Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the moment he drew the Bloodwrought Bow, all the stars he could see before him rapidly twisted, transforming into massive Magma Devourers, all coldly staring at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least a thousand of them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was stunned. He had known before that Illusionary Heavenly Demons appeared in groups, but he never expected it to be like this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a thousand Illusionary Heavenly Demons!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each one possessed the power of primary Empyrean Sacredness. At this moment, they surrounded Osborne like massive beasts. Ordinary people would probably faint from fear at the sight of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing one Illusionary Heavenly Demon, he wasn't afraid because he could easily shoot it down. But a thousand Illusionary Heavenly Demons were a bit of a problem!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, killing them wasn't too difficult either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for the massive size of these Illusionary Heavenly Demons adding extra intimidation, Osborne wouldn't care much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they finally made their move, letting out terrifying roars. Then they unleashed their power, targeting him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "A thousand primary Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons attacking me at once. Even with the Inferior Sacred Artifact warship and Warfare Shield, I'd still be in danger because my defense might be breached!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must take the initiative to attack!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne directly put away the Inferior Sacred Artifact warship. Through an interdimensional travel, he dodged most of the attacks, then immediately drew the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Human Arrow, Arrow Storm!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Sacred Power Arrow quickly took shape and shot out, instantly splitting into ten, a hundred, a thousand...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, ten thousand Sacred Power Arrows appeared in the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They each locked onto an Illusionary Heavenly Demon and shot out with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Illusionary Heavenly Demons were too massive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't evade Osborne's Sacred Power Arrows at all. In the blink of an eye, each of them was simultaneously struck by multiple Sacred Power Arrows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Terrifying power erupted instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those Illusionary Heavenly Demons suddenly exploded, vanishing into the void without leaving any corpses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only strands of black mist lingered in the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew that was Demon Dragon's Breath!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A thousand strands of Demon Dragon's Breath could condense into a single precious drop of Dragon Elixir!</span></p></div>
