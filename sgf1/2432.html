        <h1>Chapter 2343 Bloodline Sensation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was ready to begin training. The State duel had ended, bringing him one step closer to his goal. Next, he only needed to rank in the top ten in the zone duel of Eastern Zone 3, and he could participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel will be held in the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, a grand sacrificial ceremony will be held in the Royal Sepulcher, and all royal members of the Glorious Divine Kingdom will pay homage to their ancestors. After the ceremony, other events will take place in the Royal Sepulcher, including the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne must enter the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel to have a chance to visit the Royal Sepulcher and pay respects to his pitiful mother from his past life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This is the final battle. Although I won the state </span><span>duel</span><span> championship, it was a tough victory. In fact, purely in terms of strength, Agatha is stronger than me. If it weren't for her just mastering the power of the Dark Phoenix, which is still immature, and me coincidentally mastering the Dark Phoenix Flame that temporarily disrupts her control over Sacred Power, I would hardly have been able to defeat her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When it comes to the zone duel, there will be many powerful people like Agatha. After all, Eastern Zone 3 has a hundred states. If each state has one prodigy, that means there are a hundred prodigies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I have a chance to rank in the top ten of the Eastern Zone 3 zone </span><span>duel</span><span>, but that's not enough. I must continue to improve my strength in these three months. Only then will I be more confident."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne prepared to start training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the intense energy fluctuations outside kept Osborne from calming down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he thought of Agatha again. Then, he couldn't help but shake his head. There was nothing he could do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were Isa, Clarissa, Anastasia, or Zoe in danger, even knowing there was danger and that he could do nothing, Osborne would definitely go to save them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his relationship with Agatha hadn't reached that level. He couldn't risk himself to save Agatha. That would be too foolish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "I hope you can make it out safely."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to focus on his training, Osborne walked out of the house and into the small courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne suddenly frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly felt a sense of panic and chest tightness. That feeling came from a very distant place, yet it clearly affected his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "What's going on?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt extremely surprised. He could sense that there was nothing wrong with his body. However, his heart was racing wildly, making him extremely uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He closed his eyes, following the source of this feeling. Then, it seemed as if he saw something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed like a tall figure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was desperately running for her life, and she was injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind her, someone was desperately chasing her. She was in a terrible situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What&rsquo;s going on?" Osborne opened his eyes, utterly confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly told Primordial about the situation, hoping to get an answer from him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After listening to Osborne, Primordial couldn't help but frown and said, "This seems to be Bloodline Sensation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bloodline Sensation?" Osborne looked at Primordial in surprise. Then, he suddenly became serious, his face full of astonishment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Could the woman I saw desperately running for her life be Agatha?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne suddenly remembered what Agatha had said to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "If we are destined, we will meet again. Also, I'll tell you a secret. You have nine drops of my Phoenix Blood in your body. No matter where you go, I can sense you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If something happens to you, I can sense it too. You stole my Phoenix Blood, and this is your karma."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression was extremely serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside Osborne's body, nine drops of Agatha's Phoenix Blood were fused. Because of this, Agatha said she could sense Osborne's location. If something happened to Osborne, Agatha could sense it too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This sensation is most likely what Primordial referred to as Bloodline Sensation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Bloodline Sensation is likely mutual. Agatha can sense Osborne's location and condition, and Osborne can also sense Agatha's location and condition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly feeling flustered and uneasy is likely because Agatha was injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne can indeed faintly sense a location.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is most likely where Agatha is now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "If it's Agatha, that Dark Phoenix, it's very likely. After all, you fused with her nine drops of Phoenix Blood, so forming a bloodline connection is quite normal."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne's expression grew even more serious. "Will this affect my body? If something happens to Agatha or she dies, will it affect me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This shouldn't happen," Primordial said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shouldn't happen?" Osborne stared speechlessly at Primordial. "You were the one who told me to extract Agatha's Phoenix Blood and fuse it into my body. You even assured me there would absolutely be no issues. Now, there's a Bloodline Sensation between me and Agatha, and you're telling me it should be fine. What if there is a problem? What will happen to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial looked a bit awkward and defended, "I didn't know this would happen. But in my opinion, there's a high chance it won't be an issue. Agatha only has a Bloodline </span><span>Sensation with you, not a Bloodline Connection. If there were a Bloodline Connection between you two, her death would mean yours as well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, even if she dies, you'll just feel uncomfortable for a while, and then you'll be fine. Yes, that's definitely the case."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Primordial's obviously unconfident expression, Osborne was a bit speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want to pay attention to Primordial and started thinking quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha is in danger now, being chased by a group of people. She's already injured and likely won't hold on for long. If she falls into their hands, she might die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A magical Bloodline Sensation has appeared between Osborne and Agatha. If Agatha dies, Osborne will likely be affected to some extent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, no one can be sure what this impact will be.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The worst outcome is that if Agatha dies, Osborne will die too. The best outcome is that even if Agatha dies, Osborne will just feel uncomfortable for a while.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne doesn't dare to gamble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne made up his mind and thought, "I have to save Agatha, even if it's just to take a distant look and copy her life essence."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person who wants to kill Agatha is extremely powerful. Even Adriana, a top-tier warrior at the level of Empyrean Sacredness, is very afraid and openly admits she cannot protect Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew he couldn't save Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he couldn't let Agatha completely die. At least, he could get close to Agatha and copy her life essence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That way, even if Agatha were killed, Osborne could bring her back to life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Alright, I'll do it this way."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth. He knew what he was about to do was extremely dangerous. If he made the slightest mistake, he might even die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But luckily, he still had an ultimate method, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p></div>
