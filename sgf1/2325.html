        <h1>Chapter 2270 Championship Fight-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy is invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Leroy, a smile appearing on his face as he took in her taunts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you guys from Azure Haven Academy are all this cocky, huh? Pero said he'd put an end to my winning streak, but he couldn't even withstand one of my blows! Marreese wanted to go toe-to-toe with me, to see whose attacks were stronger, and I flattened him! Now... it's your turn, </span><span>ain't</span><span> it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me, back down? Do you really think that's </span><span>gonna</span><span> happen? If you were any good, you'd come at me straight on! But I don't think you've got what it takes," Osborne retorted, his eyes alight with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Down in the area below the arena, Pero and Marreese exchanged looks, their faces clouding over at Osborne's show of defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy, though, just smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect! If you're not </span><span>gonna</span><span> throw in the towel, then let's get this show on the road! I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> prove to you that I'm nothing like Pero or Marreese! I'll show you why I'm the star disciple of Azure Haven Academy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift flick of her wrist, a searing spear suddenly appeared in Leroy's grasp, emanating an aura of menacing power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in gasps as people shot to their feet, gaping at the blazing weapon in Leroy's hand with a mix of awe and envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Empyrean Sacredness warriors hadn't managed to get their hands on a Sacred Artifact, yet here was Leroy wielding one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is trouble!" Angela's face fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't anticipated that Leroy would have a Sacred Artifact. With her already formidable strength bolstered by such a weapon, Osborne's chances were looking pretty slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heck, he might even get seriously hurt if he wasn't careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Sacred Artifact! Leroy is actually using a weapon? Holy smokes! She didn't need a weapon to take down Tyson or Marreese!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that Leroy's brought out the Sacred Artifact, this fight is basically over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excited murmurs brought a subtle smile to Leroy's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at the flames licking the Inferno Drake Lance, declaring, "This is the Inferno Drake Lance! A Sacred Artifact! It might be a rather ordinary one, but it's definitely not something your bow can compare to! You're the first to make me use the Inferno Drake Lance in this city duel. Being defeated by it? That's something to be proud of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Leroy swung the Inferno Drake Lance, causing flaming dragon phantoms to erupt from the spear, radiating a terrifying presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sacred Artifacts naturally came infused with Sacred Power&mdash;a far cry from Osborne's diluted version.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt a wave of tension wash over him as he stared at the Inferno Drake Lance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder I sensed a threat from you! It's because you wield a Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think a Sacred Artifact's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be enough to beat me? You're dreaming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, a smug grin on his face, "You're getting way too cocky! Let's see just how hot your Inferno Drake Lance really burns! Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's fighting spirit erupted like a volcano. Leroy was the first to stir such fierce resolve in Osborne since the city duel kicked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he pulled back the string of his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't a Sacred Artifact, but it was still a top-notch quasi-Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he channeled his Sacred Power into it, ten menacing Sacred Power arrows materialized, homing in on Leroy like guided missiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy's eyes popped in surprise. "You've got some serious juice in that Sacred Power! Not bad, not bad! Maybe I did underestimate you! But that just makes this more </span><span>exciting. If you run out of steam too soon, taking you down won't be any fun! Come at me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy casually grasped the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance in one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spear's tip aimed squarely at Osborne from a distance, as if daring him on without an ounce of trepidation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne let go of the bowstring. The ten Sacred Power arrows shot off like lightning bolts, streaking towards Leroy at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The championship showdown had begun!</span><span> </span></p></div>
