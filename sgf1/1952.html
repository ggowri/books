        <h1>Chapter 1951 Explosion</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roots of Primordial emerged from the void, appearing remarkably slender and insignificant compared to the roots of the Eighth World Tree offshoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet all of Osborne's hopes rested on this very root of Primordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Primordial's root coiled around the Bloodstrike Orb, it immediately plunged back into the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems the World Tree offshoots have mastered spatial power! Their roots can traverse through space as if it were second nature!" Osborne thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's voice was grave, tinged with a suppressed excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, get ready!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I tell you to release the time power, you need to immediately cancel the Temporal Stasis on the Bloodstrike Orb! If everything goes smoothly, the Bloodstrike Orb could take out the Eighth World Tree offshoot in one blow! But if it only inflicts heavy damage, you must act fast to finish it off completely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we let it recover, we're done for! The World Tree offshoot's regenerative abilities are beyond imagination!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can't eliminate it within 10 seconds, we need to make a run for it. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded, and in an instant, the Bloodwrought Bow appeared in his hands, and he donned the Bloodwrought Armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power surged into the bow, activating the three Divine Marks that lit up brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three arrows materialized on the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! Wait for my command!" Primordial instructed and then fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world around Osborne grew eerily quiet. He could even hear his own heartbeat pounding in his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gripped the Bloodwrought Bow with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, outside the Chrono-Spatial Gateway, the Creation Herald was counting down silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smirk crept across the Creation Herald's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "A pathetic tree thinks it can devour me? It's been tangled up with me for centuries, leaving me powerless! Now, your end is near...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After searching deep space for hundreds of years, I finally found the Bloodstrike Orb. Its power is so immense that even if it doesn't completely annihilate you, it will surely cripple you! And then it'll be your time to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and explode. I can't wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement gleamed in the Creation Herald's eyes as he continued his countdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that once the countdown ended, the Bloodstrike Orb would detonate, killing Osborne and obliterating the Eighth World Tree offshoot's lair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eighth World Tree offshoot would undoubtedly be severely injured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, his long-ensnared true form would regain its freedom and finish off the wounded offshoot for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald mimicked the sound of an explosion, but the next moment, he froze in shock. The anticipated explosion didn't occur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive Chrono-Spatial Gateway before him remained eerily still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shouldn't it have crumbled under the force of a violent explosion? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald was filled with confusion. According to his calculations, the Bloodstrike Orb should have detonated within the lair of the Eighth World Tree offshoot by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But nothing had happened!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that my timing was off? Does the Bloodstrike Orb need more time to explode?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow but didn't dwell on it too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had only acquired one Bloodstrike Orb. While he had gleaned some insights, he hadn't personally tested it, so a slight miscalculation in the explosion timing was to be expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patiently waited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time dragged on, the Creation Herald grew increasingly anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that the Bloodstrike Orb has failed to detonate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists clenched tightly, rage boiling within him. If the Bloodstrike Orb couldn't explode, then all his efforts would have been for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" he muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his expression shifted as he sensed a small root suddenly appear on the battlefield of his true form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so inconspicuous, yet it was entwined with a blood-red orb, the Bloodstrike Orb!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" the Creation Herald shouted in terror, but there was nothing he could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was merely a projection, too far from the battlefield to intervene. Even if he could warn his true form, it wouldn't matter because his body was ensnared by countless massive roots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne heard Primordial's voice echo in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Withdraw time power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne retracted the time energy surrounding the Bloodstrike Orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, time around the orb returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a hidden corner of deep space, a colossal figure sat cross-legged, eyes closed, surrounded by a torrent of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the Creation Herald's true form!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless thick roots coiled tightly around him, their immense power rendering him completely immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These roots belonged to the Eighth World Tree offshoot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For over three centuries, they had been locked in a stalemate, neither side able to gain the upper hand, both hoping to exhaust the other's strength first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, everything was about to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tiny root suddenly appeared nearby, wrapping around the Bloodstrike Orb as it swiftly approached the Creation Herald's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Receiving the warning from his projection, the Creation Herald snapped his eyes open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he watched the Bloodstrike Orb racing toward him, the chaotic energy radiating from it filled his eyes with a blood-red hue of sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted in desperation, trying to stop the orb from getting any closer, but he was trapped, unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was watch helplessly as the Bloodstrike Orb drew near.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a terrifying explosion erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood-red energy instantly engulfed everything around it, corrupting and collapsing all in its wake, including the Creation Herald's body and the countless roots of the Eighth World Tree offshoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything began to disintegrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing scream escaped the Creation Herald's lips. The roots that had ensnared him vanished, but he felt no relief, only terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed all his power in a futile attempt to withstand the cataclysmic force of the Bloodstrike Orb's explosion, but against such world-ending might, he was powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald's projection outside the Chrono-Spatial Gateway vanished in an instant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Eighth World Tree offshoot was also suffering a devastating blow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His true form was collapsing!</span></p></div>
