        <h1>Chapter 1024 Test</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, that was just Osborne's guess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heart was one of the most vital organs in the human body, and even a Class AAA warrior would die shortly after getting stabbed to the heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The killers from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization were notorious for sneaking up on their enemies with their Stealth Arts, delivering a swift dagger to the heart for a quick kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the vitality within the Crystal of Life was immense&mdash;dozens of times greater than that of an ordinary Class AAA warrior&mdash;no one could say for sure if it would be enough to save someone with a destroyed heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Osborne decided to try it on a person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne prepared to stab one of the Blood Demon members in the heart and see if he could recover. If he couldn't, it would mean they needed to be more careful to protect their hearts in battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he could, that would mean something!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Imagine an enemy pierces a Blood Demon member's heart, thinking it's an absolute kill and letting their guard down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, the Blood Demon member springs back to life, fully healed, and hits back, killing the enemy instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne resolved to test the limits of the Crystal of Life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stabbing a Blood Demon member in the heart was undoubtedly dangerous, but Osborne was confident. He wasn't playing with anyone's life; he had the Light of Redemption to save them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Crystal of Life failed, he could still use the Light of Redemption to bring them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, this test posed no real danger&mdash;just a whole lot of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shared his thoughts with the Blood Demon Vanguard, looking around at the eager faces before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's willing to give it a shot? Raise your hand if you're in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all one hundred hands shot up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A satisfied smile spread across Osborne's face. He pointed at Ninety-third Augustine. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're up! It's </span><span>gonna</span><span> hurt like hell, and there's a chance you might not make it. Can you handle that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ninety-third's heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reporting in, Mr. Augustine! I can take it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne activated the Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Light Realm in effect, he could use the Light of Redemption every three minutes; without it, the time gap would be tenfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here we go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pulled a divine artifact dagger from his Dimensional Space, the very weapon he had got after defeating Crimson&mdash;the top-tier assassin and a Class S powerhouse, ranked third among all the killers in the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dagger was no ordinary weapon; it was a top-grade divine artifact, the only one of its kind that Osborne had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he had little interest in daggers, preferring longer weapons for combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ninety-third felt the power radiating from the top-grade divine artifact, he couldn't help but swallow hard. Still, he stood resolute, ready for whatever was to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick smile, Osborne lunged forward, stabbing the divine artifact dagger deep into Ninety-third's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp blade pierced through flesh easily, puncturing Ninety-third's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed from the wound and cascaded down the dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ninety-third's face went pale, his body stiffening as vitality rapidly faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If nothing changed, he would collapse and die within ten seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the vitality from the Crystal of Life surged into Ninety-third's body, replenishing what was lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miraculously, his vitality was back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, quickly withdrawing the dagger. Almost immediately, he witnessed Ninety-third's wounds begin to heal at an astonishing speed. Within mere seconds, every injury vanished, and he stood there, whole and unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ninety-third was back at the peak of his strength; aside from having lost a significant amount of blood, his pale complexion revealed little else that would hint at the trauma he had just endured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a Class AAA warrior like Ninety-third, even losing a significant portion of his blood wouldn't pose much of an issue; recovery would be swift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable, it really worked!" Osborne murmured, astonished by the results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The earlier test had only dealt with a piercing wound, but now, Osborne planned to push the limits further. He aimed to completely crush Ninety-third's heart and see if the Crystal of Life could bring him back from such a terrible fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This next step would be excruciating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Ninety-third showed no sign of hesitation. He was resolute to test it on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a firm nod, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, after piercing Ninety-third's heart, he twisted the dagger, shattering the organ and damaging other internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injury this time was too serious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ninety-third dropped to the ground, instantly losing consciousness. In normal cases, he would be dead with such injuries; even with Osborne's Light of Redemption, Osborne would need to act fast before losing the hope of saving him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Ninety-third collapse, Osborne prepared to unleash the Light of Redemption, determined not to let a valiant warrior die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he froze, eyes wide, as the unbelievable began to unfold before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched in awe as Ninety-third's injuries began to heal, the shattered pieces of his heart slowly growing back!</span></p></div>
