        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, are you really going to let Alfreda leave Elf City on her own and go to Umbra Earth? What if she gets into trouble? Her talent is exceptional, but she's only at Ascension Five!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sherwood looked toward the direction in which Alfreda had departed, his face filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed that, at over three hundred years old, he was unable to enter Umbra Earth. Otherwise, he would have joined her exploration team to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There was nothing we could do! It was her own impulsiveness, her inability to resist making mistakes, that gave the Fire Kingdom a chance to cause trouble. But this might not be a bad thing for Alfreda."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a bad thing? How so?" Sherwood asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah replied calmly, "It's all our fault, mine and your mother's! Ever since your older sister Yesenia left Elf City and never returned, we feared that little Alfreda's curiosity would eventually get the better of her. We deliberately frightened her by telling her that the world beyond Elf City was dangerous...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We never imagined that it would instill such deep fear and even a psychological shadow in her from a young age. She hasn't dared to leave Elf City even a step since then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah paused with another sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Alfreda has grown up now! With her talent, she shouldn't be confined to life within Elf City. She ought to venture out, explore the world beyond, face dangers, and continue to grow...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, no matter how gifted she is, her limits will end up as restricted as mine. It would be such a waste of her potential!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, this time when Alfreda made a mistake and was forced to leave Elf City for Umbra Earth, it might turn out to be a blessing in disguise. As long as she returns safely, I believe she will lose her fear of the world beyond Elf City...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With her talent, she won't be defeated by anyone! She will know no limits..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark of hope lit Uriah's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So now, there's nothing we need to do. We just have to trust Alfreda!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sherwood nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda will surely make it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alfreda had already hurried away from the Nature Kingdom and returned to the Emerald Forest Lodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression turned instantly cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet beneath that icy gaze, a hidden emotion shimmered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was fear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the deep-seated fear buried in her heart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Am I finally leaving Elf City? Am I really going to step into the world beyond? I can do this! Don't be afraid! The outside world isn't as terrifying as those stories claim. They were </span><span>made up by</span><span> Father to scare me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my current strength, I'm more than capable of making my mark in the outside world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I must not be afraid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda took deep, forceful breaths, trying to suppress the fear that had haunted her since childhood regarding the world outside Elf City, but her efforts were in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That fear was too deeply rooted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought that in two days she would leave Elf City and venture into the outside world, even to the dangerous Umbra Earth, made her body tremble, her teeth chatter, and drained the color from her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is this happening?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is it like this?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cowering in a corner of the lodge, Alfreda felt overwhelmed by self-reproach. She despised her own cowardice and berated herself for not being able to conquer the terror within her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Elf City, she feared nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when facing Monica, she dared to give </span><span>her </span><span>a severe lesson. Even when encountering King Ainsworth, she boldly stood up to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when it came to the world outside Elf City, she was gripped by sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, that world was one that devoured people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered her sister, Princess Yesenia. When she was </span><span>young,</span><span> Yesenia would hold her, play with her, and tell her stories about the world beyond Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One day, Yesenia left Elf City and never returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father told her that Yesenia had been devoured by monsters outside, warning her never to leave, lest she too is eaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that day on, Alfreda imagined countless monsters lurking beyond Elf City, their gaping maws poised to swallow her whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For all these years, she had never stepped outside Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she knew that her father had only been trying to scare her. She had learned that no monsters awaited her in the world beyond and that many less capable than her had ventured out and returned safely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the fear still persisted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, punished by the task of searching for ten Flame Gold Crystals in Umbra Earth, and with only two days before she must leave Elf City, she had believed she could suppress her fear of the outside world. She had convinced herself she could do it...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now she realized she couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear overwhelmed her. She shrank into a corner, her eyes wide open as she clutched her head tightly. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw countless monstrous jaws ready to swallow her whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain her terror, Alfreda let out a piercing scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne appeared nearby, having rushed over at the sound of her scream. When he arrived, he saw Alfreda cowering in the corner, trembling and screaming as she clutched her head, and his face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scanned his surroundings with a heightened alert, even activating his Satan's Eye, but found no sign of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?" he asked, perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, what's wrong? Are you all right?" he gently inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sound of Osborne's voice, Alfreda shuddered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her head, her eyes filled with panic and terror. The moment she saw Osborne, she felt as if she had found a savior. She leaped from her corner and threw herself into his arms, clinging tightly around his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body continued to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it?" Osborne asked, momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't even realized what had happened before Alfreda clung to him so tightly. His hands, initially suspended in the air, slowly settled around her slender waist as he gently patted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything's all right! Everything's all right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here. Don't be afraid! Alfreda, no matter what you're afraid of, as long as I'm here, I'll protect you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Osborne's comforting words began to soothe her trembling. Although her body calmed down, she still clung to him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always only used leaves to cover her private parts. Now she pressed herself against Osborne, causing him to feel a rising warmth throughout his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body reacted, pressing against Alfreda's hip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a surge of embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Alfreda had regained her composure. The hard object against her hip made her feel quite uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is that?!" she murmured, and her small hand quickly reached to grab it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't..." Osborne quickly tried to stop her.</span></p></div>
