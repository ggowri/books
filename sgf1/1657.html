        <h1>Chapter 1656 A Plan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reflected on the gap between himself and the Deity King warriors. "The biggest difference is my realm; I'm still stuck in the mid-stage of Celestial Deity. Even with my Level Seven spatial elemental essence and a Level Nine Divine Body, I can't unleash my full potential!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as long as I keep leveling up, the distance between me and a Deity King warrior will shrink rapidly! Maybe once I reach the Deity Overlord stage, I'll be able to face an ordinary Deity King head-on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought ignited a fire within him, and he felt an urge to find a Deity King warrior right then and there to test his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he held back; now wasn't the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The abilities of a Deity King were unpredictable. Even though Osborne possessed Level Seven spatial elemental essence, which could keep him safe, he couldn't guarantee it would protect him from a Deity King's countermeasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't escape using spatial power, he'd be in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused on his goal. "If I can obtain death scent liquid and fully restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I could challenge a Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of urgency washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't forgotten his primary objective for coming to Divine Peak Nine. To acquire the death scent liquid needed to completely revive the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death scent liquid can only be obtained by defeating a Deity King-level Deathborn! I can't take one down on my own, but maybe I can leverage Angelo's strength. How can I get him to take out a Deity King-level Deathborn for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne began to formulate a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he suddenly stood up and gently roused Diana from her meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, Angelo's team is approaching! It looks like they're on the same path as us. We should hide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded, understanding the urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took her hand, and they slipped into a parallel space, using the Eclipsing Mantra to mask their presence, positioning themselves at least six miles away from Angelo's group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Activating his Satan's Eye, Osborne quickly spotted Angelo's team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were a formidable force, composed of over a hundred Deity Overlord warriors, exuding strength that allowed them to move confidently through Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew there were no large Deathborn nests nearby, only a few village-level and town-level ones. Even if they were discovered, those lesser nests wouldn't pose a serious threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To challenge them, a city-level or national-level Deathborn would be necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they traveled, they would pass by two city-level Deathborn nests and one national-level nest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could navigate around these without being detected by the patrols or surrounded by the Deathborn army, they could safely reach the Celestial Crystal mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In essence, as long as they exercised enough caution, there was still hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From six miles away, Osborne watched Angelo, who appeared to be just an ordinary old man at the center of the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only within a national-level Deathborn nest will there be Deity King-level Deathborn! If I want that death scent liquid, I need to ensure that Angelo's team gets discovered by the Deathborn from the national-level nest. If that happens, there's a good chance he'll end up fighting a Deity King-level Deathborn! If he's strong enough to take it down... I could finally get my hands on that death scent liquid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement sparked in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he noticed Angelo glancing in his direction, a slight frown forming on Angelo's brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart skipped a beat, a chill running down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Could he have spotted me? No way! I'm six miles away, and with this thick fog enveloping Divine Peak Nine, he shouldn't be able to detect me! Besides, I'm in a parallel space with the Eclipsing Mantra masking my energy signature!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he calmed himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe he just sensed someone was watching him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, he shifted his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Angelo's furrowed brow relaxed, though his expression remained somewhat dazed. He turned away, no longer focusing on Osborne's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but marvel at Angelo's perceptiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, he can feel my watching gaze! The capabilities of a Deity King warrior are impressive. Even from such a distance, he could sense my gaze."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Becoming more cautious, Osborne decided to avoid eye contact with Angelo and began studying the others in the Deity King's entourage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, a familiar face caught his attention, and a look of disbelief spread across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin had been rendered useless when Osborne shattered his divine power essence; he'd assumed Calvin's journey was over. Yet here he was, somehow brought to Divine Peak Nine by Athena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that Calvin hasn't lost hope? Is he banking on the chance of finding a Miracle Elixir here to restore his divine power essence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept onto Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angelo's team finally reached the spot where Algernon and the others had met their demise.</span></p></div>
