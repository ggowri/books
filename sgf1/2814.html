        <h1>Chapter 2663 Changes-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he was a warrior at Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, he didn&rsquo;t dare to leave the safe zone. He had already stayed in this safe zone for over five days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even felt that he would stay here until the Skyfall Casket closed and he was teleported away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, he didn&rsquo;t notice that new changes had occurred in the Ancient Battlefield. The recurring astral projections around him became different from before, and the battles also changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The once perfectly safe safe zone suddenly became unsafe. In the new battle scene, the aftermath of the fight between two terrifying creatures happened to reach this safe zone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, the warrior at Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness was instantly killed by the terrifying battle aftermath without even having time to react.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, not only him but many others who had been unlucky enough to be teleported to the center of the Ancient Battlefield and had been hiding in the safe zone realized that the safe zone was no longer safe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were terrified, screaming nonstop, but there was nothing they could do because they lacked the ability to escape or find a new safe zone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like that, they were engulfed one by one by the terrifying battle waves and died on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, with a loud boom, Osborne killed another astral projection. Feeling the powerful energy surging into his body, he smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Not bad! If I can kill another ten thousand astral projections, I should be able to break through Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and reach Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. It will only take me a few days to kill ten thousand astral projections."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was full of anticipation, thinking, "If I reach Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, even in a direct clash with a warrior like Ms. Alba at Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I would have a good chance of winning. Even if I can't win, I won't lose."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were filled with coldness. He thought, "If I can reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I can easily defeat Frederick, who has reached Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. Unless he truly becomes an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, I will definitely kill him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The opportunities and treasures in The Eighth Skyfall Casket accelerated Osborne's steps toward revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He originally planned to take revenge step by step, dealing with the weaker ones like Brent, Lorenzo, and Lilith first, then handling Hendrix, Naomi, Quinn, and Callista, and finally confronting Weston, and even Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, he might not need to go through so much trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, &ldquo;As long as I can reach Empyrean Sacredness</span><span> </span><span>Great Perfection, no one but Frederick will be able to stand against me. My revenge is coming, and it's coming fast. Just you wait.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow, ready to continue the slaughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, his expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly noticed that the surroundings seemed to have changed, and the endlessly recurring astral projections had become completely different from before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, a heavily injured creature from the Bug Clan was supposed to appear in front of him. But now, it had turned into a peak-condition creature from the Plant Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't defeat this peak-condition astral projection right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned, thinking, "The combat projections on the Ancient Battlefield have changed. The safe zones around me have also shifted. What used to be safe zones have become dangerous, and places that were once extremely dangerous have turned into safe zones."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he felt a bit nervous, thinking, "The environment on the Ancient Battlefield can actually change. Even the safe zones can change. This means safe zones aren't always safe. Luckily, I didn't choose to stay in that safe zone earlier, waiting for the Skyfall Casket to close. Otherwise, I'd probably be dead by now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit scared but also somewhat relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he felt a bit worried, thinking, "I just hope Ms. Alba and Clara weren't teleported to the central area of the Ancient Battlefield. Otherwise, they would be in great danger."</span></p></div>
