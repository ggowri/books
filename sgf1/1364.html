        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! Get out of here, now!" Ophelia suddenly screamed at </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> her face contorted in a desperate struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the tension in the air. In the battle of consciousness and memory, the God of Time was gaining the upper hand, and it seemed she had always had the advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had held back before, unwilling to harm Ophelia, but now she was serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She intended to erase Ophelia's memories and eliminate Osborne in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the erasure of Ophelia's memories might not be entirely true, her intent to eliminate Osborne was crystal clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get away from me!" Ophelia shouted again, urging him to flee as her body trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply, his thoughts a tangled mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Is Ophelia really trying to save me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You're hopeless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think I hesitate to erase your memories?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost! I need to take full control of this body. If I eliminate him, we can both return to normal. Just step aside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The struggle within Ophelia intensified, her body shaking as the conflict reached a fever pitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go now!" she shouted again, her tone frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear she was on the verge of breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a long, hard look at her, his heart heavy with conflicting emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he nodded, his voice barely a whisper. "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned and dashed toward </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, moving as fast as he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he reached </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, he wouldn't have to worry anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time was powerful, but her strength was limited by the incomplete rules of Blue Planet. In her current state, she was merely a Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it came down to a fight, Osborne wasn't afraid of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here, in the dimensional portal, he couldn't afford to engage her. If they clashed, the portal would surely collapse, triggering a spatial tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The consequences could be dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps they would be lost in the void of space forever, or worse, torn apart by the tidal forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, for now, he had to escape, avoiding a confrontation with the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thinking you can just run away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dream on! You're dead meat! You've messed with my memories, and I won't rest until I've dealt with you! You have to die today&mdash;no one can save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time surged after him, her fury palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was determined to kill Osborne, and at this point, Ophelia stood no chance of stopping her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Control of Ophelia's body had slipped entirely into the hands of the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time itself within the dimensional portal froze, a suffocating stillness enveloping them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne possessed time power, but it was no match for the God of Time. He couldn't break the temporal stasis that had gripped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without breaking that stasis, the dimensional portal would remain inoperable. He would have to rely on his own strength to cover the 140 thousand miles to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he moved swiftly, reaching </span><span>Celestara</span><span> in a short time was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he sensed Ophelia closing in on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing he couldn't escape, he stopped, his expression hardening as he faced her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia wore a cold smile, her familiar features twisted by an alien aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her essence had shifted, and Osborne could see the difference&mdash;a chilling reminder of what she had become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is she? Did you erase her?" Osborne asked, his brow furrowing with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's smile widened, a mocking tone creeping into her voice. "What's this? Suddenly worried about her? If you had cared sooner, we wouldn't be in this mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, remaining silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia continued, "Of course, I wouldn't erase her; after all, that's a part of my own history! But she's gravely interfering with my sanity, so I've confined her deep within the recesses of my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this, all of this, is your fault! You've ruined her! Once I kill you and she eventually forgets you and calms down, I'll release her from the depths of my memory palace to merge with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she can't handle it, then she can stay locked away forever! Permanently shrouded in darkness at the heart of my memory palace! Without her, I am still the God of Time, one of the mightiest Deity Kings of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes gleamed with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at Osborne, her murderous intent growing sharper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, unhindered by her, I can finally kill you with abandon! What right do you have to influence her? You don't deserve to live!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Ophelia stepped closer to Osborne, her power growing increasingly terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes glinted with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Confined to the deepest recesses of your memory, never to see the light of day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found himself feeling unusually perturbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of his hatred and unforgiveness towards Ophelia, his ex-wife, he didn't wish for her to be imprisoned by the God of Time because of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more so, the God of Time intended to kill him!</span></p></div>
