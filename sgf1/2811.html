        <h1>Chapter 2661 Escape</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's figure darted and flickered through the terrifying environment of the Ancient Battlefield, surrounded by chaos and rampant forces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Any one of these forces could easily kill him now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, Osborne made no mistakes. In hundreds of interdimensional travels, he appeared at the right place at the right time every single time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, he arrived at the second Absolutely Safe Zone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The so-called Absolutely Safe Zone is a place where none of the surrounding battles will ever affect it from start to finish. No matter how many times the battles around it repeat, no force will ripple through here. So he doesn't need to dodge or rush to find the next safe spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne couldn't help but take a deep breath. His escape earlier hadn't lasted long, only about a few dozen breaths. But every second felt like dancing on the edge of a blade, leaving Osborne extremely tense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, nothing unexpected happened to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This place is already millions of miles away from the safe zone where I first appeared. Yet, all around me, it's still nothing but battles. I can't see the edge of this Ancient Battlefield, nor do I even know which direction would get me out faster." Thinking this, Osborne couldn't help but frown again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within the range of Satan's Eye, there was still endless battle, still a desolate Ancient Battlefield, and still nothing else in sight. Naturally, he couldn't obtain any resources, treasures, or ways to enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "The Skyfall Casket is only 6,000 miles long. But its internal space is obviously much vaster. When will I ever be able to leave this Ancient Battlefield?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I won't still be stuck in this Ancient Battlefield when the Skyfall Casket closes, or even before being teleported out, right? When does the Skyfall Casket close?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt a bit helpless at the moment and thought, "I just hope Frederick has the same bad luck as me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head and continued searching for a way out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He began repeating his actions, searching for different safe spots and a route to escape. At this moment, Satan's Eye played a significant role.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "In this dim Ancient Battlefield environment, without Satan's Eye, I could probably only see a very short distance. If that were the case, there&rsquo;s no way I could find an escape route. But Satan's Eye can see within 6,000 miles."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne found the third Absolutely Safe Zone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, there was no safe passage between these two Absolutely Safe Zones. He couldn't escape to the third Absolutely Safe Zone through interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surrounding battles caused massive power fluctuations. Each of Osborne's interdimensional travels couldn't exceed 6,000 miles. Otherwise, the fluctuating forces would cause errors in his interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, he would be directly transported to a dangerous area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the two Absolutely Safe Zones must be connected by numerous Relatively Safe Zones to allow him to escape using interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne observed for a long time but couldn't find such a path.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, Osborne could build a One-way Cosmic Translocator and transport himself directly. However, the error of the One-way Cosmic Translocator is even greater than that of interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With just one mistake, he would be transported to his death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne had to give up on that Absolutely Safe Zone and change direction to continue searching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Osborne found another Absolutely Safe Zone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Absolutely Safe Zone was over 4,349 miles away from him, with nearly a hundred Relatively Safe Zones in between. By calculating the timing of these Relatively Safe Zones, Osborne realized he could use his previous method to reach this Absolutely Safe Zone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne continued to act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, such events kept happening. Osborne shuttled through the dangerous Ancient Battlefield, trying to leave it. He was like a spirit dancing on the tip of a blade, constantly moving within the Ancient Battlefield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time was passing quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Give up," Primordial sighed, standing on Osborne's shoulder. "In my opinion, this Ancient Battlefield is endless. There's no way you can leave here. You might as well see if you can find something good around it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said helplessly, "If I could find something good, would I still need to leave here? There's nothing around, just Ancient Battlefield ruins and those endlessly looping combat projections. I can't exactly take some Ancient Battlefield ruins back, can I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne didn't fall into despair and continued, "Primordial, have you noticed that these endlessly looping combat projections around us are getting weaker? I mean the creatures involved in the battles. They don't seem as strong as before."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial began to observe carefully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he nodded. "You're right. Previously, the creatures in those combat projections were at least at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level, with many far surpassing it. However, the strength of these creatures fighting here now is roughly equivalent to ordinary warriors at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became excited. "So, our efforts weren't in vain. If I keep moving forward, these creatures' strength might continue to decrease, possibly even down to Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, their battle fluctuations will hardly be able to kill me directly. In that case, I won't have to struggle so hard to find an escape route and can just charge straight through."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial raised an eyebrow and said, "Creatures at the Empyrean Sacredness level? In the Cosmic Tempestuous Battle, creatures at the Empyrean Sacredness level are nothing but ants. And I'm talking about the earliest of those Cosmic Tempestuous Battles. Later on, creatures at the Empyrean Sacredness level didn't even qualify to participate in the Cosmic Tempestuous Battle. Even creatures at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level were mere ants."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, you're right. If the strength of these creatures in the projection drops to Empyrean Sacredness, you won't have to worry about being killed by the battle's aftermath."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with hope. "Then I'll keep moving forward!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He moved again, searching for an escape route, repeatedly performing interdimensional travel, recklessly testing the line between life and death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After an unknown amount of time, Osborne finally felt the strength of the surrounding battling creatures weaken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The aftermath of the battles around him no longer seemed so terrifying to Osborne. At least, if he wore the Crystal Armor, he could completely withstand the aftermath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed, thinking, "Perhaps I've truly reached the edge of this Ancient Battlefield. The strength of these creatures in the combat projection around me has dropped below Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, equivalent to Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne's eyes filled with ferocity, as he wanted to vent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These damned creatures trapped me in the Ancient Battlefield for so long. Even though I know you have no life and are just projections of the battlefield, I won't let you off easily." Thinking this, Osborne took out the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at a massive Beast Clan creature not far away. It resembled a bull with enormous horns on its head. At this moment, it had just killed its opponent. It was also severely injured and on the verge of death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If no one intervenes, it will soon be killed by another creature from the Bug Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before the creature from the Bug Clan appeared, a brilliant light flickered on Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow. Immediately, the Sacred Power Arrow shot out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was a Heaven Arrow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, the bull's projection was instantly shattered by Osborne's arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne's body suddenly trembled, and an expression of utter shock appeared on his face.</span></p></div>
