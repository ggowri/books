        <h1>Chapter 2463 Reprimand-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Ian and calmly said, "I want to ask General Ian Augustine a question. Which law in the Glorious Divine Kingdom states that insulting a royal family member warrants execution? Is there such a law? If there is, please tell us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't expect Ian to already be furious. Leroy was about to be executed, yet Osborne dared to speak up for her?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was even questioning Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne's words left many puzzled, as it seemed there truly was no law in the Glorious Divine Kingdom explicitly stating that insulting a royal family member would result in execution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, everyone had already accepted such a punishment as the norm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Glorious Divine Kingdom, royal family members held an extremely high status, and no one dared to insult them. If someone actually did, people believed they deserved to be executed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one would think there was anything wrong with it, let alone question whether the royal family had such a law.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, they all felt Osborne was taking a risk too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda sneered, a trace of ferocity flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you're seeking death yourself, you deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you speak to Ian, a royal family member, like that? You're doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Osborne, Brenda seemed to be looking at a dead man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Ian looked furious and humiliated. He glared coldly at Osborne but remained silent for a long time because he knew there was no such law in the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if he wanted to kill someone, would he still care about the law?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is absolutely ridiculous!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was about to say something when Osborne cut him off, "It seems General Ian Augustine can't remember. In that case, I'll help you recall."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the Glorious Divine Kingdom, there are 108,000 laws, but none of them state that insulting a royal family member warrants execution. On the contrary, the founder of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, Emperor Solomon, one of the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet, once left an ancestral teaching."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He said that members of the Augustine family must not arbitrarily bully or persecute the people of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, must not seize the people's belongings, must not... Otherwise, royal family members will face even harsher punishment, and after their death, they shall not be buried alongside the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's voice sounded very calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time he finished speaking, Ian's face had turned very pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian roared, glaring angrily at Osborne. "What are you trying to say?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "What I want to say is simple. You wronged Leroy, so why can't she scold you? She's not wrong, and you should endure it, even if you're a royal family member. Oh, by the way, you're just a member of the royal branch bloodline."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just because she scolded you, do you want to punish her? You even want to kill her. I want to see if the laws of the Glorious Divine Kingdom apply to you. Do you disregard the ancestral teachings of Solomon, the founder of the Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you going to violate the laws of the Glorious Divine Kingdom? Do you no longer regard Emperor Solomon as your ancestor? Are you going to defy the ancestral teachings?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished firmly, as if he were reprimanding Ian. The surroundings suddenly fell silent, and everyone stared at Osborne in shock, looking utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian suddenly stood up, glaring angrily at Osborne, but he couldn't refute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could he refute?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How dare he refute?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only bow toward the void and respectfully say, "Of course, I wouldn't dare to defy the laws and ancestral teachings of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. I was just joking earlier, my words don't count..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Ian restrained all his killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, everyone could feel that the killing intent deep in Ian's eyes not only hadn't disappeared but had grown even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian wouldn't openly kill Leroy and Osborne to avoid giving others any leverage against him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as long as he gets the chance, he will definitely torture Leroy and Osborne mercilessly and kill them without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the law and ancestral teachings, as long as they aren't caught, who would care?</span></p></div>
