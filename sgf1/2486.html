        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Maybe Adriana will show up after the zone duel begins!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stopped thinking about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Gerald again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Gerald was still suspended in mid-air. That enormous, ornate throne was clearly an extremely powerful Sacred Artifact. He sat there quietly, seemingly waiting for something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, someone quickly appeared beside him and whispered a few words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald nodded and then looked at Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Everyone listen up, now I will announce the rules of the zone duel! First, the battlefield for the zone duel of Eastern Zone 3 will be set on a small resource planet far away from the Racial Convergence Planet, Abyssal Planet. Abyssal Planet was discovered not long ago, and just two days ago, the Cosmic Translocator was completed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, prior to this, we only conducted basic preliminary exploration on Abyssal Planet, and no one has ventured deep into it yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have ten days to explore Abyssal Planet and collect as many rare resources and treasures as possible from it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, each of you will receive a list!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"According to the guidance on the list, the more resources or treasures you ultimately obtain, the higher your ranking will be. However, I must warn you, the environment on this small resource planet is extremely harsh, and there are many powerful native creatures. It will be very dangerous, so you'd better know your limits!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Gerald waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, all the contestants found a list in their hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly glanced at it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ethereal Bloom, a specialty of Abyssal Planet, is a transparent flower growing in the northern extreme cold regions, with flowing light on its petals. One Ethereal Bloom can be exchanged for a thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bloody Ivy, a specialty of Abyssal Planet, is a blood-red vine growing in the western desert region, hidden in the desert and capable of draining life force. One Bloody Ivy can be exchanged for five thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Abyssal Bone, the remains of native warriors from Abyssal Planet, can be found across the entire planet and is used as a crafting material. One early-stage Empyrean Sacredness Abyssal Bone can be exchanged for thirty thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. A mid-stage Empyrean Sacredness Abyssal Bone can be exchanged for three hundred thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, late-stage Empyrean Sacredness...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dark Mandala, a specialty of Abyssal Planet, is a flower growing deep within the eastern volcanoes, burning with purple-black flames and covered in starry patterns on its petals, highly poisonous. One Dark Mandala can be exchanged for one million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Abyssal Snake Slough, a specialty of Abyssal Planet, appears across the entire planet. It is the shed skin of a serpent-like creature, patterned like a galaxy and filled with Sacred Power. It can be exchanged for fifty thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly glanced through the list of resources and treasures and couldn't help but feel surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These were all things he had never heard of.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These things turned out to be specialties of Abyssal Planet, never found anywhere else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, if someone wanted to prepare these things in advance to cheat, it would be almost impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the value of these items varies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Low-value items can only be exchanged for a few thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The highest value item should be the Dark Mandala. A single Dark Mandala can be exchanged for one million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. Osborne, from the Sect Tournament to the city duel in Tempest Fortress City, and the state duel in Zephyr State, winning all the way to now, has only earned one million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> in total.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, just by finding a single Dark Mandala on Abyssal Planet, you can exchange it for one million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, equivalent to the value of one million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, with such high value, finding a Dark Mandala won't be easy; they must be incredibly rare. Moreover, places with Dark Mandalas will definitely be extremely dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether to search for high-value but rare and extremely dangerous treasures, or to look for lower-value but more abundant and less dangerous resources or treasures, depends on his own choice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, after the ten-day zone duel, whoever exchanges the most Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> will be the champion.</span></p></div>
