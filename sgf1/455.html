        <h1>Chapter 455 Class A</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the pale yellow energy surrounding him, Osborne broke into a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a new martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After merging the soul of powers with his body, Osborne discovered that his martial art aura could actually fuse with his Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood-red martial art aura combined with the faint blue Devil's Light, resulting in the new martial art aura that radiated a pale yellow glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that this new aura was compelling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he faced the falling lightning, he did not attempt to defend himself, allowing it to strike against his pale yellow martial art aura. He was enveloped entirely in lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against such a terrifying attack, an ordinary Class A martial master or power master would find it impossible to block completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's martial art aura easily kept the attacks at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aura gently swayed but showed no signs of collapsing, providing an impenetrable defense for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this, he steadily approached Alexander amidst the raging lightning strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Alexander stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just broke through to Class A. How can your aura be so powerful? How can it withstand my attacks?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Nothing is impossible. Alexander, do you think you're a genius? How funny! There are countless people more talented than you in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's all the strength you have, then you can go die now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Osborne clenched his fist, and the martial art aura surged into his punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne threw a punch, and terrifying power erupted in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the force behind Osborne's punch, Alexander's expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can this be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander cried out again and quickly summoned lightning, forming a net in front of himself to block Osborne's punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he couldn't stop it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't use any advanced martial art techniques. He simply threw a punch that instantly shattered the electric net and landed heavily on Alexander's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spat out blood and was sent flying again, crashing into the back mountain of the Paltrow Estate, creating a massive pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne taunted. "I told you, nothing is impossible in this world. To me, you are nothing more than this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he walked toward Alexander once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bloodshot eyes filled Alexander's gaze as he stared in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can Osborne's power be so terrifying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty days ago, he had fought Osborne, and while Osborne was strong then, he was still someone Alexander could easily dismiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Osborne wasn't even a Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after Osborne broke through, Alexander remained unconcerned because he believed his own strength could easily handle several Class A martial masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for Osborne having absorbed most of the power of the Blessing of Thunder, Alexander should have already been Class A+ himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Alexander's confidence crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's power far surpassed that of an ordinary Class A martial master, and Alexander felt that Osborne had already reached Class A+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the Blessing of Thunder enhancing Alexander's body, making him stronger than an ordinary Class A Power Master, Osborne's punch would have cost him his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear flashed in Alexander's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was reluctant to admit it, Alexander knew he was no match for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks couldn't break through Osborne's martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne's punch could injure him severely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, he would be killed by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne approach him, Alexander panicked and shouted, "Wade, aren't you going to make a move? You must kill him today. Otherwise, he will become a disaster for our family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade snorted coldly, feeling disappointed in Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected that Osborne would trounce Alexander. Still, no matter how disappointed he was, he couldn't stand by and watch Alexander get killed by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without Alexander's reminder, he was already prepared to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand, summoning the lightning to strike at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed as he quickly retreated, narrowly avoiding the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive pit appeared in the spot where he had just stood, charred blackened earth surrounding it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the strength of the attack, Osborne turned serious, and he asked, "Are you Class A+?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade walked up closer to Osborne, his face cold. "It seems you have some perception. That's right, I just broke through to Class A+ not long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I truly didn't expect that someone I once viewed as an ant has risen so quickly, even defeating Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But today, you still have to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling, murderous intent gleamed in Wade's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "You're so confident that you can kill me? Alexander was also very confident just now, yet he ended up begging for your help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see who you will beg for help later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade narrowed his eyes. "Then let's give it a try." After this, he raised a lightning staff high.</span></p></div>
