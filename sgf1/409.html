        <h1>Chapter 409 Another Medusa?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Isa's antidote, even the luxury of death was beyond their reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasting no time, Osborne lifted their masks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Victor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recognized him instant&mdash;Victor, the third elder of the Paltrow family, a Class A martial master. He had perused his file before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no surprise in seeing Victor's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family's collusion with the Aberrants was expected. It would have been shocking if there were none.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's face was livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could utter a word, Osborne had already forced a truth serum into his mouth. Soon, the serum took effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes later, Osborne emerged from the depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor and the others had been drained of all their vitality by Osborne's blood-red hair, now nothing more than desiccated corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could sense the Blood Cross, now a part of him, growing stronger, a terrifying power stirring within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he paid it no mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Incredible. Out of the nine ancient families in Dampston, five have been infiltrated and are in league with the Aberrants. The Paltrow, Walker, and Luther families. And then there's the Marion family and the Byron family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the fifth heir's trial, after uncovering the families entwined with the Aberrants, he must eliminate their high-ranking members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To complete the trial, Osborne had to take out all the powerhouses above Class B in these five ancient families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, it was an impossible task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family alone had two Class A Power Masters and three Class A martial masters remaining, though two had already been taken down by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Walker and Luther families were no less formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Marion and Byron families were significantly weaker. The Marion family had only one Class A Power Master, Emery, while the Byron family had two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant among those on his hit list, there could be over fifteen Class A masters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't fathom taking out fifteen masters, at least not with his current abilities. Although he had killed Brad and Victor, both Class A martial masters, they were not particularly strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least I've identified the culprits colluding with the Aberrants! There's hope for completing the heir's trial after all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Osborne began his return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Victor, he learned of the Aberrants' plan for the day. To infiltrate the cruise ship using conventional means, rob the jewelry at a critical moment to draw their defenses, and create an opportunity for Victor's group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Victor took control of the ship by force, they could use the thousands of tourists on board to threaten the Draco Group and the Augustine family, preventing them from acting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, the Aberrants' main force could then launch an attack with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Victor's operation had failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will the Aberrants give up the operation? I wonder if the jewelry has been retrieved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Musing to himself, Osborne immediately activated Satan's Eye and looked towards the distant fleet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, his face changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce battle was unfolding to the west of the fleet. Isaac was engaged in combat with a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the woman, Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Medusa? How could it be her! She was already killed by Ms. Hernandez! She's not dead? Impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had seen with his own eyes that Medusa was killed by Serena, not even her body left behind. How could she still be alive? So that woman couldn't be the previous Medusa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her metahuman power...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was extremely grave. A bright light burst from the woman's eyes, and Isaac, from afar, suddenly stiffened. Layers of stone skin rapidly spread over his body, seemingly attempting to petrify him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Isaac erupted in terrifying flames, finally resisting the petrification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne could see that his face was ghastly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, resisting the woman's petrification had cost him a great deal of strength. He had been forced into a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he immediately tore open a dimensional rift and stepped through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, he appeared in front of Isaac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was wearing a skinmask, Isaac instantly recognized him as he emerged from the dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's expression was grim as he stepped in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what are you doing here? Get out of here now! This battle is not for you! This woman is a very powerful Class A Power Master. Her power is to petrify enemies. Even I can barely withstand her! You're no match for her. Leave her to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac quickly finished, and Osborne was quite moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was clearly no match for Medusa, but to protect him, he still told him to leave and face Medusa himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He calmly said, "Isaac, I won't leave. You rest behind for a while. Leave her to me! I'm just eager to see how strong a Class A Power Master really is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the martial art aura around Osborne shone brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was stunned, looking at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, you've become a Class A martial master? When did you make it? That's impossible. You shouldn't have had the time to break through!"</span></p></div>
