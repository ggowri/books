        <h1>Chapter 213 Monstrous Opponent</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena fell silent for a while, seemingly contemplating whether to tell Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But eventually, she said, "The Augustine family's most promising heirs, a total of four of them, will be your biggest competitors in the future. Without any surprises, the next head of the Augustine family will emerge from among you five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first one is Vincent Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent, at the age of forty-five, is from your uncle's generation, the grandson of Godfather's brother. His talent is exceptional. Twenty years ago, at the age of twenty-five, he already became a power master. His current strength is beyond measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is said that his Satan's Eye has undergone some mutation, making it even stronger than a regular one. Now, it's on the brink of reaching level seven, making him the most likely candidate in the Augustine family to break through the level six barrier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face registered astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "A power master at twenty-five?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye nearing level seven, mutated and stronger than a regular one?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of monster is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather's Satan's Eye is only at level six, and he hasn't found a way to break into level seven yet. Just talking about the level of Satan's Eye, Vincent is on par with Godfather?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's power is terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious. He did not interrupt Serena, gesturing for her to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The second one is Matthew Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matthew, at thirty-eight, is in your generation, the eldest among all of you. His talent surpasses Vincent's. At twenty-two, he was already a power master, and he also practiced martial arts, possessing the strength of a martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His Satan's Eye has also reached level six, placing him in the top tier of the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Osborne was shocked, thinking, "Vincent's talent is terrifying enough on its own, but to think that Matthew is even more monstrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A power master at twenty-two?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm twenty-five now, and I'm only a Class C+, not even a Class B, let alone a Class A master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between me and Matthew is immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It feels like I was just a frog in a well before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought Apollo was a monster, almost my age, and already a Class B metahuman. Killing Apollo satisfied me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But compared to Vincent and Matthew, Apollo is nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They are in a league of their own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena continued, "The third one is Owen Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, at thirty-one, is also in your generation, ranking fourth among you. His mother is the heiress of another ancient family in Newport City. He inherited the talents of both his parents, possessing dual powers. By the age of twenty-one, he had already reached the level of a power master with both powers, even faster than Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His Satan's Eye is also at level six."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth, wanting to say something in shock, but ultimately found no suitable words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Monsters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They're all damn monsters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These three are my competitors? What competition?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They are in a league of their own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fourth one is Emma Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, at only twenty-five, is your age, ranking eighth in your generation. Her mother is mysterious, and her talent is unanimously recognized as the best in the Augustine family. Although she hasn't unlocked her Satan's Eye, it is said she has at least three powers. Before she turned twenty, she was already a power master, although it hasn't been confirmed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this point, Osborne was speechless. The four most likely heirs of the Augustine family were each more powerful than the last, each a monster in their own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, remembering these four names, "Vincent, Matthew, Owen, Emma."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew, whether he liked it or not, that these four would eventually become his greatest adversaries. With his current capabilities, any one of these individuals could easily overpower him; they were on an entirely different level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't because Osborne was inherently lacking in talent but because it was only a fortnight ago that Godfather acknowledged him, truly learned about Satan's Eye, and began enhancing his powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a month, Osborne managed to elevate Satan's Eye to level four, reaching Class C+ and even capable of defeating Class B metahumans. Such speed was already quite monstrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in comparison to the four of them, he still fell short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the slowest among the four, Vincent, had become a power master at his age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most abnormal of them all, Emma, had already become a power master by her early twenties, and remarkably, like Clarissa, she possessed three different powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "She hasn't activated Satan's Eye? Why not?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye is powerful. Given that Emma is vying for the position of the Augustine family's heir, why wouldn't she activate Satan's Eye?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remember that Satan's Eye only appears after the Augustine family descendant has had their first sexual encounter with the opposite sex. Could this Emma still be a... virgin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What exactly are her three powers? What could possibly make her willing to forgo activating Satan's Eye?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could they possibly be even stronger than Satan's Eye?"</span></p></div>
