        <h1>Chapter 2623 Cultivation Level Soars</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had been waiting for this day of his breakthrough for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for entering the Celestial Spire, he would have already been unable to suppress his new cultivation level when taking the Perfect Dragon Elixir and smoothly become a strong Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, it's not too late now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne, breaking through to a new cultivation level now was just a thought. After all, he had already reached every aspect and far surpassed the level he needed to break through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne, suppressing his cultivation level was harder, while breaking through was as simple as eating and drinking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, after Osborne sat cross-legged, as soon as he thought about it, his entire body began to undergo intense changes. His cultivation level quickly reached Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt that a certain shackle within his body had disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was as if he had been wearing an incredibly powerful shackle before, preventing him from becoming stronger, but now he had shattered it completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shackle that restrained him had finally broken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt as if he had entered a new world, breaking through to a new level. His life essence was sublimating, transforming, and he was continuously evolving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured. Feeling the sudden surge of power, he was incredibly excited. His body seemed to have evolved into a larger vessel, finally allowing him to wield greater strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was immersed in the surge of his power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne's cultivation level stabilized at primary Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, he entered a peculiar Enlightenment State, which rapidly enhanced all his powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a short time, Osborne achieved significant improvements in all aspects.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elemental essence, including space, darkness, thunder, and fire, quickly advanced from the advanced Sacredness Level to the highest Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Other elemental essences like wind, earth, metal, and water also ascended further, reaching the advanced Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's body was gradually transforming, and the Soul Current Ocean was boiling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everything was improving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt his strength was at least ten times greater than before the breakthrough. Defeating his former self would now be incredibly easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For others, the breakthrough would have ended by now, but Osborne was different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's breakthrough had only just begun.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A vast amount of power was still stored in the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity within his heart. Previously, he couldn't reclaim this power because doing so would forcibly push him to a new cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he could finally reclaim the power now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come back!" Osborne murmured. The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity immediately began to tremble, releasing immense power that continuously flowed into Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's newly stabilized cultivation level began to rise again. Fortunately, the Sublime Concealment Orb within his body concealed the energy fluctuations around him; otherwise, everyone nearby would have been stunned by the terrifying speed of his power surge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt his cultivation level rising rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he seemed to break through a bottleneck and reached a higher level, the mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's cultivation level quickly reached mid Empyrean Sacredness, yet this was far from the end. The power stored within the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was immense, and Osborne had only reclaimed a small portion so far. A vast amount still surged into his body like a roaring tide, further elevating his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, Osborne's cultivation level broke through once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt incredibly excited and thrilled. He had long anticipated that the power stored in the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would undoubtedly enhance his cultivation level, directly helping him reach advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when he truly reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness, he couldn't help but feel excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, at least half of the power in the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had not been reclaimed by him. He could still continue to enhance his strength, and he might even reach Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the power around Osborne surged wildly. It was only when he reclaimed all the stored power from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity that everything finally stabilized.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne still reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he felt that he was not far from Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. Perhaps it wouldn't take long for him to break through to it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, if I want to break through to Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, the power I need is immense. In the end, I'm still a bit short...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, reaching advanced Empyrean Sacredness is already enough for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "The most important thing is that I can continue merging power and enhancing the strength of my Sacred Power. When I broke through to advanced Empyrean Sacredness, I felt merging power became incredibly effortless..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me take this opportunity to merge all the power in my body into one!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne began to take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had previously merged six types of power: the elemental essences of space, darkness, thunder, and fire, along with his physical strength and soul power...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Osborne invincible among those at the same cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Osborne could merge even more power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He first merged the wind elemental, earth elemental, metal elemental, and water elemental into the Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then, he merged the power of Satan's Eye and Death's Stare into it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this way, he possessed exactly twelve different powers, reaching the limit of his fusion."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This fusion went incredibly smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Osborne reached Empyrean Sacredness, it was incredibly difficult for him to fuse powers. Even with his extraordinary talent, he could only fuse three different powers. He had only seen one person who could fuse four powers before reaching Empyrean Sacredness, and that person was Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Osborne didn't count himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he reached Empyrean Sacredness, fusing powers became much easier for him. Anyone who isn't too dull can fuse all the powers within their body into one Sacred Artifact before reaching advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under normal circumstances, the fusion of ten powers is already the limit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne had the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and its special ability, Hyper Fusion, provided him with two extra Fusion Vessels, allowing him to fuse two additional powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, while others are limited to fusing ten different powers, Osborne can fuse twelve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne quickly fused the twelve powers together, instantly feeling his Sacred Power's strength increase significantly, reaching an astonishing level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, as any of his twelve different powers improves, his Sacred Power's strength will also increase.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Finally over!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt his body gradually calm down, and he let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt an invincible sensation in his heart, as if anyone standing in his way would be easily defeated and crushed by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, this was just an illusion after his surge in power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone who just had a breakthrough experiences this illusion, but they quickly recover.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne believed he was truly very powerful at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection? I should be able to defeat it easily now. Even if Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection stands before me, it's nothing!" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that if he went all out and unleashed his trump cards now, even a powerhouse at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level couldn't defeat him.</span></p></div>
