        <h1>Chapter 2293 Set This Duel Right Here-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle. "Is that so?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then the sixth layer it is! Let's make it the third day of the state duel! Before the first stage wraps up, what do you say? We'll sort this out right here by this Translocator. Anybody who doesn't show up is a yellow-bellied coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne locked eyes with Conrad, his gaze full of challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd picked the third day because by then, the first stage of the token-hunting would be almost over, and Conrad would surely have racked up a ton of points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beating Conrad at that moment would score Osborne a tenth of those points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not too shabby a deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad scoffed dismissively. "Works for me! If you're that dead-set on getting yourself killed, I'm more than happy to help. If you don't show your face here on the third day of the state duel, you'll grovel in front of everyone, call yourself a good-for-nothing, and admit you're my lapdog!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, his expression nonchalant. "Same goes for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the time and place of their showdown decided, they turned their backs on each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a lot of people were eyeing Osborne with confused looks on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne can't even hold his own in the sixth layer. He needs Mr. Carroll to watch his back and keep him out of harm's way. So, why on earth is he challenging Conrad to a duel here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Has he gone off the deep end?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's a lost cause!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just like Conrad said, Conrad won't even have to throw a punch. That crazy storm in the sixth layer will wipe Osborne out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What a waste of time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Plain suicide, if you ask me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The gap in their strength is just too wide. This fight's a complete non-starter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the thoughts swirling around in the heads of many onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, Leroy was having a hard time keeping herself upright. She was looking at Osborne with worry in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to speak up several times, but the guy next to her kept shutting her down. "Stay out of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man said in a cold, composed tone, "Conrad's not someone we can mess with! Don't stick your neck out for a guy who's just asking for trouble. Otherwise, you'll drag our whole team into the mud and screw up my plan to make it into the top ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy wavered for ages, but in the end, she could only give a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert spoke up, his voice oozing authority, "Alright, folks! You've all seen what the sixth layer's like. I'm sure after experiencing it for yourselves, you've got a pretty good idea of just how brutal the environment is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, in the upcoming state duel, you'd better size up your own skills before you decide which layer to go for and start hunting for tokens. If you can't hack it in this tough environment and need a judge to come to your rescue, you're out on the spot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm gonna get you all out of here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The state duel kicks off tomorrow morning! I wish you all the best and hope you achieve what you're aiming for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Rupert turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a sweet-sounding voice chimed in, "Mr. Carroll, can we head into the seventh layer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone's eyes darted towards the speaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert looked at Agatha, surprise etched on his face and his brows knitted together. "Agatha, I wouldn't recommend that. Even a bunch of Empyrean Sacredness warriors can't keep themselves safe in the seventh layer. And besides, there aren't any state-duel tokens in the seventh layer. It's a dead end if you ask me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha gave a faint smile. "But I've heard that in the Arctic Maw Chasm, starting from the seventh layer down, there's this super-precious cultivation resource called Frost-kissed Heart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frost-kissed Heart can not only beef up your physical body but also make it a breeze to meld with power. Even for Empyrean Sacredness warriors, Frost-kissed Heart is worth its weight in gold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really keen on getting my hands on the Frost-kissed Heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, Rupert's frown deepened. "There's really Frost-kissed Heart in the Arctic Maw Chasm, starting from the seventh layer on down! But it's rarer than hen's teeth. It's no walk in the park to find it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just the fact that it's there is good enough for me!" Agatha said, gave a slight nod, and then kept her lips zipped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert furrowed his brow, and finally said, "Anyway, I still think you shouldn't go into the seventh layer. You might end up biting the dust in there. Come on! Let's get out of here!"</span></p></div>
