        <h1>Chapter 2568 Encountering the Enemy</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Frederick and Callista walk into the Royal Sepulcher, Osborne clenched his fists, struggling to contain the hatred and killing intent within him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he knew he had to endure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick and Callista are the strongest warriors on Racial Convergence Planet, both at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level. Ordinary warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection are no match for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Frederick, along with Anthony from Evernight Court and Russell from Phantom Commerce Guild, are hailed as the three strongest warriors on Racial Convergence Planet. Their strength is said to rival the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet from the past, being recognized as the most powerful warriors on Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness also varies in strength, generally divided into three tiers: Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, and Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Racial Convergence Planet, only three people are at Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness: Frederick of Glorious Divine Kingdom, Anthony of Evernight Court, and Russell of Phantom Commerce Guild.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Racial Convergence Planet, they are invincible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Racial Convergence Planet, there are hundreds of people at Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana of Fairy Moon Sect was once at Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. In Glorious Divine Kingdom, fewer than five people are stronger than her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that was in the past.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Recently, after obtaining over a hundred drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir from Osborne, Adriana's strength has improved again. In her own words, she is close to reaching Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for whether Adriana's strength can already be considered at Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, only she knows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In any case, those at Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness are the most powerful on Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, those at Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness are also incredibly powerful, each capable of dominating a region. Unless they encounter the three at Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, they fear no one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even those at Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness are far stronger than those at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista had already reached Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness a thousand years ago. Now, in Osborne's view, Callista has become even stronger. However, Osborne is not sure if she has reached Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, Callista is definitely not stronger than Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even if Callista is only at Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, Osborne now absolutely cannot defeat her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Frederick and Callista sense Osborne's killing intent, they can easily deal with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So at this moment, Osborne can only strive to suppress his hatred and killing intent, then lower his head, not daring to look at them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, all the soldiers of the Glorious Divine Kingdom around him were bowing their heads toward Frederick and Callista at this moment, looking very respectful. So, Osborne's behavior did not stand out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick and Callista also didn't notice anything unusual about Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the two of them entered the Royal Sepulcher first, many people familiar to Osborne appeared one after another, including Frederick's other wives, Weston, Quinn, Grand Princess Naomi Augustine, Hendrix, Brent, Seraphina, Emiliano, Matthew, and so on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first to enter the Royal Sepulcher were members of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family, followed by high-ranking generals and officials of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, and finally representatives of various major forces. Among this group, Osborne saw Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana walked at the forefront of all the leaders of the forces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering the Royal Sepulcher, her gaze quickly locked onto Osborne. She gave a slight smile in his direction and then turned her head away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana's voice echoed in Osborne's mind. "Something's off with you. What happened? Why are you suppressing anger and hatred? Did someone bully you? Tell me. I'll help you get revenge."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne was stunned</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Adriana noticed I was suppressing anger and hatred just by looking at me. I thought I had controlled it well. Doesn't this mean other supreme warriors have also noticed my abnormality?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, normal people wouldn't think the anger and hatred he was suppressing were directed at Frederick, Callista, and other members of the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Adriana thought Osborne had been bullied and even wanted to avenge him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment and said to Adriana through Telepathy, "Ms. Alba, thank you for your concern. I'm fine. I can handle it myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana said, "Alright. Since you're confident, I won't interfere. But if you really have a problem you can't solve, remember to come to me. Don't ever think asking a woman for help is something shameful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her playful voice left Osborne slightly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that Adriana seemed a bit different after her strength improved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Has Ms. Alba's personality changed? Or is it because we're more familiar with each other, and this is how Ms. Alba truly is?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne felt that this version of Adriana was easier to get along with, rather than just being someone so powerful that he could only look up to.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded and said, "Alright, I got it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, Adriana said no more. She had already taken her seat. At this point, everyone else had sat down except for the members of the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The members of the Royal Family, led by Frederick, faced the direction of the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the crowd, Osborne looked at them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick, Callista, Weston, Lorenzo, Lilith, Quinn, Naomi, Hendrix, and Brent were his main enemies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, their strength had all reached a very high level. Among them, the weakest, Brent, was now at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't actually very old. In his previous life, he was Osborne's younger brother.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lorenzo and Lilith are even younger than Hendrix, being only a little over a thousand years old. However, they have already reached the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, clearly demonstrating remarkable talent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from the two of them, Hendrix was also at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. His energy seemed denser than theirs, as if he was about to reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston, Quinn, and Naomi had all reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, the most formidable was Weston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt an incredibly terrifying power in Weston, even more frightening and stronger than his mother Callista.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Weston has definitely reached Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. He might not be as strong as Ms. Alba, but they're almost on the same level</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strength of his main enemies was overwhelmingly powerful and terrifying. Among them, only one was at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, three were at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, and the rest were at Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, Quinn, Naomi, and Callista were at Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, while Weston was at Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the Glorious Divine Emperor, Frederick, Osborne's father in his previous life, he was at Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their strength was overwhelming, so with Osborne's current power, he wasn't very confident even against the weakest of them, Hendrix, who was only at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne felt no fear and refused to back down. No matter how strong these enemies were, he had to seek revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No one can stop me!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne cast a deep glance at those people before quickly suppressing his anger and hatred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony was finally about to begin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Led by Frederick, the Royal Family members knelt before the Royal Sepulcher, facing the entire Royal Sepulcher, and began an incredibly grand sacrificial ceremony.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the entire Supreme Overlord Mount trembled, emitting radiant multicolored light that enveloped Frederick.</span></p></div>
