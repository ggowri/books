        <h1>Chapter 2274 Stormbringer Ring-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The awe in the disciples' eyes was plain as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally managed to wriggle free from the excited crowd and made his way back to his quarters. There, he was informed that the Mystic Sirius Sect had set aside a new place for him to live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a vast estate perched near the summit of Peak Seven, boasting a breathtaking environment and with the Elders' residences nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far off was Angela's abode. This area was usually reserved strictly for the Elders, but in light of Osborne's recent victory in the city duel, an exception was made for him to reside there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't have cared less. As soon as he stepped inside, he got right down to preparing for his period of seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city duel might have wrapped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there were still two major hoops to jump through before the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel&mdash;the state duel and the zone duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the state duel kicked off, the challenge of making a mark would skyrocket. After all, Zephyr State was home to over a hundred cities, and Tempest Fortress City was just a relatively obscure one. Historically, the representatives from Tempest Fortress City had rarely shined in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten years back, not a single one had even made it into the top hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The biggest shake-up in the rules was that the state duel wasn't just a matter of one-on-one showdowns anymore. Raw strength alone wouldn't cut it. It would turn into a cut-throat scramble for resources and alliances in a wild and untamed arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Teams could be formed, and participants were allowed to wield defensive divine artifacts and Sacred Artifacts. It was an entirely different game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he couldn't solely rely on luck to make it into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why he had agreed to team up with Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Osborne understood that he couldn't pin all his hopes on others. The key to advancing lay in his own strength; he needed to become even more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The State Duel was going to be a showdown filled with heavy hitters. There might even be young guns from First-rate Powers. With his current skills, it'd be next to impossible for him to make a name for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The competition will be fierce in the state duel. Leroy and Clara have already tapped into Sacred Power! When I faced them, I barely had the upper hand. My only advantages were my stamina and raw physical strength... But in the state duel, there will be plenty of others like Leroy and Clara, probably over a hundred of them!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If they decide to team up, I might not stand a chance! So, I have to make the most of this month before the state duel begins to boost my strength!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>One month should be enough for me to break through to Ascension Nine! But the real priority is to enhance my Sacred Power!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If I can blend a third type of power into my Sacred Power, my odds of making a splash in the state duel will shoot through the roof!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne got himself settled to start his period of seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he maxed out the time power, a single month could feel like over eight years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Eight years of solid training&mdash;I just can't believe I won't be able to combine more powers and beef up my Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, he threw himself into his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the days ticked by, Osborne's face grew grimmer and grimmer. He'd hit a dead end. No matter how hard he pushed himself, he couldn't get his Fusion Vessel to generate a third foundational carrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without that third carrier, there was no way he could merge a new power into his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What on earth am I going to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne couldn't help but envy those who had experienced mentors to guide them. If only there were someone powerful enough to give him a little advice, perhaps he could turn his current situation around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Should I go and look for Ms. Olsen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But how could I even broach the subject? The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is my secret&mdash;I can't let Ms. Olsen in on that! Besides, she probably wouldn't have a clue how to help me get the Fusion Vessel to generate a third foundational carrier anyway.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sigh, Osborne resolved to rely on himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his terminal beeped, and to his surprise, it was Angela reaching out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly answered the call and heard her voice. "Osborne, come on over to my place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got that surprise I promised you </span><span>all ready</span><span>! Hurry up and get here!"</span><span> </span></p></div>
