        <h1>Chapter 2531 Furious Dalia</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia's face turned ferocious. While swiftly expelling Osborne's Soulbrand from the Bewitching Lantern, she was also searching for Osborne's location.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those dozen terrifying tentacles frantically searched through the crowd, piercing the chests of suspected individuals one by one, killing them instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're dead! No matter where you hide, you're dead! Once I expel your Soulbrand from the Bewitching Lantern, I will track you down!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne realized he was in big trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne realized he was in big trouble. One of Dalia's tentacles had just swept past him, instantly killing a person nearby with a cultivation level at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne's exposed cultivation level was only at advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Dalia believed that anyone capable of silently leaving a Soulbrand on the Bewitching Lantern must have a cultivation level at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So his current targets are only those with a cultivation level at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But once everyone with a cultivation level at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection is eliminated, it will be the turn of those at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, and by then, Osborne won't escape either!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time was running out, and Osborne's Soulbrand on the Bewitching Lantern was no match for Dalia's soul power. Osborne couldn't find any way out of the predicament.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he could only hope that Adriana would notice the anomaly in the Phantomagic Realm, appear in time, and kill Dalia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne thought again and felt that even if Adriana appeared, it would only be courting death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This place is shrouded by the Supreme Bewitching Formation, so even if Adriana enters, she will most likely be affected and won't be a match for Dalia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, is there any way?" Osborne asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial didn't respond immediately; it was clear he was also trying to find a solution but hadn't thought of one yet. He had long merged with Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, and if Osborne died, he wouldn't escape either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If there were a way, he would have said it already.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like we can only have the Warfare Ancient Tree forcibly take the Bewitching Lantern away! That way, although I can't use the power of the Bewitching Lantern against Dalia, Dalia also won't be able to use the power of the Bewitching Formation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, everyone will wake up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That way, I can take advantage of the chaos to escape. As long as I can get out of the Phantomagic Realm, I can contact Adriana and have her deal with Dalia!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with determination.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There&rsquo;s a problem with this plan: the Phantomagic Realm hasn&rsquo;t completely collapsed yet, and with Osborne&rsquo;s current strength, he can&rsquo;t forcibly leave the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But anyway, it's better than waiting to die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately gave the order for the Warfare Ancient Tree to take away those ninety Bewitching Lanterns.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree did not disappoint Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Osborne's Soulbrand was about to be expelled by Dalia's soul power, countless branches suddenly extended from the void&mdash;these were all branches of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those branches quickly entangled the ninety Bewitching Lanterns and swiftly dragged them into the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, ninety Bewitching Lanterns appeared on the branches of the Warfare Ancient Tree, with all their power suppressed by the Warfare Ancient Tree, including Dalia's soul power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the pink glow within the Phantomagic Realm dimmed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of the Bewitching Formation weakened as a result. Many people trapped in the Bewitching Formation began to break free from its influence and regain control of their own bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation left Dalia in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are those branches?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia's face twisted horribly. He was just about to expel Osborne's Soulbrand and regain control of the Bewitching Lantern, but the Bewitching Lantern was taken away by those branches!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even he couldn't sense where the Bewitching Lantern had gone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he lost control of eighty-nine Bewitching Lanterns.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now she could only control the remaining nine Bewitching Lanterns. The Bewitching Formation formed by those nine Bewitching Lanterns was clearly not powerful enough. Warriors with cultivation levels at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and advanced Empyrean Sacredness broke free from the influence of the Bewitching Formation one after another, returning to normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked around in confusion. Then they saw the withered corpses with pierced chests and showed expressions of extreme terror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dozens of grotesque, terrifying tentacles extended from a woman's body, swiftly killing the surrounding warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What kind of monster is that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The awakened crowd was utterly terrified. They had no idea what had happened. At this moment, Osborne's voice suddenly echoed in their minds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, be careful! That monster&mdash;she's a demonic cultivator. She wants to kill us all here. She plans to drain our vital essence and soul power to boost her cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All warriors with a cultivation level at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection have already been killed and drained by her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her cultivation level is at Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. Even if we join forces, we are no match for her! If you want to survive, attack the Phantomagic Realm with all your strength immediately! The Phantomagic Realm is about to collapse. As long as we can break it, we can escape from here, and someone else will deal with her then!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, everyone immediately understood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Combining the surrounding situation, they knew Osborne was telling the truth. Instantly, everyone who had regained consciousness started taking action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't want to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Break the Phantomagic Realm, and we can escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All of us attack together!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up! That monster is terrifying, he'll kill us all, drain us completely!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, dozens of warriors with cultivation levels at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and thousands with cultivation levels at advanced Empyrean Sacredness unleashed all their energy, attacking the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the Phantomagic Realm's power had already been devoured by the Bewitching Lantern, leaving it extremely fragile, seemingly on the verge of collapsing and disappearing at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, it wasn&rsquo;t easy for these people to break the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, various attacks struck the Phantomagic Realm, making it even more unstable. Even Osborne was attacking with full force, but the Phantomagic Realm still showed no signs of collapsing or disappearing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Dalia extremely angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You&rsquo;re seeking death! I originally intended to let you die painlessly and become my feast! But you dare to resist me and try to leave here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then all of you just die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All of you will become my food, my nourishment! Not just you, but the entire Phantomagic Realm is the sustenance for the Bewitching Lantern, which will help it transform into an Imperial Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don&rsquo;t know who took my Bewitching Lantern, but I know that as long as I kill all of you, I&rsquo;ll be able to find it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All of you, die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, more terrifying tentacles burst out from Dalia's body, like sharp swords, swiftly stabbing at the surrounding attacking crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia's tentacle attacks were too fast, even warriors with cultivation levels at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection had no way to dodge. In an instant, their chests were pierced by the tentacles. Their vital essence and soul power were devoured, making Dalia even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Screams kept echoing. One after another, warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and advanced Empyrean Sacredness were killed by Dalia's terrifying tentacles and then devoured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation was extremely dangerous at this moment.</span></p></div>
