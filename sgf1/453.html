        <h1>Chapter 453 Osborne Finally Arrived</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Fate Staff was being overwhelmed. Although it had once been the weapon of the Goddess of Fate, possessing unimaginable and tremendous power, Clarissa was too weak to wield it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was only at Class B+ strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Clarissa had been at Class A like Alexander, the power of the Fate Staff would have been unleashed more effectively. In that case, even if Clarissa did nothing, Alexander wouldn't be able to harm her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Clarissa wasn't at that level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lighting controlled by Alexander fell relentlessly, resembling the end of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bloodthirsty smile appeared on Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't realize that not far away, Evelynn and Charlie were staring at Clarissa in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie exclaimed, astonished, as he looked at the Fate Staff held high by Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a divine artifact."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn's expression turned cold, but her eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is indeed a true divine artifact," she confirmed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she said this, excitement and greed erupted in Charlie's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A divine artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie glanced at Evelynn, quickly suppressing his greed, and whispered, "Evelynn, what should we do? If you can obtain it, your power will become even greater."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn said coldly, "Since I've encountered it, it naturally belongs to me. But we shouldn't snatch it. Let's wait and see how things unfold."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn's gaze swept over Wade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, she had felt a faint killing intent coming from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could be certain that if she dared to snatch the divine artifact, the Paltrow family would surely turn against them. Among their ranks, only she and Charlie were Class A, while Wade from the Paltrow family was a Class A+ master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a fight broke out, they wouldn't stand a chance of winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn quickly thought of a plan. No one could resist the lure of the staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The best scenario is for the Fatebearer to perish alongside Alexander or to injure him severely. In that case, we would have a chance to take it forcibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that seems a bit difficult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn looked at Clarissa, who was struggling to hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, give up the struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If everything had gone smoothly, our wedding would have already been concluded, but Osborne still hasn't shown up. I told you long ago he wouldn't come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He doesn't care about you at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Alexander seemed confident of his victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip. Due to the repeated strikes of the lightning, blood had begun to ooze from the corners of her mouth, and she had sustained serious injuries. Yet she had no chance to use divine healing to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she could do was desperately control the Divine and Demonic Wings, working together with the Fate Staff to resist Alexander's assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she still couldn't withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it finally going to end?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa murmured, feeling the strength in her body fading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you promised to share my burdens. Have you forgotten?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why haven't you appeared yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't hold on much longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, and then her body slowly began to fall backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand to disperse the lightning attack and darted toward Clarissa, reaching for the Fate Staff in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This divine artifact is now mine. You are mine as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression was filled with excitement. He quickly reached Clarissa and was about to grasp the Fate Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the Fate Staff disappeared, transforming into an intangible substance that merged into Clarissa's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression twisted in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, where is my divine artifact? Where did you hide my artifact?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hand it over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Alexander swung his hand toward Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa watched as Alexander's attack drew near, revealing a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am ultimately going to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, a strange wave of spatial energy suddenly appeared before Clarissa, followed by a dimensional rift opening in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, a tall figure emerged from the dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This person was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally arrived at the Paltrow Estate at the last moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, he saw Clarissa injured and lying on the ground while Alexander was attempting to strike her with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne was completely filled with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he tore through the dimensional rift and appeared before Clarissa to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What awaited Osborne was Alexander's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Alexander, his eyes filled with a beast-like intensity, radiating a terrifying killing intent as he roared in anger, "Alexander, you are dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne punched fiercely toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was knocked flying by Osborne's blow.</span></p></div>
