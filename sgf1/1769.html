        <h1>Chapter 1768 One Thousand Miracle Elixirs</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stellan, the super genius of Snow Fox Clan, declared with a fierce glint in his eyes, "I'll join the fight too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare the pathetic Human Community set up a challenging arena to confront the young talents of our clans? They're asking for trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only will I join the fight, but I'm sure every genius from our clans will step up. If we don't, those lowly Humans might actually think they're formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This battle is one we can't afford to lose, and we must win it decisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to show those contemptible humans that their so-called talents are nothing but a joke in front of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Stellan's words hung in the air, nods of agreement rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! The super geniuses of Raging Elephant Clan will also join the fray!" one of them shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Fire Tiger Clan's top talents will be there too!" another added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder Serpents Clan is in..." came the enthusiastic response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's get moving! The arena is near Divine Peak Nine, and it's a staggering tens of millions of miles away. Even with the Ultimate Malevolence Airship, we'll need two days to get there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's set off right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's crush the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, the warriors from various clans who had been waiting in Wild Flame City for over a month were on the move, their destination set for Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just the warriors but many geniuses who had been in seclusion were awakened by their elders and rushed to Divine Peak Nine to take part in this grand challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare the lowly Human Community challenge the young talents of our clans! You all head over there&mdash;even if you don't get a chance to fight, it's a great opportunity to learn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go and trample the pathetic Human Community underfoot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, within Divine Peak Nine, Osborne and Anastasia were swiftly navigating the terrain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "Up ahead is Celestial Sword Peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's a giant humanoid stone there that looks just like the one I saw before. It resembles the massive statue at the center of Divine Peak Nine&mdash;Shadow Terror Fiend&mdash;but it's not exactly the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder what the connection is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that doesn't matter right now. That humanoid stone has five Miracle Elixirs growing on it, each radiating a different color. I can't let this opportunity slip away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes sparkled with excitement as he gazed at the distant Celestial Sword Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The effects of Miracle Elixirs far surpassed those of Celestial Crystals, and they were much rarer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The red Miracle Elixir could rapidly boost one's cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yellow one enhanced the Divine Body's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blue Miracle Elixir improved elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white Miracle Elixir had powerful healing properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the black Miracle Elixir increased soul power and comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Miracle Elixirs were incredibly precious and only grew within divine peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For most, obtaining a Miracle Elixir was a daunting task, given the dangers of the divine peaks. The thick mist obscured vision, making it challenging to locate the elixirs, not to mention the lurking threat of Deathborn creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, it was a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could easily sense where the Miracle Elixirs were, whether they were guarded by Deathborn, and the strength of those Deathborn. He could effortlessly retrieve the Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened next confirmed his confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there were indeed Deathborn guarding Miracle Elixirs, they were rarely of Deity King caliber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne and Anastasia's strength, dealing with a group of Deathborn beneath the Deity King level was a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they had dispatched all the Deathborn surrounding Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like before, Osborne carefully moved the humanoid stone into the warehouse of Hope Haven, a satisfied smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Suddenly, Osborne's face twisted in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on here? Where's that humanoid boulder I saw earlier? Why isn't it in the warehouse? Who took it?" His brow furrowed as he pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After asking around, he couldn't get a straight answer. The boulder had simply vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved a hand dismissively, thinking, "Ah, forget it! There are plenty more of these humanoid boulders around Divine Peak Nine. Almost every Celestial Sword Peak has one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing special..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, scratching his head. "But this one... it feels different from the last. The previous one could suppress my spatial power, while this one seems... well, just a regular old rock."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't wrap his head around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did he know, if it weren't for that very boulder, he would have perished during his Deity King Tribulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was that unique boulder existed nowhere else in Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking off his confusion, Osborne thought, "Might as well keep searching for Miracle Elixirs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Anastasia in tow, he continued wandering through Divine Peak Nine. Armed with his Satan's Eye, he felt invincible, certain he wouldn't fall victim to any ambushes. Not a single threat crossed his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they scaled one Celestial Sword Peak after another, collecting Miracle Elixirs with every step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he knew it, three days had passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's head back and get ready for the tournament!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked around. He'd thoroughly scoured the outer reaches of Divine Peak Nine, racking up over a thousand Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True, there were more to be found deeper within, but Osborne decided not to push his luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiends and root creatures lurking in those regions gave him the creeps.</span></p></div>
