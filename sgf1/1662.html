        <h1>Chapter 1661 The Celestial Sword Peak</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a massive mountain! What a towering peak!" Osborne exclaimed, eyes wide in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before them loomed a mountain that seemed like a cosmic barrier, piercing the heavens like a sharp sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his Satan's Eye activated, he couldn't catch a glimpse of the summit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the dense fog enveloping Divine Peak Nine, he was still able to see several hundred miles in the distance, yet here, he was met with nothing but the mountain's unyielding height.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a colossal structure, soaring well beyond several hundred miles&mdash;possibly even more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Angelo and the others stood at the foot of the mountain, they appeared to be discussing something, their expressions charged with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This puzzled Osborne immensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly filled Diana in on the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You mean there's a gigantic mountain reaching into the clouds up ahead? That's Celestial Sword Peak! They've stumbled onto Celestial Sword Peak&mdash;what incredible luck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes went wide in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had fairly average vision, and with the thick fog at Divine Peak Nine, anything beyond half a mile was invisible to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, at that moment, she still couldn't make out the towering peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, shock evident in his voice, "Celestial Sword Peak? That's an immense mountain! Are you telling me that's really what it's called? Why is encountering it such good luck?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana explained, her voice filled with awe, "Yes, its name is indeed Celestial Sword Peak. The name isn't arbitrary; it was given by someone who had ascended other Celestial Sword Peaks and obtained something from there that clearly documented its name as Celestial Sword Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've only heard tales of it in passing; I've never seen it myself. They say every divine peak has its own Celestial Sword Peak, and there are quite a few of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celestial Sword Peak is a hundred million feet wide and three million feet high, like a sword thrusting into the sky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, processing the information. "So, that's what it is. But why do you think they're lucky?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana continued, her excitement bubbling over, "Because there's bound to be Miracle Elixirs atop Celestial Sword Peak! In fact, at least half of all Miracle Elixirs found in divine peaks originated from Celestial Sword Peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're in an unexplored area, which means this particular peak has likely never been discovered before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, there must be Miracle Elixirs waiting for someone to find them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Miracle Elixirs up there? Where? I don't see anything in sight. To me, that mountain looks barren, like a sheer rock face with nothing growing on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure there are Miracle Elixirs up there?" Osborne pressed, eager yet doubtful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there really were Miracle Elixirs, I wouldn't miss the chance to find them," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "As I said, I've never seen Celestial Sword Peak myself. Everything I know comes from overhearing conversations while mining Essence Crystals. Very few have actually laid eyes on it, and even fewer have managed to secure Miracle Elixirs from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Angelo, being a Deity King, undoubtedly knows more than we do! Since they've stopped, it's likely they're considering climbing Celestial Sword Peak to obtain those Miracle Elixirs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I can just ask Riley for more details!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, he reached out to Riley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Riley and the others were gathered around Angelo, listening intently as he discussed plans with Edison and a few others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celestial Sword Peak! We've hit the jackpot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought a detour would lead us to an unexplored Celestial Sword Peak! There's bound to be a Miracle Elixir waiting for us up there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And who knows, we might even come across something even more valuable&mdash;like advanced techniques!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though their ultimate goal was to reach the Celestial Crystal mine, Angelo was adamant. "Since we've discovered Celestial Sword Peak, there's no way we're passing this up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've decided to lead an expedition to the peak to search for Miracle Elixirs. However, we must tread carefully. Celestial Sword Peak is a sacred site for the Deathborn, and powerful ones are likely lurking at the summit. It could be very dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't force any of you to join me; after all, even if we find Miracle Elixirs, they won't be in abundance, so not everyone will walk away with treasures."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scanned the faces of his companions with intensity. "So, who among you is willing to brave the climb with me? If we find Miracle Elixirs, I promise you won't be disappointed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with anticipation as the group exchanged glances, excitement palpable among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To most, the notion of a Miracle Elixir was legendary&mdash;something they had only ever dreamt of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, one of them spoke up, "With Mr. Angelo Royston leading us, even if Deathborns are up there, they won't stand a chance against us! I'm in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count me in as well!" another chimed eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've always wanted to see a Miracle Elixir with my own eyes!" a third added, enthusiasm lighting up his expression.</span></p></div>
