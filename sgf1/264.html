        <h1>Chapter 264 Austin's Sorrow</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was startled by Austin's resolute words and quickly covered her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Austin wanted to help him, even to the point of risking her own reputation, which deeply touched Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened to him and Austin was just an accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Austin seemed to have real feelings for him, willing to destroy her image to help Osborne clear his name. So, he was deeply touched by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No man would </span><span>turned</span><span> down such a noble and beautiful woman, who was willing to forgo her status and let him have his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also liked Austin. However, the relationship between him and Austin could not be known by anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, not for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If their relationship were exposed, it would ruin him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin, do not act impulsively! If you do that, your reputation will be destroyed! How will you explain this to the elders of the Montague family? What will others think of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don&rsquo;t care!" Austin said firmly, "I would not allow anyone to slander you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt both amused and moved but knew he could not let Austin reveal their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Otherwise, what would happen to Clarissa? Clarissa and Austin were close friends. If Clarissa knew about our relationship, she would likely turn away and silently wish me well with Austin.&rdquo; </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;But what about my heir test? I might never complete it. Most importantly, I also liked Clarissa and did not want to lose her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin, do you trust me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said quickly, "I really have a way to solve this. I am just waiting. Do not worry about what happens next. I will handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a moment, Osborne suddenly clenched his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked into Austin's eyes and said, "Austin, I need to tell you something. I am actually already with Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin was stunned. For some reason, she felt a pang of discomfort, her throat feeling tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression became dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "No wonder Osborne did not want her to reveal our relationship; he was already with Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin took a deep breath and quickly adjusted her mood, giving Osborne a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see. Do not worry. I have said I would not interfere with your normal life. I am happy you are with Clarissa. If such an excellent woman likes you, it means my judgment is good.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And, I have also said that you are only the father of my child. I cannot be with you or marry you. Since Clarissa is with you, I am relieved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Austin lowered her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one saw the pain that flashed through her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth, wanting to say something but couldn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had promised Austin that he would be responsible for her, marry her, and do everything possible to gain the Montague family's approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, Austin had refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the sole heiress of the Montague family, which meant the vast wealth of the Montague family would be hers. The Montague family would not allow her to marry and split the family's fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin had voluntarily given up her status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, no matter what, congratulations on being with Clarissa. I am Clarissa's best friend, so it will be easier for us to meet now that you are with her. Do not forget, you promised to be the father of my child! I have not gotten pregnant yet, so I will be looking for you in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Austin tidied her disheveled hair, her face slightly blushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, if you want to be truly with Clarissa, it would not be easy. Clarissa is too outstanding. The Radcliffe family probably would not approve of your relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin frowned again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will handle that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, then I wish you success."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Austin spoke quietly together, and the onlookers dared not interrupt, as they were afraid to offend Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Wesley was growing impatient. It was his wedding day, and the ceremony had already started; he could not keep waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Montague, what exactly do you want? Are you really going to forcibly take him away? Humph, if you do that, I certainly would not say anything. But what he did&mdash;assaulting and trying to rape someone&mdash;can never be washed clean!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's words made Osborne and Austin finally stop talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin turned to Wesley with a cold stare. "You are right! So, I would not take him away. What happened will soon be clear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Austin retreated into the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley sneered and turned his attention back to Osborne. "Osborne, even Ms. Montague would not help you now. Are you still not going to surrender?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him away and deal with him after the wedding! Since he has committed such acts, he must pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, his bodyguards began taking action again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, they did not hesitate. Some of them immediately grabbed Osborne's shoulders and kicked his knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get down on your knees!"</span></p></div>
