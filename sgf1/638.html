        <h1>Chapter 638 Points</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stopped hiding and unleashed his full power, delivering a crushing blow with his left fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A torrent of force surged out, splitting into nine waves that crashed into the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enemy's face instantly changed, and he desperately tried to defend himself. But it was no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne was at Class A+ level, his strength surpassed that of Class AA Sam and could match </span><span>Yalynch's</span><span> Godson, Aresta. Now that he's Class AA himself, his power had multiplied several times over, enough to crush Aresta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such terrifying strength was beyond the capability of any random Class AA to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enemy was blasted away, spewing blood in mid-air, but he didn't die. His vitality </span><span>was incredibly strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold light suddenly appeared behind Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed the threat and quickly turned, using the Goddess of Grain's scythe to slice through the sword's light. With a snap, the sword light shattered into two pieces, falling harmlessly to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My magic sword." The enemy stared in terror and immediately turned to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can escape?" Osborne snorted, tearing open a dimensional rift and appearing right in front of the fleeing enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck off." The enemy transformed instantly, growing dense fur, protruding lips, and morphing into a ferocious Werewolf. His claws slashed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "You're the one who should leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne launched another powerful punch, Ninefold Tide Crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Werewolf's thick arm twisted grotesquely, bones breaking with a chilling scream as his body was hurled away like a train collision. He spewed more blood but still wasn't dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class AA experts are indeed tough to kill. Their vitality is immense. If I haven't used the Goddess of Grain's scythe to silently take out two earlier, being surrounded by three Class AAs would be a tough fight," Osborne murmured but continued his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he saw that the six enemies not far away had noticed the battle and were quickly heading in this direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their burst of power was actually at Class A+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they ran, they transformed quickly into four-legged beasts covered in dense black fur with sharp teeth and claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all Werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Werewolves had immense vitality and were hard to kill. They didn't fear pain or injury and were incredibly fierce. Osborne had encountered werewolf attacks at Clarissa's estate long ago, where even the Class C werewolves had shown remarkable vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa had told him then that werewolves' weakness was their heart. Only by crushing their hearts could they be killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The heart, huh?" Osborne muttered, changing his combat strategy. He stopped using Ninefold Tide Crash and decided to try a new technique, Deadly Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deadly Force." Osborne's punch struck the Class AA Werewolf, but instead of harming the body directly, the force penetrated through the skin and exploded inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Werewolf's body jolted violently. Osborne's Deadly Force completely shattered its internal organs. Its heart was turned to mush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with terror and regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful vitality kept him from falling immediately as he struggled to speak. "You... you won't have a good end. The Wolf God will avenge me. The great King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will avenge me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Werewolf spat out blood mixed with fragments of organs before finally succumbing to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "The Wolf God? The King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>? I'll find them </span><span>eventually."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne turned his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Six Class A+ Werewolves were charging at him fiercely. Their claws were brimmed with terrifying energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They saw Osborne kill their Class AA leader but remained fearless and charged recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seeking death." Osborne, unwilling to waste any more time, used Deadly Force again without holding back. He feared that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> might send even stronger reinforcements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of Deadly Force pierced through the Werewolves' tough defenses and skin, heavily damaging their hearts and causing chunks of meat and blood to spray out through their mouths and noses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few breaths, Osborne easily killed all six Class A+ Werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deadly Force really is effective against these defensively strong, highly resilient Werewolves," Osborne muttered. He didn't stop but tore open another dimensional rift and stepped through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, he was 30 miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wondered, "All the enemies at the rare metal mine are dead. I wonder if that counts as a recovery? How many points do I have now?" He opened his Draco Star Wristlet to check his score.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he had killed fifteen enemies in total: three Class AA, six Class A+, and six Class A. It was a significant victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the rules, killing a Class AA enemy earned 100 points, a Class A+ enemy earned 30 points, and a Class A enemy earned 10 points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne had earned a total of 540 points from these kills.</span></p></div>
