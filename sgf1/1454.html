        <h1>Chapter 1453 Conflict</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian stared at Lachlan, her expression a mix of disbelief and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, did I hear you right? You said you want to help your human slaves regain their freedom and status?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, his tone calm and unwavering, "Yes, you heard me correctly. Now, can you assist me with this? I don't want to waste any more time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian was momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slave market could indeed help slaves regain their freedom, but it was an uncommon request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people who bought slaves simply discarded them when they lost interest, treating slaves as disposable commodities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would be foolish enough to come here to pay for the freedom of those deemed worthless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helping slaves regain their status required a significant amount of money&mdash;often not much less than the cost of purchasing a new slave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her time working here, Lillian had never encountered anyone willing to go to such lengths for their slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him, bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, are you feeling alright? Is this really you? Or have you suddenly come into a fortune? If your slaves are no longer wanted, you could just hand them over to me. They're nothing but lowly beings that can be fed with a scrap of food. Why waste so many Essence Crystals to free them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's in it for you? If you have too much Essence Crystals to spend, why not take me out for a meal or buy me something nice? I could offer you some&hellip; extra services in return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Lillian wrapped her arm around Osborne's again, her gaze flirtatious and teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of disgust wash over him, and without hesitation, he roughly pushed her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get off me! Stay away from me. Your kind makes me sick! I'm a guest here, and I'm here to help my slaves regain their freedom. As a staff member, you need to assist me immediately, or I will lodge a complaint against you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His icy words left Lillian momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, anger flashed across her face. "Lachlan, you've really lost it! How dare you push me? I was being nice, and you didn't appreciate it, but now you've crossed the line. Do you even know who you're messing with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she shouted, a group of security personnel from the slave market rushed over, surrounding Osborne with gloomy expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lillian, what's going on?" the lead security officer asked, concern etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him, Lillian immediately feigned distress, rushing to cling to his arm. "Yannick, Lachlan has gone mad! I was just trying to help him, and he pushed me! You have to stand up for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled in her eyes as she pressed her body against the officer, her proximity igniting a spark of interest in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yannick Margery turned to Osborne, his expression cold and threatening. "Lachlan? You're from the Human Community's Swift family? How dare you cause a scene in the slave market and bully Lillian! You must be looking for trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even know who the real owners of this place are? You may be from the Swift family, but that won't save you here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I order you to apologize to Lillian right now, or don't blame me for being rude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Lillian's face lit up with smug satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian sneered at Osborne, her voice dripping with disdain. "Lachlan, are you really not going to apologize? Yannick is from the Rainbow Viper Clan. Behind our slave market stand the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan&mdash;two of the most powerful factions around!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, the Swift family is the strongest force in the Human Community of Wild Flame City, but compared to the Rainbow Viper Clan? You're nothing! And against the Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan? You're just a blip on the radar!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, why don't you hurry up and apologize?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Lillian with a mix of contempt and indifference. "I'm simply here to help my dozen or so slaves regain their freedom and normal identities. Why can't you just do your job without making things difficult?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to apologize?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lillian, do you really think you're worth that? You think you can scare me just because you're trying to play nice with this Rainbow Viper Clan guy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me make this crystal clear, I'm here for business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to spend my Essence Crystals and become one of your biggest clients!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't back off right now, I will definitely file a complaint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And trust me, I can't guarantee you'll keep your job after that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words left both Lillian and the man momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words left both Lillian and Yannick momentarily stunned. They exchanged glances, a flicker of uncertainty crossing their faces before it vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian's voice turned icy. "A big client? Lachlan, do you really think so? What kind of game are you trying to play in front of me? I know exactly what you are. You think you can become a big client just like that?"</span></p></div>
