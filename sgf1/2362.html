        <h1>Chapter 2291 The Terrifying Fourth Layer-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To get into the second layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm, one didn't just go deeper through those underground fissures. Nah, one had to use a Translocator. Plop a Celestial Crystal on that Translocator, and bam! It fired up and zapped an individual straight to the second layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they landed, everyone felt a shockwave go through them. The wind was howling in their ears like a pack of wild wolves, kicking up a blizzard of snowflakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't feel like they were deep underground at all. It was more like they'd been dropped into an ice-cold wasteland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more people started to tap into their divine power to fend off that bone-chilling wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they made it to the third layer. The cold wind here was like a monster on steroids. At least half of the thousand state duel participants were already using their divine power to defend themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't, those howling gales would turn them into human ice sculptures in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert declared, "The first three layers are a piece of cake! The environment here isn't that tough. You guys, being the top dogs of Zephyr State, have got what it takes to hang around here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the fourth layer? That's a whole different ballgame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, next up, we're heading into the fourth layer. But let me tell you, most of you won't be able to hack it. I know you're probably thinking I'm full of it. So, if you wanna see for yourselves, just step into the Translocator."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished talking, a bunch of folks didn't waste any time and hopped into the Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a bit of hemming and hawing, the rest of them decided to follow suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all believed in seeing was believing. They were itching to see with their own two eyes if the fourth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm was really as harsh and uninhabitable as Rupert made it out to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone murmured, "Searching for tokens in the fourth layer would be a game-changer! I mean, each token there is worth a thousand points! Finding one token in the fourth layer is like finding a thousand in the first layer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, there might be fewer tokens in the fourth layer, but there'll also be fewer competitors. You could definitely rack up points way faster in the early goings and leave the others in the dust!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm dying to see if the environment in the fourth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm is really that lousy! As long as I can tough it out, I'm staying put in the fourth layer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, nearly everyone piled into the Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Rupert flashed a mischievous smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really sure you wanna go down there? I already gave you the heads-up that most of you ain't got what it takes to survive in the fourth layer. It's a struggle just to stay alive, let alone look for tokens! But since you don't buy it, go ahead and see for yourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Rupert fired up the Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the group vanished from the third layer. When they came to their senses, they were in the fourth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, a terrifying sight unfolded before their eyes. In this fourth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm, the frigid wind was howling like a banshee. It lashed at their bodies like a barrage of knives, leaving streaks of blood on their skin in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the blood could even trickle out, it froze solid in an instant. Then, new bloody marks appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ice crystals formed on their bodies at breakneck speed, freezing their flesh and blood. Many people let out ear-splitting screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some quick-witted ones immediately conjured up divine power defenses. But in the howling gale of cold, their divine power defenses were no match. They started to freeze and crack bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can there be such a god-awful cold wind? It's like a barrage of ice knives! My divine power defense can't even hold up against it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Sacred Power defense can hold for now, but the energy consumption is through the roof! It's draining faster than I can say 'Jack Robinson'. I won't last long here. Once my Sacred Power runs out and the defense crumbles, I'll be frozen solid and won't be able to get out of here!"</span></p></div>
