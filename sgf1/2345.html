        <h1>Chapter 2282 State Duel Rules-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely flashed a smile and remained tight-lipped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was the point of forming a team if he couldn't lead them to the top ten?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was the rest of the team just supposed to be lackeys for one person?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe that was how things went in other teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the state duel, some folks would recruit others, dangling rewards in front of them in exchange for their help and all the team's points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the pay-off was sweet enough, there'd be no shortage of takers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, most people didn't stand a chance at making it to the top ten, so they might as well snag some perks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was the way other teams operated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela said she could introduce potential teammates to Osborne, but he'd have to sort out the profit-sharing on his own. It all boiled down to the same old story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Angela's view, it was next to impossible for Osborne to break into the top ten on his own. He needed to rope in more powerful warriors to join his team and give him a leg up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne would surely have to fork out a fortune for that privilege.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne wasn't having any of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spending Sacred Crystals to assemble a team just to vie for the top ten?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply couldn't bring himself to do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was determined to go it alone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, he intended to help Clara and drag her along with him into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, thanks for the offer, Ms. Olsen, but I still don't want to form a team. If I hadn't promised Clara, I wouldn't even team up with her," Osborne said coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela let out a sigh. "Fine! It's your call. I'm just throwing out some advice. If you don't want it, then just ignore it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, if you're aiming for the top ten, you're pretty much barking up the wrong tree. Just focus on snagging a spot in the top hundred. Sure, the top-hundred folks won't represent Zephyr State in the zone duel, but the state officials have lined up a bunch of sweet rewards for them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, no one from Mystic Sirius Sect has ever made it into the top hundred in the state duel. I'm counting on you to break that jinx and bring some glory back to our sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That way, I'll at least have something to hold my head high about as the Peak Lord."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a smile and nodded. "Sure thing! I guarantee I'll make it into the top hundred!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought to himself that if he couldn't even manage that, he might as well crawl into a hole and never come out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he asked, "Ms. Olsen, can you fill me in on the rules of the state duel? They're set in stone by now, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela gave a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything's all sorted out now, except for the exact venue of the state duel. Since you're keen to know, I'll walk you through it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Angela went into the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening intently, a smile spread across Osborne's face. He reckoned the rules were pretty decent. With these rules in place, he felt even more confident about making it into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rules of the state duel were actually a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was going to be a free-for-all in the wild!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the time rolled around, the Zephyr State officials would pick an unpopulated area, rustle up some "tokens", and spread them all over the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All one thousand participants in the state duel would enter the designated area simultaneously. Their first order of business was to hunt down those "tokens". Each token carried a certain number of points, and these points would be the deciding factor for the rankings.</span></p></div>
