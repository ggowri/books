        <h1>Chapter 2300 The Seventh Layer-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a dry chuckle. "100 Sacred Crystals just to take a peek? No wonder most people don't bother. But then again, most people aren't me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had raked in over a million Sacred Crystals in the city duel. So, the measly hundred needed to activate the Translocator was a drop in the bucket. He checked his surroundings to make sure the coast was clear, then wasted no time firing up the Translocator. In the blink of an eye, he bid farewell to the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of dizziness hit him like a ton of bricks. But as soon as his feet touched solid ground again, he knew he'd landed on the seventh layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa! Did I take a wrong turn or something?" Osborne blurted </span><span>out,</span><span> his eyes wide with surprise as he took in his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been gearing up for a fight, expecting the seventh layer to be a real bloodbath compared to the sixth. He'd come armed to the teeth with the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow and even pulled out the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, just in case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne'd</span><span> thought that if the going got too tough on the seventh layer, he could hunker down in the Ascending Sacred Sanctum for protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow were Sacred Artifacts, but the Sanctum was in a league of its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though seventy percent of its defense runes were busted, it could still out-defend the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow by a long shot. In a real jam, it would definitely be his lifesaver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as he stood there, Osborne realized all his preparations had been for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seventh layer seemed as harmless as a kitten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him stretched a vast expanse of pure white. In the distance, a colossal snow-capped mountain soared into the sky, most of it veiled in clouds, giving it an otherworldly and serene aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Osborne scratched his head, wondering if the Translocator had gone haywire. Maybe it hadn't sent him to the seventh layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm at all, but to some god-forsaken place instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Rupert had warned him that the seventh layer was a whole lot more treacherous than the sixth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this place? It seemed as safe as a baby in its crib.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was racking his brains over this, his face suddenly went pale. In an instant, his Satan's Eye started throbbing like crazy, and a chill of impending doom ran down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn it all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Satan's Eye had been his saving grace countless times. Without a second thought, Osborne summoned his Sacred Power to shield himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he quickly cranked up the power of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before the Ascending Sacred Sanctum could whip up its protective shield, a soft breeze caressed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a split second, the Sacred Power that had been guarding him shattered like a vase dropped on a concrete floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the might of the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow was no match for this unseen force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the frigid breeze kissed Osborne's skin, it was like a vise around his bloodline. His body turned as rigid as a statue, and his thoughts hit a freeze-frame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Osborne had already flipped the switch on the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's power. Just as his body locked up, the defense runes on the sanctum began to glow like fireflies on a dark night, quickly knitting together a defensive barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cool breeze battered the barrier, causing it to ripple like a pond struck by a pebble, but it couldn't break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the drive core of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum was gobbling up Sacred Crystals like a starving man at a buffet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly but surely, Osborne's wits started to come back to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock and a lingering sense of terror flashed across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>That was a close shave! Thank God the Satan's Eye gave me a heads-up, or I'd be a goner. I owe that thing my life!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>This breeze might seem a whole lot tamer than those storms on the sixth layer, but it packs a punch that's ten, maybe a hundred times stronger! No wonder a bunch of Empyrean Sacredness hotshots bit the dust here.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's the stuff of nightmares!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep, steadying breath. Feeling the Ascending Sacred Sanctum chugging through the Sacred Crystals at an alarming rate, he quickly stuffed 10 thousand of them into the energy core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he got a chance to take stock of his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the spell of that gentle yet deadly breeze, the world was a flurry of snowflakes. Each one felt like a tiny harbinger of doom, sending shivers down Osborne's spine.</span></p></div>
