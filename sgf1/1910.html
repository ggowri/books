        <h1>Chapter 1909 Unexpected Developments</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of the outcome, the Paramount Supreme Clan's plan to ambush the Hudson family had been scrapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strategy had worked like a charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The timing was everything, and it seemed as though Lady Luck was smiling down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stir he caused in Wild Flame City had inadvertently helped the Hudson family dodge a bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he arrived any later, the Hudson family would have surely faced an assault, with those black-clad operatives armed with Divine Marks. Only Jethro would have stood a chance against them. The rest would have been utterly defenseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Hudson family managed to survive, they would have suffered heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, the Hudson family was safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paramount Supreme Clan's focus shifted from the Hudson family to Wild Flame City in the East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Osborne had set up a challenge arena, which had embarrassed the Paramount Supreme Clan and cost them one of their Five Brilliant Scions, Caesar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were gearing up for revenge, tightening their grip around Wild Flame City like a noose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had already made his way to the vicinity of Divine Peak Eight in the East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are we really going to Wild Flame City in two weeks to challenge the young talents of the Paramount Supreme Clan again? They've learned their lesson, and this time, they'll be better prepared. It could get really dangerous!" Anastasia said, her brow furrowed with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "I'm well aware! The strength and resources of the Paramount Supreme Clan are beyond what we can handle right now. My goal is simply to let them know I'm in the East Zone and draw their attention away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for going to Wild Flame City in two weeks... of course, we won't! I may be confident, but I'm not foolish. The Paramount Supreme Clan will be ready to eliminate us all this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll just send a clone to have a little fun instead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia let out a sigh of relief. "That's a relief! I was worried you might be too reckless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you've got a plan, I feel much better! I'll head back to my training now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just be careful up there on the Divine Peak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Don't worry about me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Anastasia and the others returned to Hope Haven, Osborne ventured into Divine Peak Eight of the East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fresh round of gathering Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals was about to begin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne's power had grown even stronger, especially with his enhanced spatial power, which allowed him to collect Miracle Elixirs at a speed that was exponentially faster than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just one day, he had cleared out Divine Peak Eight entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eighteen hundred Miracle Elixirs and three million five hundred thousand Celestial Crystals! Not bad at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled to himself, then activated interdimensional travel to Divine Peak Seven in the East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From there, he moved on to Divine Peak Six, then Divine Peak Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a mere ten days, he had swept through all nine Divine Peaks in the East Zone, except for Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, he amassed a whopping sixteen thousand Miracle Elixirs and twenty-six million Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "The Celestial Crystals in the East Zone seem to outnumber those in the South Zone! With the nineteen million Celestial Crystals I gathered from the South Zone, I now have a whopping forty-five million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up are the North Zone and Central Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Central Zone is the Paramount Supreme Clan's stronghold, heavily fortified and well-guarded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard that the two divine peaks in the Central Zone were taller and more imposing than others, making them far more dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided to leave that challenge for last and set his sights on the North Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne completely forgot about the challenging arena in Wild Flame City. His mind was solely focused on acquiring more Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the Blood Demon members had already used Miracle Elixirs to break through to the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he finished gathering resources from the North Zone's Divine Peaks, he would surely have enough Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Anastasia, Zoe, and the others were accelerating their training a hundredfold, making rapid gains with the ample blue, yellow, and black Miracle Elixirs at their disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their elemental essence, Divine Bodies, soul power, and comprehension were all on the rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne arrived at the North Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first divine peak was not far from Phoenix City, the largest city in the North Zone. Just before entering the Divine Peak, he couldn't help but glance at Phoenix City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of surprise crossed Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed several Supreme Malevolence Airships taking off from the outskirts of Phoenix City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each airship was packed with at least ten thousand warriors from various races, all of them exuding immense power, each at least at the Celestial Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are tens of thousands of Celestial Deity soldiers preparing for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, hesitating to enter the divine peak as he watched dozens of Supreme Malevolence Airships ascend and swiftly depart from Phoenix City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their course was westward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown, thinking, "Westward?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These Dark Deity Legion forces are heading west? They must be using the Supreme Malevolence Airships for long-distance travel. Could their target be... the West Zone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened as realization dawned on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The strong forces of the Dark Deity Legion are gathering in the West Zone? Is the Paramount Supreme Clan about to launch an all-out war against the Human Community?"</span></p></div>
