        <h1>Chapter 27 He Won It</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The crowd exclaimed in astonishment. Osborne&rsquo;s bid of ten million dollars shocked Wesley and those big shots in Mayby City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That was ten million dollars, not one thousand dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even a wealthy family like the Caldwell family only had about 100 or 200 million dollars in cash, and most wealthy families would be reluctant to give out 10 million dollars for charity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Osborne, an ordinary person, calmly bid ten million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Clarissa, who was sitting at the front, couldn&rsquo;t help but turn her head slightly to glance at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was dumbfounded. His eyes were bloodshot, and he was utterly enraged. He immediately wanted to raise the bidding peddle to retort to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But suddenly, Ophelia stopped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She said, &ldquo;Wesley, forget it. In fact, Osborne extorted 20 million dollars from my family not long ago. It&rsquo;s too embarrassing, so I didn&rsquo;t tell you this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He has gone crazy. If you continue to pit against him, he will definitely spend all the 20 million dollars. I know you don&rsquo;t care about the money, but there&rsquo;s no need to do that for a worthless painting.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s words calmed Wesley down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had money, but was it really necessary to spend more than 20 million dollars to buy a useless painting just to surpass Osborne?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Many people would probably think he was a fool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After figuring it out, Wesley snorted coldly, &ldquo;Osborne, just wait and see. The crappy painting is yours. Only a fool like you would spend ten million dollars to buy such a painting.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, he sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered, &ldquo;You are really shameless. The way you admit defeat is unique. Loser.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Fuck you!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley clenched his fists angrily, but in the end, he suppressed his anger and dared not cause trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne got the painting for ten million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The charity auction continued, but the bidding was not as fierce as that of Osborne and Wesley. The highest price did not exceed two million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">An hour later, the charity auction ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone looked at Debbe with somewhat nervous expressions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Debbe would announce which lot Clarissa provided.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Who would win the chance to have lunch with Clarissa?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was looking forward to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia spent one million dollars to buy two items, and she was looking forward to the result.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Debbe finally spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Thank you all for your generosity and support for charity. Now, I announce that the mysterious item provided by Ms. Radcliffe is&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Wait a moment. I&rsquo;ll reveal it later.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Debbe aroused everyone&rsquo;s curiosity. Suddenly, she smiled and changed the topic. &ldquo;Before I announce the answer, I must explain some rules clearly now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The person who won Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s mysterious lot will have the opportunity to have lunch with her, but for her safety, she will decide the time and location. The person can only bring two friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You are welcome to put forward your views.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was impatient, but they dared not urge Debbe, so they could only respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;For Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s safety, it&rsquo;s necessary.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe even allows the person to bring two friends. She is so considerate.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Reveal the answer quickly.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Debbe nodded. &ldquo;Okay, then I won&rsquo;t waste your time. After all, there will be more intense treasure auctions next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Now, I declare that the mysterious lot offered by Ms. Radcliffe is&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Lot 15! A painting drawn by Ms. Radcliffe herself, <span style="font-style: italic;">That year, that person</span>!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next second, everyone in the venue was stunned. Those who had bid for paintings before all looked disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Those who had bid for paintings hurriedly to check whether the painting they had won was lot 15, but they were disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They looked up to see who the person was lucky to win lot 15.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia spent 600 thousand dollars and bought a painting. Unfortunately, it was not lot 15 but lot 16.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It disappointed her as if she had lost ten million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Some people whispered, &ldquo;Damn! I almost got it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Which lucky guy got lot 15?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia looked around with envy in her eyes. She wanted to know who got the opportunity she had always dreamed of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, after a while, no one stood out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The venue became even more noisy, and everyone was curious about the lucky winner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Osborne suddenly let out a soft exclamation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked down at the painting he had just received. On the box of the painting, there was a line of delicate handwriting - Lot 15. Painting. <span style="font-style: italic;">That year, that person</span>.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That person, that year?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lot 15?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was surprised. This seemingly ordinary children&rsquo;s painting in his hand turned out to be the mysterious lot provided by Clarissa!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa had held art exhibitions. How could this childish painting be her work?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked surprised, and his abnormal reaction attracted Wesley&rsquo;s attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley glanced casually, and then he was stunned, with disbelief in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How could it be you?&rdquo;</p></div>
