        <h1>Chapter 2278 Seclusion-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time whizzed by in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the depths of his seclusion, Osborne once again savored the perks of having a wise teacher. A single piece of advice had worked wonders, extricating him from a hopeless situation and paving the way for a new breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Osborne had got into the groove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The essence of his thunder power was seamlessly blending with his Sacred Power, becoming an integral part of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Turns out, merging powers isn't all that tough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I hadn't taken a wrong turn and squandered so much time, I might have integrated the thunder power into my Sacred Power long before the city duel started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I wouldn't have had to struggle so hard in the duel and could've emerged victorious with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but heave a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he attentively sensed the lightning power fusing into his Sacred Power, he was brimming with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, the words of Adriana popped into his mind, and Osborne quickly reined in his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is just the merger of the third power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There are still plenty of Supernal Deity Kings in this world who have combined four powers. Each subsequent fusion will only get trickier. It's far too early to rest on my laurels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Back to seclusion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The integration of the lightning energy went like a dream. Meanwhile, Osborne was also making leaps and bounds in other aspects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he knew it, he had finally reached Ascension Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, the Ninth Stage of the Ascension Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was over the moon. Without delay, he reached out with his senses to check on Alfreda's life essence. But his face soon fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no change in Alfreda's life essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still couldn't bring her back to life using it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've made it to the Ninth Stage of the Ascension Realm. So why can't I revive Alfreda? Could there be something amiss?" Osborne murmured, frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then called out, "Primordial!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial popped up in a flash, transforming into a tiny treant and hovering in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up? I'm in the middle of my seclusion, you know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne filled Primordial in on the situation. "Primordial, didn't you tell me I could revive Alfreda once I reached Ascension Eight, or better yet, Ascension Nine? Well, I'm already at Ascension Nine. So why can't I do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Primordial stroked its chin thoughtfully. "Maybe your strength still isn't up to par. Or perhaps we underestimated that old geezer from the Ethereal Elven Temple. He's no ordinary Empyrean Sacredness warrior. Even among those at that level, he's likely a heavy-hitter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't fret, though. As long as Alfreda's life essence remains intact, and your strength keeps growing, you'll surely bring Alfreda back one day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Ascension Nine isn't enough, then wait until you hit Ascension Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Ascension Ten doesn't cut it, you'll definitely be able to revive Alfreda once you reach the Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brows deeply. "I guess that's all I can do for now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he fixed his gaze on Primordial and asked, "Primordial, how's your strength these days? You've been holed up in my Soul Current Ocean for seclusion. I've noticed a significant boost in my soul power. Has your strength grown as well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Primordial wore a smug expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Soul Current Ocean is perfect for me! With the help of your Soul Current Ocean, my rate of improvement is very fast! Right now, I'm already comparable to an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King! Of course, I'm still not as good as you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial looked somewhat helpless.</span></p></div>
