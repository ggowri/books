        <h1>Chapter 2652 Slap Her Twice-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's expression remained calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing Osborne's mockery, he was not angry but rather delighted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket had appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had thought this plan was a complete failure, and he would never step into the Eighth Skyfall Casket again. However, the key appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was undoubtedly the best news for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Seraphina, Emiliano, and others he mistakenly killed, he didn't care at all. Even if they died unjustly, it didn't matter to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only thing he cared about was the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand over the key, and I might spare your life!" Frederick said again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne let out a cold laugh, thinking, "Sure enough, Frederick has completely turned into a ruthless person. Even with my mocking, he remains indifferent, caring only about the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Someone like him doesn't deserve to live."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "You want the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket? Dream on! If you dare make a move, I guarantee I'll throw the key into that black vortex immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That black vortex is raging wildly, even small Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors would be instantly crushed if they got close. I wonder if it can destroy this key?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if it can't be destroyed, you probably wouldn't dare to enter the black vortex to search for the key, would you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, Frederick's expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He warned harshly, "If you dare throw the key into the black vortex, I swear I'll torture you to death in the cruelest way! You will regret your choice!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered disdainfully, "Who are you trying to scare? If I can't live, why would I give you the key and let you benefit? Worst case, I'll enter the black vortex too. Torture me? Keep dreaming!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick fell silent upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glared at Osborne with a sinister gaze and gritted his teeth, asking, "What exactly do you want? Speak!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said calmly, "You want the key, and I want to survive. However, I don't trust you. If I hand over the key, you'll turn around and betray us, striking mercilessly. So, I won't be that foolish."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick said, "Then you can simply use the key yourself to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket. I don't know what's inside the Eighth Skyfall Casket, but once you enter it, I definitely won't be able to hunt you down anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, as long as you open and enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket, you'll be safe!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, what Frederick truly wanted was not the key itself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he craved was to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket and enter it, as it contained the power to greatly enhance his strength, possibly even breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the key itself, Frederick didn't really care much about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if it was an Imperial Artifact, he didn't mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, for him, as long as Osborne didn't destroy the key and was willing to use it to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket, that was enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh again after hearing this. "Open the Eighth Skyfall Casket? That would be too easy for you! Everyone knows you dream of entering the Skyfall Casket. Why should I help you? I think destroying the key is safer! Even if I die, I won't let you succeed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was instantly furious upon hearing this. "You'd rather die than open the Eighth Skyfall Casket, is that it? There's a huge secret hidden there. Once it's opened, everyone can enter and have a chance to skyrocket their strength!"</span></p></div>
