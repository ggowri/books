        <h1>Chapter 754 Losing Streak</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression was serious, but there was a flicker of excitement in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The power these two brought to the table was exhilarating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now this is what I'm talking about! The stronger the competition, the more thrilling it gets. Being top-tier is just the entry pass to this event. But if I could take all these elites down, crush them underfoot, that'd be something else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He licked his lips, eager to jump in and mix it up with these powerhouses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fight was heating up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay's main extra energy was manipulating light elemental, but his mastery went way beyond anyone Osborne had seen, like Aria and the others. He had complete control over the intermediate level, unleashing terrifying power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whether it was offense or defense, he had no weak spots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the flip side, Satoru was a dark elemental user, just as skilled with intermediate techniques. Their abilities were natural opposites, but they were so evenly matched that neither could gain an upper hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Light Realm!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dark Realm!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a heartbeat, both of them unleashed their Realms, causing the crowd to gasp in awe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A Realm! They're using Realms!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"These two have really mastered the advanced level, which was Realms! Hitting Class AAA and mastering a Realm is the key to breaking into the Godson Rankings!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Both of them might make it onto the list tomorrow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other fights on nearby stages had ground to a halt as everyone turned to watch this epic clash, their excitement palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was locked in, too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He'd seen Palmers use Dark Realm before, but compared to Satoru, she was way outclassed. After all, she was only at Class AA, while Satoru was at Class AAA.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satoru's Dark Realm was absolutely menacing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Clay's Light Realm was just as powerful. When the two Realms collided, the resulting force was immense, and both Realms dissolved at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A tie in the Realm showdown!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the Realms broke apart, both fighters looked pale, but neither backed down. They threw themselves back into the fight, going all out for another fifteen minutes. Even as they started to tire, neither could gain the upper hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, they broke apart, neither willing to continue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear they were too evenly matched. Unless one of them went all in, it was impossible to settle the score.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Satoru, you're seriously impressive for someone just thirty-two. You're definitely a future leader for Ransford."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay's face darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though their fight ended in a draw, his age made it feel like he'd lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satoru just smiled coolly. "A future leader? I wouldn't go that far. Ransford has tons of strong talents. I'm just one of many."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay snorted, not wanting to dwell on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He jumped off the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's settle this tomorrow! We'll see who makes it onto the Godson Rankings and who gets a better rank!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bring it on! Think I'll be scared of you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fight was over, but the crowd was buzzing with excitement, still reeling from the display of power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart stood there, wide-eyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow, so this is what it takes to aim for the Godson Rankings? They're all as strong as Rhett!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His earlier arrogance had faded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I used to laugh at Rhett for not making the list, thinking he was just weak. I figured once I hit Class AAA, I'd definitely make it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now I get it. It's not that Rhett was weak. It's just that everyone else is insanely strong!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivian couldn't help but laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now you get it? I told you, the experts out there aren't as easy as you thought. You really believed you'd be the best without seeing them firsthand?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Still aiming for the Godson Rankings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's mood sank for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But soon, he was back to his determined self. "Of course, I'm still going for it! Even if I don't make it this year, I'll keep trying next year and the year after. I know my talent is as good as anyone's. I'll get there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going to challenge myself and sharpen my skills right now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He declared and, with renewed determination, rushed onto the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who's up for a fight with me?" he called out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, someone stepped up to challenge him. Stuart fought hard, but after a dozen moves, he was knocked off the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His confidence took another hit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he didn't give up. He waited for another challenge and jumped back into the fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the next half day, Stuart climbed onto the stage six times, losing each match. His longest bout lasted fifteen minutes, almost ending in a draw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, he was defeated every time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The relentless defeats left Stuart feeling completely disheartened.</p></div>
