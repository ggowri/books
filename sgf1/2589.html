        <h1>Chapter 2480 Ambush-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign leads to the depths of the universe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe one day, I will also walk this path, venturing deeper into the universe to seek greater power and a higher cultivation level. But for now, in this Stellar Region of the Racial Convergence Planet, I still have too much to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I must find my parents in this life, pay respects to my mother from the past life, clear her name, and avenge her. Also, all the beatings, humiliation, and torment I suffered in my past life&mdash;I will take revenge for all of it. No one can stop me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter who you are now or how powerful you</span><span>'</span><span>ve become, I will find you. Just wait!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A</span><span> cold light flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial said, "Don't forget there's one more thing to do! I mentioned before that I can sense there</span><span>'</span><span>s still an offshoot of the World Tree on the Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Help me destroy it and let me absorb its Tree Heart energy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Don't worry, I haven't forgotten. Once we're strong enough, I'll help you collect the Tree Heart energy from other World Tree offshoots!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was satisfied with this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly changed his appearance, suppressing his aura and power as much as possible, preparing to find a place to return to Racial Convergence Planet to investigate clues about the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, Osborne suddenly felt Satan's Eye start to throb violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a danger warning!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was shocked. His Satan's Eye hadn't issued a danger warning in a long time, but every time it did, it meant danger was imminent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne barely hesitated, quickly took out the Warfare Shield, activated its defensive function, and used the dense Warfare Mist to protect himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he retreated as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, an incredibly terrifying force suddenly descended, instantly striking where he had just stood, completely obliterating it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne retreated in advance; otherwise, such a terrifying force would have torn his body apart instantly. Even though he avoided the center of the attack, the aftermath alone shattered all the surrounding Warfare Mist, and Osborne's body was violently flung away. He clearly heard the sound of his bones breaking and his organs rupturing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cold sweat poured down Osborne's forehead. Ignoring the intense pain, he quickly looked in one direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There, an old man suddenly appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man's eyes were filled with icy killing intent, staring at Osborne as if looking at a dead man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne recognized the old man's identity, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the old man, seeing that he hadn't immediately killed Osborne, showed a hint of surprise on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved his hand, and Osborne instantly felt a thick energy enveloping him, as if a cage had trapped him inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly tried, but found he couldn't leave through interdimensional travel, and his face immediately turned extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm doomed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the old man sneered and said, "Not bad! You actually sensed and dodged my sneak attack in advance. It seems the secrets you carry are far more than I imagined. Unfortunately, you made a fatal mistake, and today will be your end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand over your Kingdom Duel Badge obediently! Surrender all the treasures and secrets you have! Oh, and the Ice Scepter doesn't belong to you. You can return it to me as well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, I can let you die a little easier!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the old man finished speaking, Osborne's expression changed drastically. "Are you from Skyearth Dominion?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man no longer hid it and calmly replied, "That's right! I am the deputy leader of Skyearth Dominion, Aaron Wagner. Brenda is my disciple. The Ice Scepter was a gift from me to her. I thought she would win the championship, but she was suppressed by you and didn't even make it to the top three. What a useless fool."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Still, no matter how useless Brenda is, she is my disciple. You took her Ice Scepter, so you must die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Aaron unleashed overwhelming killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Now, hand it over immediately, and then you can die!"</span></p></div>
