        <h1>Chapter 1627 Discovery</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Riley's divine power essence shattered, he was rendered utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even as a mid-stage Deity Overlord, he couldn't withstand Osborne's transformation. No matter how much he shouted and struggled, he ultimately found himself submitting before Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Greetings, my Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, allowing the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to intertwine with Riley's body, initiating the healing process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moments later, Riley's injuries were fully mended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Throughout the entire ordeal, Diana stood in stunned silence, her mouth agape. Osborne's incredible abilities left her in awe, and she struggled to comprehend the depth of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley said, his tone shifting to a more serious note, "My Lord, Emmett's death could stir up some trouble. He was part of the Huntington family, which ranks among the top three in the Soaring Lion Clan. They have more than one Deity King warrior in their ranks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne remained calm, dismissing the concern with a wave of his hand. "Don't worry about it. The Huntington family won't have any solid evidence against us. We'll stick to one story&mdash;Emmett was killed by Deathborn. They won't dare to come after us openly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley nodded, "I'll handle it. I'll make sure it doesn't come back to you, my Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne turned his attention to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you don't need to mine Essence Crystals anymore. You have great talent, but your level is still a bit low. With five days left in this mission, focus on your training here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you mean, don't mine Essence Crystals? I can't just stop! I need to collect enough to report back. If I don't, there will be consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Other people might get away with it, but as a member of the Human Community, I'll face serious punishment if I can't deliver!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled gently, "Don't worry. I'll ensure you have enough Essence Crystals to fulfill your mission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he focused his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Activating Satan's Eye, Osborne pinpointed an Ultimate Essence Crystal embedded deep within a hard rock. A faint ripple of spatial energy surged, and in the blink of an eye, the Essence Crystal vanished into his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne reached into his space and pulled out the shimmering crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Here's enough Ultimate Essence Crystals for you! Take this for your training, and when we head back, I'll make sure you have plenty to complete your task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll have Riley and the others keep an eye on you, waking you periodically to ensure you don't slip into a hallucination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I hope you can reach the peak of Celestial Deity soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's jaw dropped in disbelief as she stared at the Ultimate Essence Crystal in Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She mused, "How does he have enough of these?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I remember Osborne just arrived at Divine Peak Nine yesterday. This is his first time in the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could he possibly have Ultimate Essence Crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she held her tongue. The secrets surrounding Osborne were far too numerous, like an abyss that was impossible to fully see into.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sometimes, ignorance was bliss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, Diana nodded vigorously. "Alright! I'll follow your plan! My soul power is quite strong, and I'm not easily affected by illusions. I just needed enough time and Ultimate Essence Crystals to train. I can break through to the peak of Celestial Deity in just one day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Confidence radiated from Diana's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Great! I can't wait to see it!" Osborne replied, pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Diana began her training. Osborne issued orders to Riley and the others to protect her and monitor her progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once everything was set, he turned his attention to his own plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's immediate task was to find a location with the highest concentration of spiritual energy in the area. He needed to transfer his Infinite Devouring Eyes from the No. 9 mining area to a spot rich in heavenly energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Deep within No. 53 mine, the vitality of the world surged vibrantly around him. Here, the celestial energy was ten times denser than in the No. 9 mining area and a staggering thousand times more concentrated than in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he could establish his Infinite Devouring Eyes here, Osborne's cultivation speed would surpass that of anyone using Ultimate Essence Crystals, increasing by dozens of times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, despite this prime location, he felt a lingering dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sensed, almost instinctively, that further to the east, the spiritual energy thrummed even more powerfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Theoretically, the most abundant energy should be above Divine Peak Nine. But that place is too treacherous. I don't understand the situation there well enough to take that gamble right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, for now, I must settle for a spot below Divine Peak Nine. As a floating mountain, Divine Peak Nine spans millions of miles! I'm currently on the outer edge; I need to move further east, toward the center, and find a safe spot with robust energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this search, I'll also gather as many Ultimate Essence Crystals as I can..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his plan set, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He harnessed his spatial power, slipping seamlessly into a parallel dimension. The once-impenetrable rocks became mere shadows, unable to hinder his swift exploration eastward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whenever he detected an Ultimate Essence Crystal, Osborne effortlessly snatched it and stored it in his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he delved deeper into the mine, the yield of Ultimate Essence Crystals increased significantly.</span></p></div>
