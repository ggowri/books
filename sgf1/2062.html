        <h1>Chapter 2054 Elf Water-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced down at the elf named Alfreda, who looked remarkably youthful, almost like a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, her presence was anything but childlike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, which hinted at her considerable age and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her overly enthusiastic greeting made Osborne feel a bit awkward, as if he were on the receiving end of an exuberant welcome that was perhaps a bit too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What puzzled him even more was the sight of the Elf Tree, dotted with numerous vacant treehouses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It raised a red flag in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there something off about this place? Could it be a scam?" he thought, furrowing his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye, scanning the surroundings for any lurking threats. Once he confirmed that no one was lying in wait, he let out a quiet sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning back to the elf, he decided it was best to get to the bottom of why the place felt so deserted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there was indeed something amiss, he would be in a heap of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearing his throat, Osborne asked, "So, are you the owner here? It seems... a bit desolate. Why isn't anyone renting these treehouses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Alfreda's expression dimmed. "That's because I belong to the Nature Elf Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, puzzled, "The Nature Elf Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, but I'm not familiar with that. This is my first time in Elf City, and I don't know much about it. If you can't explain it clearly, I'm afraid I can't rent from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's face fell further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sigh, she said, "Well, since there are no guests right now, I might as well tell you. I wouldn't want you to think I'm trying to pull a fast one on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned and walked into one of the treehouses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on in! I'll pour you a cup of Elf Water. Don't worry, I won't harm you! We Nature Elves never strike first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but decided to follow her inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The interior of the treehouse was simple yet charming, with furniture carved from the very trunks of the Elf Trees. It wasn't extravagant, but it had a rustic elegance that made him feel as if he were nestled in the heart of a forest, bringing an undeniable sense of calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda waved her hand, and a stump appeared before Osborne. "Take a seat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then grabbed a wooden cup, and with another wave, a branch descended, dripping a crystal-clear liquid that exuded a delicate fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cup quickly filled, and she brought it over to him, settling onto a stump across from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She propped her hand beneath her chin, her gaze tinged with wistfulness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda said, "Drink up! Since it's your first time in Elf City, you've probably never tasted Elf Water. This is the nectar of the Elf Trees! If business were better, you might not even get a chance to try it! Go on, give it a shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held the cup, pausing before taking a sip. In his mind, he quickly reached out to Primordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial, this Elf Water isn't poisoned, is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not! It's a delicacy! This Nature Elf isn't deceiving you. This is a rare treasure from the Elf Trees. Just this one cup is worth at least ten Celestial Crystals!" Primordial replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, thinking, "What?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten Celestial Crystals for a single cup of Elf Water?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is the same amount I'll need to rent the cheapest treehouse for an entire year!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Alfreda, his expression a mix of surprise and curiosity. But he held his tongue, lifting the cup to his lips and taking a cautious sip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne took a sip, an exquisite fragrance exploded in Osborne's mouth, making him feel as if every pore in his body opened up in pure delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed a slight enhancement in his physical strength&mdash;just a tiny bit, but enough to leave him astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering his body had already reached the level of an Infinite Sacred Body, any improvement, no matter how small, was nothing short of miraculous.</span></p></div>
