        <h1>Chapter 2140 Sheer Might of an Empyrean Sacredness Warrior</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a fragment of soul power, and it can be this strong?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes went wide with shock. His defenses were formidable&mdash;capable of withstanding even Uriel and Alfreda&mdash;but this specter, a fragment of Isidore, had shattered everything in an insane display of power, almost tearing his body apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer might of an Empyrean Sacredness warrior was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Isidore unleashed a similar attack again, it wouldn't just mean Osborne's end; Alfreda would be finished too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce determination flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was completely fused with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and possessed immortality, there was no room for error now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Isidore was an Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he died at the hands of Isidore, he couldn't be sure if his resurrection ability would still work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The likes of Isidore could very well have the means to ensure his death was permanent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stakes were just too high to gamble on that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you okay?" Alfreda's voice broke through the storm of his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was cradled in his arms, unharmed but sensing his distress. Her beautiful face wore a mask of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, not dead yet!" he snapped back, the urgency of their situation firing up his mind as he sought a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, you're still alive?" Isidore's voice dripped with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he hadn't expected Osborne to withstand such a direct hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting. Although I'm merely a fragment of a soul right now and can't exert my full strength, even warriors at Ascension Seven, Eight, or even Nine wouldn't survive an encounter with me!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just an Ascension Three warrior, and yet you managed to block my attack&mdash;impressive! It just makes me want to kill you even more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Isidore finished, the palpable tension increased as Osborne felt another surge of malevolent energy, stronger than before, bearing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pit of his stomach dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This one he couldn't block or evade!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's complexion hardened dramatically. Previously, with the protection of the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Armor and Eclipse War Armor, he had weathered Isidore's attack, but now, those defenses lay in ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing a ramped-up assault from Isidore, he knew he would not survive a direct hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to act, and fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolute defense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resounding hum, Osborne's form began to shift and swell, morphing into a colossal crimson lotus&mdash;his first transformation since fully merging with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this crimson lotus form, he could harness the immense power granted by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolute defense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he wrapped Alfreda in the protective embrace of his lotus petals, shielding her entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the looming attack came crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was deafening, as the devastating force struck the crimson lotus, resulting in a violent explosion. But as the dust settled, the lotus stood unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the beauty of absolute defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne assumed the second form of the crimson lotus, his defensive capabilities soared to extraordinary heights. At this point, the fact that it was merely Isidore's soul launching an attack was inconsequential. Even if Isidore were present in his physical form, he'd stand no chance of inflicting the slightest damage on Osborne in his crimson lotus state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne was an impregnable fortress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore exhaled in disbelief, staring wide-eyed at the enormous crimson lotus that was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not from the Human Community?! A crimson lotus? Such a powerful defense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore's brow furrowed deeply as he regarded Osborne's transformation with keen curiosity, pausing his assault to study the unusual power before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath the protective petals of the lotus, Alfreda stared at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Osborne is not a human?! How did he suddenly transform into a crimson lotus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could sense that this was no mere shapeshifting; it was Osborne's true form!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to her, this was actually his second form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, didn't respond to Isidore or Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had taken on the crimson lotus form with its impenetrable defenses, he was now rooted in place, unable to move or escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic clawed at him as he desperately searched for a way to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With absolute defense active, Isidore can't kill me. But I can't fight back either... And I'm not the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity; I can't maintain this form forever. Every second drains my energy! Once I run out of power, I'll have to face Isidore again, and I won't stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed deeply, the weight of the moment pressing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in the most perilous situation of his life, and he needed to come up with a solution fast. If Osborne didn't find a way to deal with Isidore, both he and Alfreda would perish here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't afford to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, countless people were waiting for his return. He had too much left to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can I do to take down Isidore? He's too powerful&mdash;a true Empyrean Sacredness warrior, strong beyond imagination! Even a mere fragment of his soul is comparable to an Ascension Eight or even Nine Supernal Deity King. Right now, I'm no match for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even the absolute forbidden zone will work against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow pose a threat to Isidore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated, weighing the option of dropping the crimson lotus form to unleash the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow against Isidore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bow had been reinforced with thousands of </span><span>Azure</span><span> Ores; while it wasn't quite a Sacred Artifact, it was one of the most powerful Apex divine artifacts in this cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he unleashed its full might, he might have a fighting chance to injure Isidore's fragment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what if he miscalculated?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That could spell disaster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I take the risk?" Anxiety gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maintaining the crimson lotus form was draining his strength rapidly. If he continued like this, he'd become too weak to confront Isidore at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a thought struck him. Osborne mused, "What if I could tap into the power of Umbra Earth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Umbra Earth realm only allows those under three hundred years old to enter! Isidore is over ten thousand years old! He shouldn't be able to enter this world at all! If he steps inside, he'll be struck down by the terrifying lightning in the skies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it's just a fragment of his soul, it should still be repelled and attacked by the Umbra Earth's lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But strangely, the lightning hasn't attacked Isidore yet. It is clear he is using some special means to conceal his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Umbra Earth lightning can't sense him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if I could lure the lightning to strike at Isidore? If I can draw that lightning down, he won't be able to hide anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the Umbra Earth lightning locks onto his soul, it will obliterate him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can take out Isidore's fragment, Alfreda and I will be safe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Sacred Artifact-level palace will be mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With excitement coursing through him, Osborne's eyes sparkled with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's it! This is how I'll do it!"</span></p></div>
