        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She continued walking toward the center of the arena, coldly staring at Osborne. "I told you I would break your legs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before, I didn't face you, so you made it to the top five. If you'd met me earlier, you'd have been eliminated long ago. But now, it's not too late!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've decided. Not only will I break your legs, but I'll also seriously injure you so you can't participate in the upcoming ranking battles. Fifth place is all you're worthy of!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina's expression was full of arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile, the arrogance of the Royal Family member fully revealed at this moment. She not only wanted to severely harm Osborne but also directly voiced her thoughts to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since that's the case, Osborne wouldn't show mercy either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded. "Your idea is great. Coincidentally, I have the same thought. Your legs are fine, so the sound of them breaking must be delightful. Since you're so proud, it would be quite interesting if you don't even make it into the top three in the end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, the crowd watching let out gasps, stunned by Osborne's remark.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he just said was similar to Seraphina's meaning. But they weren't surprised that Seraphina would say such things because her status and strength were both formidable. So, they believed Seraphina's words stemmed from confidence and arrogance, and she had the right to say so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, if a Royal Family princess said such things to an ordinary person, who would be surprised?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne, an ordinary person, said such things to a princess. He wanted to break Seraphina's legs, even injure her severely so she couldn't make it into the top three.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words were truly shocking!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least before this, no ordinary person had ever said such things to a Royal Family prince or princess, not even in the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman said in shock, "Isn't Osborne afraid of death?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although this is the arena, where strength speaks, Princess Seraphina is still a Royal Family princess. He said in front of almost all the Royal Family members that he would break Princess Seraphina's legs. Isn't he afraid of being resented and retaliated against by the Royal Family?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man said helplessly, "The Royal Family won't do anything to him in the arena, but he can't stay there forever. Once he leaves, he won't be able to withstand the Royal Family's retaliation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some people think Osborne must be crazy to talk to Seraphina like that. If any Royal Family member present gets upset and decides to retaliate, Osborne is doomed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this is bound to happen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, on the viewing platform where the Royal Family members were seated, they were staring coldly at Osborne, their expressions extremely grim. It was obvious they were already angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They will definitely find a chance to retaliate against Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone said, "He's doomed! Even if Princess Seraphina doesn't kill him, once he leaves the arena, he's definitely dead because the Royal Family will never let him go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another person said, "The Royal Family has a hundred ways to kill him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Listening to everyone's discussions, Osborne smiled faintly and thought, "Will I anger the Royal Family? Will the Royal Family retaliate against me? So what? After I come out of Necropolis City, even if the Royal Family doesn't trouble me, I'll retaliate against the Royal Family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Very well!" Seraphina sneered, looking at Osborne as if she were looking at a dead man. "It's the first time I've met someone as arrogant as you. Then let me see if you really have the strength to break my legs."</span></p></div>
