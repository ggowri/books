        <h1>Chapter 1344 Harvest</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's sudden appearance didn't faze Apocalypse Harbinger in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had anticipated this move, after all. As a skilled commander, he understood that if he were in Osborne's position, he would make the same choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Capturing the leader first wasn't surprising at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without sparing a glance at Osborne, he continued directing the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had gained the upper hand, and he felt that this victory was solely due to his expertise in leadership. Now was the time to seize the opportunity and crush the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were defeated, Osborne would be nothing more than a sitting duck, easily dispatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Osborne's attempt at stealth, he had twenty elite Transcendent Deity warriors surrounding him, perfectly equipped for defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger had no doubt they could handle any threat Osborne posed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't believe for a second that Osborne could break through their defenses and reach him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it wasn't long before he regretted his assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's attack exceeded anything he had anticipated, instantly enveloping him and his twenty adept protectors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors immediately unleashed their divine power to form a protective barrier around Apocalypse Harbinger, desperate to shield him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to their horror, they soon discovered that Osborne's might far surpassed their defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's assault was terrifying, and the divine barrier felt as fragile as glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One hit was all it took. The overwhelming force surged forth, consuming their bodies in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Esteemed Apocalypse Harbinger, get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twenty Transcendent Deity warriors screamed in panic, but their bodies were engulfed by Osborne's relentless attack. They felt their Divine Bodies shatter, bursting into a gruesome cloud of blood mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there was Apocalypse Harbinger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he meticulously orchestrated the battlefield, the shouts of his guards broke through his concentration. He hesitated for a split second, and then a chill crept down his spine, his senses screaming of impending danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whirling around, Apocalypse Harbinger caught sight of Osborne's devastating blow tearing through his twenty personal guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger was frozen, his body rigid with shock. Any hope of dodging </span><span>now was futile; Osborne's formidable attack crashed over him like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barely had time to utter a protest before his form was engulfed in the same brutal onslaught that had annihilated his protectors. His Divine Body fractured and crumbled, dissolving into a cloud of blood mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne was taken aback. Having borrowed a third of the Blood Demon members' strength pushed him to the peak of the Superior Deity level, and yet he had single-handedly wiped out twenty elite Transcendent Deity warriors along with Apocalypse Harbinger himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't even needed a second blow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he watched the body of Apocalypse Harbinger explode into a fine mist, a cold smile spread across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The tide of battle has begun to turn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he shifted his gaze to the remaining Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they heard Apocalypse Harbinger's desperate cries and witnessed their commander fall alongside his elite </span><span>guards,</span><span> shock rippled through their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos ignited within the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just about losing their commander; they were paralyzed by fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The display of power from Osborne was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One strike to obliterate over twenty Transcendent Deity warriors?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't have many more than a hundred and fifty in total!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had just eliminated one-seventh of their forces with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a scenario, could they really emerge victorious in this war? Even if they were to neutralize the Blood Demon members, Osborne, with his formidable prowess, would undoubtedly remain unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse yet, they would be hunted down by Osborne himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tactics were so uncanny; could they even evade his grasp?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Apocalypse Harbinger, Emperor Dare, and Eliot all felled by Osborne, the mere thought of avoiding his assassination seemed impossible. How, then, could they possibly withstand his onslaught?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, panic enveloped the tripartite alliance, their unity fracturing under the weight of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This psychological turmoil significantly hampered their combat effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was precisely at this moment that the Blood Demon members seized their chance for retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne returned their strength, they pounced on the chaos, splitting and surrounding the enemy ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Apocalypse Harbinger's demise, Osborne's true killing spree began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armed with the Goddess of Grain's scythe, he morphed into a spectral figure of darkness, bringing death wherever he appeared. His targets were the Transcendent Deity warriors of the tripartite alliance, while he paid no heed to any Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him, even the Transcendent Deity warriors were no match for a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The presence of Blood Demon members ensured the enemies couldn't regroup </span><span>effectively to counter Osborne's slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tally of his slain foes continued to mount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wielded the Goddess of Grain's scythe with deadly precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combining the scythe with Temporal Stasis, Phantom Steps, Medusa's Gaze, and other formidable techniques, he swiftly harvested the lives of the Transcendent Deity warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None could stand in his way.</span></p></div>
