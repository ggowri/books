        <h1>Chapter 91 Revealing Identity</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Early the next morning, Osborne tidied up and drove to the Radcliffe Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, get ready quickly. We&rsquo;re waiting for you,&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Deputy Captain Violet waved toward Osborne anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was surprised to see Violet and the entire fourth Bodyguard Unit fully armed and ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Violet&rsquo;s gear, Osborne was stunned. She had all sorts of Draco equipment:</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">- Draco DS automatic pistol</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">- Draco DB automatic rifle</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">- Draco DJ precision sniper rifle</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">- Two Draco DL directional mines</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">- Five Draco DSL grenades (offensive, smoke, and flashbangs)</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">- Draco DD alloy dagger</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">- Draco DW friend-or-foe ID system</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">- Draco DF reconnaissance drone</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">- Draco DT bulletproof helmet</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">- Draco DF digital bulletproof vest</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">- Draco DM full-vision gas mask</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">- Draco DBB tactical backpack</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">- &hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was stunned as he looked at Violet and the members of the fourth Bodyguard Unit behind her. He even saw someone equipped with a personal grenade launcher and a rocket launcher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was completely flabbergasted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their individual gear, all manufactured by the Draco Group, was classified as D-level tactical equipment. Although only D-level, it was worth at least a million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Are you going to war or something?&rdquo; Osborne thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Smith, what are you going to do? Do we have a mission? I haven&rsquo;t heard about any wars breaking out.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet smiled slightly. &ldquo;No wars, but we do have a mission. Ms. Radcliffe is leaving the manor to visit Skyefall Security Services for some discussions. Skyefall Security Services is outside the city, and the route is quite remote. We need to ensure her security.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s expression changed slightly at her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He moved closer to Violet and asked in a low voice, &ldquo;Ms. Smith, you work for Skyefall Security Services, right? Do you know why Ms. Radcliffe is visiting Skyefall Security Services?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet hesitated for a moment and then whispered, &ldquo;I heard from the higher-ups that the Draco Group is considering splitting off its security division. Skyefall Security Services might be up for sale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe heard about it and, on Captain Paul&rsquo;s recommendation, wants to check out Skyefall Security Services to see if she can buy it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, &ldquo;Godfather is selling Skyefall Security Services? Why?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Skyefall Security Services was the top security company in Skyefall, with thousands of professional bodyguards serving the city&rsquo;s elite families, generating over a billion dollars in profit annually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Such a security company might not be crucial to Godfather, but it was still a valuable asset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn&rsquo;t figure out why Godfather would want to sell Skyefall Security Services.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shook his head. He didn&rsquo;t understand Godfather&rsquo;s reasoning and didn&rsquo;t care to figure it out. He focused on a critical point in Violet&rsquo;s words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul suggested that Clarissa visit Skyefall Security Services.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Could it be that Paul and the Aberrants plan to attack Clarissa on the way?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne frowned at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought it was very likely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, hurry up and get ready. We&rsquo;re about to leave. Our equipment is company-issued, so we can&rsquo;t give you any. But the Radcliffe family has prepared a bulletproof vest for you. It&rsquo;s almost as good as the Draco Group&rsquo;s D-level vests. Go put it on,&rdquo; Violet urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shook his head and lifted his coat, revealing his own gear. &ldquo;Ms. Smith, I don&rsquo;t need it. I have my own bulletproof vest.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet glanced at it and was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The Draco Group&rsquo;s B-level defensive soft armor? How is that possible? How did you get this level of defensive gear?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As an elite bodyguard of Skyefall Security Services, she only wore a D-level bulletproof vest and used D-level weapons. Only the upper echelon of Skyefall Security Services had access to C-level defensive equipment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">None of them had the authority for B-level gear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Draco Group strictly controlled C-level and above equipment due to its high cost, making it inaccessible without proper authorization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was puzzled as to how Osborne had such equipment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Violet&rsquo;s surprise, Osborne smiled and showed his Draco Star Wristlet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet&rsquo;s eyes widened in astonishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You&hellip; you&rsquo;re&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne gestured for her to keep quiet. &ldquo;Ms. Smith, I don&rsquo;t want to reveal my identity yet. Please keep this to yourself.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet, utterly shocked, nodded vigorously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But her attitude towards Osborne changed, becoming extremely respectful. &ldquo;Osborne, I never imagined you were a confidant of Godfather, a holder of the Draco Star Wristlet. If you need anything in the future, just ask. I&rsquo;ll cooperate fully.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled at her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had revealed his identity to Violet, hoping for her assistance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With Paul and the Aberrants planning a large-scale attack on Clarissa, it would be challenging to stop them alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He needed more help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The third and fourth Bodyguard Units protecting Clarissa were from Skyefall Security Services, a Godfather enterprise. By revealing his identity, he could win them over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Smith, we might face a tough battle today.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne quickly informed Violet about Paul being an insider for the Aberrants and their plan to attack Clarissa today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet&rsquo;s face turned serious and surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she didn&rsquo;t doubt him and said seriously, &ldquo;Tell us how to cooperate with you. The entire fourth Bodyguard Unit and Sharon&rsquo;s third Bodyguard Unit will follow your lead.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled at her response.</p></div>
