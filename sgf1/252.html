        <h1>Chapter 252 The Powerful Witch</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't say I wanted to sleep with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said helplessly, but Isa sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't explain. Aren't all men </span><span>tend</span><span> to think sexually? I am so beautiful. Dare you to say that you have never thought of sleeping with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If not, I'd have to question whether you're a man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes and didn't bother to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to let Isa think whatever she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's room was in the backyard. Outside the room was a vast yard, which was enough for the two of them to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe retreated to a distance at this time, clenched her fists, and she looked anticipated and nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe shouted loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Isa glared over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe quickly stuck out her tongue and said, "Ms. Bowin, come on! But you can't be too hard or hurt my Osborne, or I'll be sad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You only care about him? Don't you care about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said unhappily, "It's a waste of time to teach you as my disciple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed and said, "Zoe is my sister, she naturally loves me. But Zoe, you are wrong. You shouldn't worry about her hurting me, you should worry about me hurting her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe smiled slightly and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled and said, "Don't you even take me seriously now? Do you even want to hurt me? Today, I will let you know how powerful I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she finished speaking, Isa moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stomped her long legs on the ground, and her body rushed out like an arrow. Her explosive power was so terrifying and her speed was so fast that Osborne could hardly react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed, and he quickly focused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was very strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, Osborne still had no idea where her limits were. Isa always defeated her opponent with just a random kick or punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne was confident, he would not be careless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Satan's Eye, open!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened Satan's Eye and immediately saw Isa's movements clearly. At this time, Isa had already arrived in front of him, with her shoulders slightly lowered, as if </span><span>she was about to punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, and he immediately reacted, ready to strike first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, his expression changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he discovered that it was just a fake move by Isa. She was not going to punch but to kick. She kicked his chest hard. The speed was so fast that even with Satan's Eye, he could only see a shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't avoid it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made a judgment instantly, but he did not panic. He instantly activated the Devil's Light in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blue Devil's Light enveloped Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a loud sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa kicked Osborne in the chest, but Osborne didn't move at all. However, Isa stepped back with a look of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at the blue Devil's Light, extremely surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder you are so confident, what kind of power is this? It's such a strong defense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the power of the level five Devil's Light and looked more confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you scared now? I told </span><span>you,</span><span> I can defeat you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sneered and said, "Do you really think you won? Just now it wasn't even a warm-up, I was just afraid of hurting you. Now I have to be a little more serious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Isa took action again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her figure flashed, and in the blink of an eye, she appeared in front of Osborne again, punching and kicking Osborne. Osborne wanted to fight back but found that even with the help of Satan's Eye, he was completely unable to capture Isa's motive for attacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his counterattacks were in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all of Isa's attacks hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne didn't have the level five Devil's Light to protect his body, he would have been bruised by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Turtle shell? Is it useful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sneered again, and her strength suddenly increased again. Moreover, in each move, there was a strange spiral force, like an electric drill. The force penetrated the defense of the level five Devil's Light and was transmitted to Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne groaned and was slightly injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although such a minor injury did not cause any impact on Osborne's vital body and he recovered instantly, Osborne was still extremely shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of strength is this? Why can it penetrate my defense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled faintly and said, "I told you a long time ago, don't underestimate martial artists! Martial artists are not just reckless men with strong physical fitness. In terms of skills, you are not even an entry-level martial artist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your trick is indeed very powerful, but I have many ways to bypass it and directly injure your body! The move just now is called Spiral Force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, try this trick again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deadly Force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Isa punched the green Devil's Light fiercely. The Devil's Light did not move at all, as if it had not been attacked, but Osborne's chest seemed to be hit by a train, and he flew backwards with a muffled groan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was blood at the corner of his mouth, and he looked shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deadly Force?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa clapped her hands and said calmly, "Do you want to continue fighting? Your improvement is indeed great, but if you want to beat me, you're dreaming. Because </span><span>your</span><span> fighting skills are too poor, you can only rely on the power to crush me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay if you meet an ordinary opponent, but if you meet a real master, you will lose miserably!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned and the Devil's Light dissipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I surrender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne looked at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, you have to teach me!"</span></p></div>
