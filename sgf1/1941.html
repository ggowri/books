        <h1>Chapter 1940 Back</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when the Shadow Terror Fiend completely vanished did Icy Nine finally let out a breath of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he glanced around, his heart sank. Out of the more than fifty Paramount Supreme Clan's Supernal Deity Kings he had brought, barely over twenty remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than half had fallen to the merciless onslaught of the Shadow Terror Fiend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those lost were an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King and six Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly pierced Icy Nine's heart was Osric's death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osric was a life power wielder, a rare breed among Supernal Deity Kings, and even more so an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the entire Paramount Supreme Clan, life power users were treasures&mdash;few and far between, each one fiercely protected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone understood the invaluable role Supernal Deity Kings of life power played on the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a life power user present, it meant that countless lives could be saved. Injuries could be healed as long as one didn't get instantly killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osric's presence was the only reason Icy Nine felt bold enough to provoke the Shadow Terror Fiend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osric was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine's vision blurred with tears as dread settled in. How could he possibly explain this to Lord Malevolence? Yet, there was no time for that now&mdash;the first priority was to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could tell if the Shadow Terror Fiend would have second thoughts. If he chose to disregard Lord Malevolence's authority, they would all be doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gather yourselves quickly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to leave right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is all on me. I'll take full responsibility for what happened! Let's move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defeated, Icy Nine waved his hand and led the remaining warriors to retreat in haste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All around them lay the remnants of battle&mdash;a stark reminder of the horror that had just unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once chaotic battleground fell eerily silent. After what felt like an eternity, a faint ripple in the air signaled the arrival of a new presence&mdash;Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had initially struck Osric with a surprise attack, severely wounding him, only to scurry away and hide in a parallel space tens of thousands of miles away. There, he kept a watchful eye on the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tense expression settled on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The Shadow Terror Fiend is indeed formidable! Without Osric's help, Icy Nine stood no chance against him. </span><span>Among o</span><span>ver fifty Supernal Deity Kings</span><span>,</span><span> nearly thirty of them were slaughtered in no time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's terrifying, and this isn't even the true form of the Shadow Terror Fiend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's crazier is that he seems to have an alliance with Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of partnership could that be? It makes sense now why even the Shadow Terror Fiend is cautious around Lord Malevolence. He wouldn't have spared Icy Nine otherwise..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of that mattered to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those warriors had just perished, and their memories were still fresh. He needed to act quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately set to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the thirty fallen Paramount Supreme Clan Supernal Deity Kings, their belongings had been taken by Icy Nine, but their memories remained untouched, lingering in the air like echoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was what Osborne sought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, Mila, and the others are already at or near the pinnacle of Deity King level. They just need to unlock their Divine Bodies and understand the Divine Ascendance Technique before they can break through to the Supernal Deity King level! However, their rapid advancement leaves them lacking in experience. If I could gather the memories of these Paramount Supreme Clan's Supernal Deity Kings, it would fill in those gaps! I must take all these memories with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne harnessed the power of memory bestowed upon him by Satan's Eye. With it fully activated, he quickly identified and sealed the lingering memories around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a shame! Nearly ten Supernal Deity Kings' memories have already faded. Still, this will have to do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a rush of relief. The memories that Seven Young Deity Kings needed were intact. "Now, it's time to make my exit..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a chill crept down his spine, a deep-seated fear clawing at his heart. Instinctively, he activated his spatial power to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the next heartbeat, Osborne felt a hand on his shoulder, pinning him in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced as he turned to see the Shadow Terror Fiend standing behind Osborne, a mocking smile playing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, if it isn't you again." The Shadow Terror Fiend's voice dripped with icy disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of dread wash over him, his body tensing reflexively to strike back. But as he recalled the fiend's overwhelming power, he forced himself to rein in his instincts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh, excuse me, but have we met before?" Osborne stammered, trying to maintain his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend laughed coldly. "Playing dumb? Not long ago, you were spying on me outside Divine Peak Nine in the East Zone. I caught you in the act, remember?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath hitched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He certainly hadn't forgotten that encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the Creator Deity?!" he exclaimed, memories flooding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind raced back to that moment when his Satan's Eye had just reached Level Ten. Osborne had peered deep into the core of Divine Peak Nine, spotting the enormous humanoid statue at its center, entwined with massive roots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, his eye had locked onto the statue's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous voice had echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare to spy on a Creator Deity with your ant-like body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll remember you, pest. Should you ascend the Stairway of Ascension, I'll take your life! Now, begone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of that voice still haunted him, causing blood to pour from his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a single glance had nearly shattered his divine power essence, elemental essence, and Divine Body, not to mention the turmoil it had caused in his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the Creator Deity? Every statue on the divine peaks is you?" Osborne's mind spun in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend's smile widened, a glint of amusement in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you did spy on me! I'm curious. How did you manage that? There are special powers obscuring sight on my divine peak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend fixed his gaze on Osborne, but he found nothing revealing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not the Creator Deity. To be precise</span><span>, I'm merely a fragment of consciousness discarded by the Creator Deity. You can call me the Creation Herald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne struggled to suppress his shock. "So, it's the Creation Herald, then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald's smile turned sinister. "I had every intention of ending you right here. Your eyes gave me a bad feeling, especially since you managed to catch a glimpse of me! But you helped me out by severely wounding that Ascension Three Supernal Deity King using life power. I'm not one to be ungrateful, so I'll let you live."</span></p></div>
