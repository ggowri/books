        <h1>Chapter 1775 The Arrival</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A multitude of Malevolence Airships floated in the vicinity of the colossal arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, there were at least tens of thousands of Ultimate Malevolence Airships, tightly packed and surrounding the arena, dispersing the surrounding mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far off, several exquisitely crafted Supreme Malevolence Airships glimmered in the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On each airship, figures crowded the decks, all eyes fixed on the arena, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the "Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the forefront, a powerful group had gathered, and their presence was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all at least Deity Kings, numbering over a thousand, with many appearing remarkably youthful and brimming with confidence and battle intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them hailed from the top ten Upper Races. They were Thunderstorm Drake Clan, Thunder Serpents Clan, Snow Fox Clan, Demonic Dragon Clan, Soaring Lion Clan, Raging Elephant Clan, Glory Eagle Clan, Fire Tiger Clan, and Wood Elf Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nine of the ten Upper Races under Lord Malevolence had arrived, with only the Mystic Feather Clan absent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, not far off, several Ultimate Malevolence Airships bearing the Mystic Feather Clan insignia floated quietly, their decks alive with flickering figures. Clearly, the Mystic Feather Clan was present but chose not to participate in Intergroup Clash Challenge Tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Paramount Supreme Clan not coming either?" someone inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've been invited, but they said they're in no rush. They'll only step in if we can't handle the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! Paramount Supreme Clan sure has a high opinion of themselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendees, all high-ranking members or exceptional talents from the Upper Races, felt little fear of Paramount Supreme Clan. A few complaints here and there were met with understanding nods. No one thought it out of line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another voice interrupted, "Forget about Paramount Supreme Clan and Mystic Feather Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got the majority of the young super talents from the nine Upper Races right here! That's more than enough to deal with the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings. After all, they're just a lowly community. How strong can they really be? The rumors we've heard are probably exaggerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, their agreed-upon time has come and gone, and still no sign of them. They must be too scared to show up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone chimed in, "Haha! That's likely the case!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The pathetic Human Community dares to set up a challenge against the young geniuses of our races? They're just asking for trouble. I bet they never expected so many of us to show up, and now they're too intimidated to make an appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd be pretty disappointed if that's the case!" The crowd buzzed with speculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time ticked by and the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings remained absent, impatience began to grow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is taking the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings so long? Are they too scared to show?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Typical of the lowly Human Community, all bark and no bite!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our young geniuses are here, itching to take you down. Why aren't you showing yourselves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic! Cowards! Can't even muster the guts to appear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Voices rose in anger, echoing through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, many turned their attention toward Divine Peak Nine, and their expressions shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They watched as eight young figures slowly emerged from the peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the group was a tall and striking young man&mdash;Osborne, disguised as Theodore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside him was Anastasia, transformed into Vivienne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, Mila, Kendra, Hannah, Bryce, and Diana followed closely behind, and their faces set with fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere shifted as the eight of them stepped forward, and their expressions were cold and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the group faced the densely packed Malevolence Airships and the tightly encircling warriors of various races, their expressions remained stoic, devoid of any fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Osborne's lead, they soared from Divine Peak Nine, their silhouettes cutting through the air like arrows, and finally landed on the colossal floating arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silence that followed was deafening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cacophony of jeers and taunts that had filled the air moments before&mdash;mocking their supposed cowardice&mdash;suddenly died down. The crowd's murmurs faded, replaced by cold, calculating glares directed at Osborne and his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings? But there are eight of them..." someone muttered, confusion etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One of them is from Mystic Feather Clan. That's Hannah! Supposedly, she's friends with the Seven Young Deity Kings. That's why they took out Aldrich and Alfred of the Bowman family. To protect Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City," another voice interjected, adding a layer of intrigue to the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's why Mystic Feather Clan didn't join the arena challenge this time," someone else added, piecing together the puzzle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Makes sense," the crowd murmured in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the guy in front that their leader? I heard his name is Theodore Augustine. It was him who personally killed Aldrich, the Deity King at the mid-stage!" another voice hissed, cutting through the chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's probably the strongest of the bunch," someone else said, and his eyes narrowed as they studied Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Killing Aldrich? Big deal? Plenty of young geniuses from other races could've done that. Does he really think that makes him untouchable? Please. He's living in a dream if he believes that'll intimidate anyone here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with whispers, and their gazes were locked onto Osborne and his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air grew heavy with tension as over a hundred young warriors from various races stepped forward, and their eyes were cold and sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're supposed to be the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, huh?"</span></p></div>
