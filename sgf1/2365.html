        <h1>Chapter 2292 More Dangerous-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara bit her lip hard, a twinge of unwillingness gnawing at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Osborne in surprise.</span><br><span>How on earth can Osborne fend off those bone-chilling winds in the fifth layer with just his Sacred Power, and even keep me safe?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It doesn't even look like he's breaking a sweat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is there really such a huge gulf between my Sacred Power and his?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm heading back to the fourth layer. What about you? You gonna check out the sixth layer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned and nodded. "Since we've come this far, there's no way I'm not going to the sixth layer to see what the deal is! You go back and wait for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara kept her mouth shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stole a glance at Leroy not too far off. Leroy was clutching the Inferno Drake Lance, and with its might, she could hold off the frigid winds of the fifth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't seem as carefree as Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Clara flashed a faint smile.</span><br><span>Does the official Zephyr State really think that just because Leroy has fully mastered the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance, she's stronger than Osborne? Ranking her above Osborne is a real knee-slapper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Clara made her way back using the Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, there were only about a hundred and fifty folks left in the fifth layer. Most of them were struggling to hold off the bone-chilling winds and had to rely on the power of Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was breezing through it, but then he thought better of it. He figured it was too showy, so he pulled out the Bloodwrought Bow and tapped into its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Rupert spoke up, "Nice! You guys didn't bugger off, so I guess you're all itching to see the sixth layer. All I gotta say is... you've got some serious guts! But let me tell you, out of all of you, only around twenty can really hack it in the sixth layer's harsh conditions! Even with those Sacred Artifacts, the rest won't last long!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you still have a chance to bail and skip the sixth-layer risk. If you get hurt and it messes up your state duel results, don't come crying to me saying I didn't give you a heads-up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Rupert finished his spiel, a lot of people looked at each other, but in the end, nobody backed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Looks like you're all a bunch of proud peeps! In that case, hang on tight to your Sacred Artifacts and let their power shield you! I'm taking you to the sixth layer right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Translocator leading to the sixth layer hummed to life. Osborne kept a sharp eye on it and noticed that it needed Sacred Crystals to get activated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne and the others were caught up in a dizzying whirlwind and vanished from the fifth layer, only to reappear in the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right away, Osborne heard the sickening sound of Sacred Power defense shields shattering, followed by a chorus of ear-splitting screams. If Rupert hadn't wrapped his power around them in the nick of time, they would have been in really bad shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne could feel a massive wave of pressure crashing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold winds in the sixth layer weren't just winds; they were a full-blown storm, a force of nature that could raze everything to the ground. Despite their Sacred Power defenses and the oomph from their Sacred Artifacts, the group was getting pummeled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people's defenses crumbled in no time. And even those whose shields held up were as white as sheets and wouldn't be able to hold out for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne even spotted that some of the top-twenty-ranked folks had gone pale as a ghost and quickly whipped out their Sacred Artifacts to fend off the sixth-layer storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson were still relying solely on their Sacred Power defenses to block the tempest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was clear they weren't having a walk in the park either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel his Sacred Power defense straining under the pressure. Sure, it could just about hold off the sixth-layer storm, but it was gobbling up his Sacred Power like there was no tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a bit of thought, Osborne deliberately put on a show of struggling to hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Rupert's power wrapped around him, giving him protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne felt a sneering look land on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Conrad!</span></p></div>
