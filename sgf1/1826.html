        <h1>Chapter 1825 The Strike</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The appearance of the dozen or so warriors silenced the crowd, their mocking and disdainful gazes fixed on Osborne and his group, as if they were merely watching a bunch of corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group quickly approached, and Darren's eyes lingered on three of them longer than the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them was the mid-stage Deity King warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orlando, I see you've made it to mid-level Deity King! You've certainly climbed the ranks fast!" Darren remarked, his tone cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando Hargrove, the leader of the Radiant Era Syndicate, regarded Darren with a calm demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darren? Not bad yourself. A year has passed, and you've managed to break through to Deity King! If I remember correctly, you were just a late-stage Deity Overlord a year ago. It seems you not only survived the Dark Deity Legion's onslaught but also had some lucky breaks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Pioneers of Starlight truly refuse to die! Even after being surrounded by a million Dark Deity Legion warriors, you somehow managed to escape unscathed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren scoffed. "Hmph! Compared to your Radiant Era Syndicate, we Pioneers of Starlight have a long way to go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were on the same mission, in the same location, and were nearly wiped out by the Dark Deity Legion. Yet you guys seem to have been completely unaffected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only did you all return alive, but your strength has also increased significantly. A year ago, there were only three Deity King warriors among you. Now, I see at least a dozen standing right in front of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando chuckled. "That's just good fortune on our part!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Radiant Era Syndicate is indeed different now! So, are you sure you're not going to leave? Even though you've become a Deity King, you're still not a match for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to meet your end, I suggest you get out of here! Honestly, I can't be bothered to kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren narrowed his eyes. "Kill me? You think you're worthy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me make this crystal clear, this is the base of the Pioneers of Starlight, purchased with the hard-earned contributions of all our members! This place belongs to us, not to you Radiant Era Syndicate scum!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you who should get lost! Get out now, or don't blame me for being ruthless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Darren finished speaking, Orlando's expression turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a disdainful look, Orlando continued, "You're asking for trouble! Darren, don't be so foolish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, this base belongs to the Pioneers of Starlight, but what does that matter? Do you have the power to take it back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Orlando Hargrove, quit wasting time on them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just kill them already! They're nothing but the last remnants of the Pioneers of Starlight! If we wipe them out, this place will be entirely ours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, let's finish them off!" the Deity King warriors behind Orlando chimed in coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando squinted, seemingly deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he let out a cold huff. "Fine! Keeping you alive is just a hassle! Since you're looking for death, I'll gladly oblige! You all will die here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he signaled to the ten or so Deity King warriors behind him, who immediately sprang into action, surrounding Darren, Osborne, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando's eyes flashed with contempt. "Darren, you didn't die at the hands of the Dark Deity Legion a year ago, but now I'll personally send you on your way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned slightly, expecting Darren to panic or show fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his surprise, Darren remained utterly calm, standing firm amidst the encirclement as if everything were under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unnerved Orlando, planting a seed of doubt in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, recalling the current strength of the Radiant Era Syndicate, he felt reassured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke coldly, "Darren, surrender! Considering you've become a Deity King, you're not without talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're willing to join the Radiant Era Syndicate and submit to us, I can spare your life! The Pioneers of Starlight is a thing of the past; you can align with us and share in our grand ambitions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren chuckled mockingly. "You think you can recruit me? You really think you're worthy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando's voice turned icy. "Darren, you're being stubborn? You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren burst into laughter, pointing at the Deity King warriors surrounding him. "Orlando, you think these weaklings can kill me? There's no need to hide your numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you call out all your Radiant Era Syndicate Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you have over fifty of them? Bring them all out; I'd hate to complicate things later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando's expression hardened dramatically at Darren's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know that?" he snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing gleam flashed through his eyes as he clenched his teeth. "Darren! You're digging your own grave! Do you really think we need to pull out all the stops to deal with the remnants of the Pioneers of Starlight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just us here can easily wipe you out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Orlando raised his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Deity King warriors of the Radiant Era Syndicate sprang into action, unleashing a barrage of attacks that engulfed Darren, Osborne, and the others, intent on eradicating them once and for all.</span></p></div>
