        <h1>Chapter 1428 Back to Superior Deity</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of anticipation building within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill! Kill! The more you take down, the faster I recover! Once I'm back to my Superior Deity strength and you're all worn out, that'll be my moment to strike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, you'll all become my Blood Clan descendants!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battle raged on, he took stock of Jeffrey and the others, gauging their abilities. Jeffrey stood out as the strongest among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was he a top-tier Transcendent Deity warrior, but he also possessed a Level Four Divine Body. However, in Osborne's eyes, Jeffrey's strength was merely average.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled the Transcendent Deity peak warriors he had defeated in the past&mdash;Terrence from the Deschanel Clan, Nelson from the Pantheon League, Emperor Dare of the Eityreia Organization, and the Dark Deity of the Apocalypse Harbinger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them was far superior to Jeffrey; they were on an entirely different level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other four squad leaders, all at the Transcendent Deity realm, were even weaker, hardly worth Osborne's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident that once he regained his Superior Deity status, even without fully restored space elemental essence, he could easily handle them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wouldn't stand a chance, no matter how many of them came at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing causing him concern was their Malevolence Amulets. Those amulets could absorb a lethal blow and create a powerful shield, which made him wary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they chose to scatter or send out a distress signal, it could pose a significant threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "I need to find a way to ensure they can't escape or send out any messages. I can only make my move when I'm absolutely certain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, I'd rather bide my time and wait for the right opportunity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he felt a jolt of energy surge through his body, and a grin broke out on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His third Divine Flame had finally reignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This signified that he had returned to the Superior Deity level. His Divine Body was healing at an impressive rate, with his strength, speed, and defense all restored to about eighty percent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though his space elemental essence and dark elemental essence were still recovering, he felt confident he could take on any Transcendent Deity warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the peak Transcendent Deity warriors wouldn't be able to match him now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've regained at least fifty percent of my strength compared to when I was on Blue Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's more than enough for now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can wipe out all these Deathborns and let the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity absorb their high-grade death scent, I might just return to my peak form!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If both my space and dark elemental essences recover, I'll ensure no one here gets a chance to escape or send out a signal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne kept a low profile, trying to communicate with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hoped it could assist him in restoring his space and dark elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the depths of space, his dark elemental essence had already reached mid-Level Six, while his space elemental essence was at the pinnacle of Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even typical Deity Overlord warriors couldn't hold a candle to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his elemental essences could fully recover, he could unleash a Level Six Realm that would envelop everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, restore my elemental essences!" Osborne urged the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, hoping for its help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had completed the fifth step of their fusion in the deep space, allowing for simple communication now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In response, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity conveyed its needs: it required more high-grade death scents to help Osborne restore his elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "More high-grade death scent, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All I need is to recover!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's just the high-grade death scent, right? There are over a dozen Transcendent Deity-level Deathborns and hundreds of Superior Deity Deathborns around. If I take them all down and absorb that high-grade death scent, that should do the trick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grin crept across his face as possibilities swirled in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a cold voice cut through the air, snapping him back to reality. The voice belonged to a squad leader of the Transcendent Deity realm, his demeanor tense and furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, what's so funny? We're all fighting for our lives against the Deathborn! On my team alone, three members were seriously injured, and we even lost one! And you're over there chuckling to yourself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the joke? Do you think it's funny seeing my team fall? You lowly human scum! Are you mocking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the tone of the voice, Osborne's expression shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, narrowing his eyes at the irate squad leader. This was a guy who had already lost one of his own to the Deathborn, who was torn apart and devoured without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anger simmering in his chest had finally found a target in Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, you humans!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why isn't it you who died instead? You worthless creatures should all be fed to the Deathborn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all this fighting, how many Deathborns have you even killed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you still have the damn nerve to laugh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get real, you pathetic waste!"</span></p></div>
