        <h1>Chapter 1173 Desperate for Energy!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was in a state of sheer panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy concentration outside was a hundred times that of the ground level&mdash;almost liquid in its density&mdash;but even that was far from enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed a massive influx of energy to forge his Divine Bone quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it wasn't just the Divine Bone he had to worry about; he also needed to create Divine Flesh to truly survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's just not enough energy! What am I going to do?" Osborne muttered, frustration bubbling up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that if he wanted to speed up the process of forging his Divine Bone under such insufficient external energy conditions, he'd have to find an alternative source of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like how his right leg bone had transformed into Divine Bone, Osborne had relied on the power of the Powerstone, a divine artifact, to achieve that metamorphosis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Age of Gods, ordinary cultivators had to painstakingly absorb energy over time, which meant their Divine Bones and Bodies often ended up underwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, the prodigies from powerful factions were always prepared, stockpiling various rare materials rich in energy that could be released rapidly. These resources accelerated the refining process, making their Divine Bones and Flesh far more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "So, I need something with a massive energy supply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But where on earth can I find such a thing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Dimensional Space contained a few divine artifacts&mdash;the Thundergod Gloves, the Volt Hammer, the Goddess of Grain's scythe, and the God Binding Rope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Goddess of Grain's scythe was devoid of energy, the other three artifacts&mdash;the Volt Hammer being a Premium divine artifact, and both the Thundergod Gloves and God Binding Rope ranking as top-grade divine artifacts&mdash;were all brimming with power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The catch? If he drained their energy, they would be destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wouldn't shed a tear over losing these divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, his life was paramount&mdash;artifacts could be replaced, but a life lost was gone forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he absorbed the energy from all three artifacts, it still wouldn't be nearly enough to rapidly refine his Divine Bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer amount of energy he required was staggering!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy from those three artifacts was a drop in the ocean; he needed a hundred times more to make any real progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where on earth can I find extra energy?" Osborne pondered aloud, frustration gnawing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled the Blood Cross, which was teeming with dense blood energy. After entering the rift, they had slaughtered over four hundred Class S Dark Exotic Beasts, and all that blood energy was now trapped within the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If condensed into energy blood droplets, they could elevate a hundred ordinary Blood Demon members to peak Class S status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even that wasn't enough for Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not by a long shot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that even if there were a hundred times more blood energy, it still wouldn't suffice for refining his Divine Bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy Osborne needed was just too immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he wished he could drain every last drop of energy from the Blue Planet itself! Osborne felt that only then would he have a chance to quickly forge his Divine Bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of despair settled in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I possibly acquire such an enormous amount of energy in such a short time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this really how it ends?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Am I really going to die here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip, feeling the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity stirring within him, its roots still growing, intent on merging with his body. But instead, it was sending shockwaves through him, threatening to tear Osborne apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cosmic Treasures... not everyone can handle them! Trying to force it only leads to disaster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bitter smile crossed his face as despair clawed at his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt like giving up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As that thought crossed his mind, the rate of Osborne's physical collapse accelerated. At this pace, he'd be reduced to a heap of mush and shattered bones in no more than three minutes, ultimately meeting his end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a spark ignited in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the presence of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he thought, "That's it! Cosmic Treasure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it is indeed a Cosmic Treasure, it must harbor terrifying power&mdash;far beyond that of any divine artifact! Otherwise, there's no way it could create such catastrophic tremors and crush my body like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity itself is composed of some form of peculiar, high-density energy! Cain mentioned that its energy level is far higher than divine power, which is why my Light of Redemption has no effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if I'm short on energy, why can't I draw power from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a small piece of energy from it might be enough to forge my Divine Bones and Flesh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can pull this off, I might just survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that realization, Osborne felt an electrifying rush of excitement. He understood that it wouldn't be easy to extract energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with hope in his heart, he wasn't about to back down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this!"</span></p></div>
