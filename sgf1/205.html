        <h1>Chapter 205 Severely Injured Apollo</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo looked at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Osborne was wearing a human skin mask, he did not recognize him as Clarissa's bodyguard captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you are the new boss of Skyefall Security! The one who tried to take me out before&mdash;it was you, wasn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "That is right, it was me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's eyes turned red with rage. "Good! You finally dare to show up. After killing so many of my men, I am sending you to hell today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha, that is my plan too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Let's see who ends up in hell after this fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo scoffed in disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Class C+ metahuman without even a soul of powers dares to talk big? Ha! Since you are eager to die, I will grant your wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo suddenly launched an attack. The Wind Tornadoes around him swirled fiercely, channeling immense power into his fist. He punched out, creating a small Wind Tornado that rapidly approached Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the small Wind Tornado absorbed more wind elements along its path, it grew larger, becoming a towering five-yard-high Wind Tornado when it reached Osborne, engulfing him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The immense pressure bore down on Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, this is the power of a Class B metahuman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive, but still far from enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, then threw a punch of his own, red light emitting from his fist. As his fist blasted out, it hit the massive Wind Tornado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, with a loud bang, the sound seemed to disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The red light emitted by Osborne seemed insignificant, but in the instant the two forces met, the massive Wind Tornado lost its energy and stopped spinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, with a loud bang, the enormous Wind Tornado disintegrated, its wild winds scattering harmlessly around Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was shocked. He thought, " I had put all my strength into that punch, confident that no one below Class B could withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne should have been dead or gravely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, with just a casual punch, Osborne had dispersed my full-force attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Apollo's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt immense pressure from Osborne, a sensation he had never experienced from a Class C+ metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo growled, "I do not know what your power is, but I refuse to believe a Class C+ metahuman like you can keep blocking my attacks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo launched a barrage of punches. Each punch produced a terrifying Wind Tornado, cutting through everything in its path like countless blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, he had thrown over a dozen punches, sending Wind Tornadoes at Osborne from every direction, giving him no escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin shouted in alarm, his face full of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm, a cold smile on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thick red Devil's Light enveloped Osborne's fists as he charged forward, smashing his fists into the Wind Tornadoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each punch, a Wind Tornado shattered, followed by the second, the third, the fourth...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was like a god of war, seemingly ignoring the terrifying Wind Tornadoes. With just a casual punch, he could shatter them effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere seconds, Osborne had destroyed all the Wind Tornadoes, reducing them to nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The red Devil's Light on his fists still glowed intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo, your skills are disappointing. Now it is my turn to attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and punched at Apollo, the intense red Devil's Light exploding like a blazing sun, reaching Apollo in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the power of the punch, Apollo's expression changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wind Tornado around him grew more violent, encasing him in a protective whirlwind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he gathered all his strength and punched out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous sound, Apollo's punch was shattered, and the red Devil's Light obliterated everything in its path. In a flash, it reached Apollo, and his protective Wind Tornado slowed down, howling as if in agony before finally dissipating with a loud crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining red Devil's Light struck Apollo, sending him flying. He crashed to the ground, skidding along the dirt, leaving a long trench before coming to a stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was extremely pale, with blood staining his lips. Severely injured and struggling, he finally managed to stand up by leaning against the tree trunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is your power? You do not even have a soul of powers. You are just a Class C+ metahuman. How can you defeat me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "You want to know why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ask Hades when you get to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne summoned an even more powerful Devil's Light and punched out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Meet your end!"</span></p></div>
