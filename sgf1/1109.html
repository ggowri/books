        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief as he saw Reginald finally stop struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God Binding Rope was originally one of Gerardo's divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had used it to capture Osborne once. Later, Osborne managed to escape and took the God Binding Rope for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some time now, Osborne had been refining the God Binding Rope, although he couldn't use it properly until he reached Class S. This was his first time wielding it in battle, and he was well aware of its capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the God Binding Rope entangled a target, it completely suppressed their power, rendering them almost powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Reginald was exceptionally strong, or perhaps Osborne wasn't yet skilled enough at controlling the God Binding Rope, allowing Reginald to resist even while bound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Osborne's transformation into his vampire form and the use of his blood-red hair, which also had a suppressive effect, combined with the God Binding Rope to finally subdue Reginald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Reginald with a cold smile and said, "I told you before that I would capture you alive, but you didn't believe me. Now, I've done just that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald stared back at Osborne with a mix of fury and fear, unable to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being captured alive by Osborne was a humiliation beyond words for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he could no longer sense any of his strength. He was powerless, completely at the mercy of even the weakest person. All he could do was glare at Osborne, helpless and enraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay put!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't waste any words on Reginald, as Bryce, Wesson, and the others were on the verge of collapsing. The three top-tier Class S warriors from the League of Divine Descent were unleashing a relentless assault, severely injuring each of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, they had the Crystals of Life to sustain them, but it was clear they wouldn't last much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Osborne appeared behind one of the top-tier Class S warriors, unleashing his full power. His devastating force was more than even Reginald could withstand, let alone this opponent, whose strength was far inferior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warrior was sent flying by Osborne's kick, his spine shattered, his body folding grotesquely, and he let out a piercing scream. His powerful vitality kept him alive, but only barely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, each top-tier Class S warrior is not to be underestimated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, and his eyes were cold. "Nonetheless, that is enough; having lost his combat power, he is left with only one fate: death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting any more time on the incapacitated warrior, Osborne swiftly moved toward the second top-tier Class S opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This warrior's face filled with terror as Osborne approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warrior thought, "Osborne not only captured Reginald alive but also nearly killed a top-tier Class S with a single kick?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of monster is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, the warrior turned and fled. Just moments before, he had been dominating Wesson and Miranda, confident that he could finish them off in a few moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But faced with Osborne, he chose to run!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for him, his speed was no match for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's Gaze activated, and the petrification power slowed the fleeing warrior just enough to give Osborne the opening he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A second later, Osborne was right behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a full-force attack, Osborne smashed into the warrior, obliterating half of his body in a bloody explosion. The man was beyond saving, his life rapidly slipping away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One more to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes locked onto the last remaining opponent, who was desperately fleeing in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you can escape?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interdimensional travel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne vanished and reappeared instantly in front of the terrified warrior, blocking his path. The man's face turned ashen, and in a moment of panic, he dropped his weapon and raised his hands high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I surrender!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but then let out a cold snort. His blood-red hair shot forward, piercing into the man's body to suppress his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's battles came to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only fight still ongoing was between Sebastian and Everett. However, Everett was clearly outmatched and struggling to hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw the dire situation around him, Everett's face turned to one of utter despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he, too, chose to surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the five top-tier Class S warriors from the League of Divine Descent were defeated: one dead and four captured alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the other battlefield, the Blood Demon members, in perfect synchronization, continued to take down the remaining League of Divine Descent warriors one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several of the League of Divine Descent warriors attempted to surrender, but the Blood Demon members, unable to suppress their powers or safely contain them, did not accept any offers of surrender. Without hesitation, they executed each one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the fighting came to a definitive end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The League of Divine Descent had deployed a total of four hundred Class S warriors, including the reinforcements. Except for the four captured alive, every last one of them was killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield was filled with a thick, pungent scent of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly absorbed the blood energy from the fallen, finally allowing himself to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The war was over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coalition of the Aberrants, Eityreia Organization, and the League of Divine Descent, which had launched a joint offensive to annihilate the Augustine family, was finally over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family had won!</span></p></div>
