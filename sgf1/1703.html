        <h1>Chapter 1702 Done and Dusted</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler spat out a mouthful of blood, his knees buckling beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, having drawn strength from the Blood Demon members, had experienced an immense power boost following his ascent to the peak of Deity Overlord. The Abyssal Spear not only shattered Chandler's formidable attack but also pierced through his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spear, under Osborne's precise control, went straight through his divine power essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Chandler's once-mighty divine power began to leak uncontrollably, like a balloon losing air. His face drained of color, an overwhelming wave of despair crashing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been so close to breaking through to the mid-tier of Deity King, but now he was defeated by someone still beneath that level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just minutes ago, if someone had suggested he would lose to a Deity Overlord, Chandler would have laughed it off as a bad joke, a figment of imagination meant to insult him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But reality had a cruel way of revealing itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There he was, facing Osborne</span><span>, </span><span>an opponent who hadn't even reached Deity King yet</span><span> </span><span>after unleashing his ultimate technique, completely and openly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler gazed at Osborne, his eyes filled with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a monster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Arnold and Mariah, locked in a fierce battle with Angelo, felt the chaotic outpouring of Chandler's divine power and turned their attention toward the source of the turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces reflected shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler, arguably the strongest warrior at Divine Peak Nine base, had fallen. Even if the three of them worked together, they wouldn't have dared to claim victory against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Chandler had crumbled</span><span>, </span><span>a lowly Deity Overlord had taken him down, a mere Human Community warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's divine power essence lay shattered before them, and fear sank into Arnold and Mariah's hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged wide-eyed glances, each mirroring shock and panic in the other's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, they charged at Angelo, blasting him aside before turning to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, they didn't care about the pride of being Deity King warriors; their only thought was to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could make it back to the Divine Peak Nine, they would be safe</span><span>. A</span><span>fter all, they had over 400 thousand elite warriors waiting for them there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Going somewhere?" Osborne sneered, his expression cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mere thought, his eight Spatial Clones sprang into action</span><span> and </span><span>vanish</span><span>ed</span><span> from sight only to reappear, encircling Arnold and Mariah in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of our way!" Arnold shouted, urgency coloring his voice. "Die, you monster!" Mariah added, panic spilling over into her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a desperate bid, they dropped their human forms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arnold hailed from the Thunderstorm Drake Clan. His true form was that of a colossal storm thunder dragon, a creature of unparalleled ferocity. His body was covered in deep purple and red scales, each one gleaming with an otherworldly sheen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His powers were a deadly combination of wind and lightning elements</span><span> and made</span><span> him a formidable force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he had reverted to his true form, Arnold found himself even more attuned to the winds and lightning, his powers amplified to new heights. He unleashed a maelstrom of fury, a tempest of wind and thunder that echoed across a staggering 60 miles. His goal was to shatter Osborne's clone barrier and make his escape from this treacherous place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mariah returned to her elven form, sleek and agile, with only pointed ears hinting at her true identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her power drew from the very essence of nature itself</span><span>, </span><span>the plant element.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she unleashed her full strength, vines and roots sprang to life, thrashing at the Spatial Clones in a furious attempt to break their blockade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Looking for a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight Spatial Clones wore expressions of disdain as they worked together, ready to counter any assaults from Arnold and Mariah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's surge in power upon reaching Deity Overlord's peak, his clones, too, experienced an increase in capacity, far exceeding what Arnold and Mariah, who were on par with Angelo, could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming force of the spatial power shattered Arnold and Mariah's ultimate attacks, leaving them reeling as their bodies were heavily battered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed from their mouths, and their screams of agony echoed through the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of the eight Spatial Clones, even being Deity Kings, they were no match at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it was remarkable how resilient they were; they fought fiercely to protect their divine power essence even while sustaining severe injuries to their Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, the clones struggled to completely wipe out their combat effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ultimately, their struggle proved to be in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an intense barrage, Arnold and Mariah could no longer hold their ground; their divine power essence was shattered by the relentless onslaught of the clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They collapsed to the ground, their faces painted with despair, like balloons that had just been deflated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Done and dusted!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cold smile widened as he looked down at Chandler, Arnold, and Mariah. With their divine power essences destroyed, they were now powerless to resist their transformation into the Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three Deity Kings, plus Angelo, the four highest leaders of Divine Peak Nine base! With them out of the way, it's a piece of cake to deal with the remaining 400 thousand elite warriors in their ranks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having made up his mind, Osborne wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood erupted from his body, rushing toward Chandler, Arnold, and Mariah, flowing into their wounded forms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the transformation took hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity anchored into their bodies</span><span> and</span><span> mend</span><span>ed</span><span> the shattered remnants of their divine power essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all three of them prostrated in submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, my Lord!"</span></p></div>
