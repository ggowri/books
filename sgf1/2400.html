        <h1>Chapter 2316 Hold Your Horses-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne finished his words, the atmosphere in the air turned thick with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy and Clara exchanged startled looks. In their view, Jared's team still packed a punch. They figured that if Jared wanted to leave, it might be wiser to just let him go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, forcing them to stay could be a risky move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if they ended up on the losing side in a fight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a brief moment of silent communication between them, they kept their concerns to themselves. They were a team, and since Osborne had made up his mind, they'd stand by his side, no questions asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared, on the other hand, was left completely gobsmacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I decided to bite my tongue and back off for now, but Osborne won't let us off the hook?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He wants me to fork over ten percent of my points? Is he nuts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Jared's eyes turned as cold as ice, and he let out a sarcastic laugh. "Hahaha! Osborne, you're something else! You think I'm leaving 'cause I'm scared of you? Well, if you won't let me go, fine! I'm not going anywhere! You wanna play? I'm game!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jared and his team wheeled around, ready to square off against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were seven of them in all. Three of them had been wounded by Osborne's Sacred Power arrows, but four were still in fighting shape&mdash;more than Osborne's threesome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared sneered, saying, "You three take on Leroy and Clara. I'll handle this punk Osborne myself! I'll show him what a real power gap looks like!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" the three responded, a wave of relief washing over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Sacred Power arrows were terrifying. Without a defensive Sacred Artifact, they knew it'd be an uphill battle to block his attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having Jared take on Osborne was the best-case scenario.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Leroy and Clara were strong, but they weren't as menacing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "Now we're getting somewhere! Let's see what the top dog of the Eight Great Academies is really made of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he loosened the string on his Bloodwrought Bow. A glistening Sacred Power arrow materialized and zipped straight towards Jared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get set!" Jared bellowed, and a huge wave of force radiated from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A turtle-shell-like Sacred Artifact popped up right in front of him, all set to soak up the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll find out! Your attacks might pack a punch, but with my turtle-shell Sacred Artifact, you won't lay a finger on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power arrow smashed into the turtle-shell artifact, and the noise was ear-splitting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Jared's horror, a crack appeared in the artifact's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face went white with terror as he grasped the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, the artifact hadn't shattered all the way and managed to block Osborne's arrow just in the nick of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the fear in his eyes was plain as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne's attacks are off the charts! His Sacred Artifact bow must be super powerful! I can't just stand here and take it! If he keeps shooting, even my defensive Sacred Artifact won't last!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm Jared, the top dog among the disciples of the Eight Great Academies, ranked in the top thirty in the state duel! There's no way I'm going down to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a battle cry, Jared charged forward, clutching his Sacred Artifact tightly, ready to pour everything he had into taking on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha!" Osborne let out a mocking chuckle, his voice oozing with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not gonna waste any more time on you. You might as well just lie down and accept your defeat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paid no heed to Jared's attack and concentrated on his own move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another Sacred Power arrow materialized on his Bloodwrought Bow. It was even more dazzling than the last one and zipped out at a blinding pace, clashing with Jared's onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared's attack crumbled like a house of cards against Osborne's Sacred Power arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow kept flying straight at Jared without a hitch. In the blink of an eye, it reached Jared and slammed head-on into the turtle-shell Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the defenses of the turtle-shell Sacred Artifact shattered into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming force hit Jared, piercing through his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Jared let out a scream of agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was sent flying through the air, and blood spurted everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared then crashed down hard into the snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head flopped to the side as he passed out, thoroughly beaten and broken.</span></p></div>
