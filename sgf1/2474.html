        <h1>Chapter 2379 Strange Teeth-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne described his feelings in detail, which immediately piqued </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> interest. "Even your Satan's Eye can't see through it? And there's a special energy that's unperceivable? But staring at it for too long causes your Satan's Eye to feel pain? This is indeed quite interesting!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial became interested, started observing more carefully, and silently pondered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne did not disturb him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Primordial couldn't identify the origin of that tooth, Osborne still planned to buy it for future research.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, anything that even Satan's Eye can't see through is definitely a treasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just by its shape, it looked like a massive dagger. Osborne thought it could be directly hung on the Warfare Ancient Tree to let the tree nurture it for a while.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps this way, he might truly obtain a decent Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you taken a liking to anything?" the shop owner asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was ready to act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He casually picked up a fake Empyrean Sacredness bone and calmly asked, "How much for this Empyrean Sacredness bone? I plan to take it back and have the elders of my sect refine it. It should reach the quasi-Sacred Artifact level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quasi-Sacred Artifact?" The owner sneered, "My Empyrean Sacredness bone, combined with some other materials and casually refined, would at least become a Sacred Artifact! And you want to use it to make a quasi-Sacred Artifact? Isn't that a waste?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "I lack the strength to handle a true Sacred Artifact. Besides, I don't have much money. If this Empyrean Sacredness bone is too expensive, then forget it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, he got up and prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey! Don't rush. I haven't given you a price yet!" The owner's eyes darted around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Empyrean Sacredness bone Osborne had his eye on was actually a fake, costing only a dozen Sacred Crystals. Although the owner wanted to quote a high price, he was afraid of scaring Osborne away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, he said, "We&rsquo;re destined to meet, so I&rsquo;ll sell it to you at a discount! This Empyrean Sacredness bone is top-notch! Thirty thousand Sacred Crystals, take it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned after hearing that. "Thirty thousand Sacred Crystals? Impossible! It's just an Empyrean Sacredness bone. I don't want it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, he pretended to leave again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The owner quickly said, "Hey! What price would you accept? Name your price. If I can agree, I'll sell it to you. If not, then you can leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately put on a pained expression. "Five hundred Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew in his heart that this fake Empyrean Sacredness bone was worth no more than ten Sacred Crystals. The reason he offered such a high price was to keep the owner from noticing his true intention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Five hundred Sacred Crystals? Impossible!" the owner shouted. "At least fifteen thousand Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way, I'll offer at most six hundred Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, twelve thousand Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After some haggling, they finally settled on twelve hundred Sacred Crystals. On the surface, both Osborne and the owner looked pained, as if they had suffered a loss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in reality, both were secretly overjoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out twelve hundred Sacred Crystals, just about to hand them to the owner, but suddenly pulled his hand back and said, "No! I feel like I'm losing out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Throw in that pile of useless bones too! This is over a thousand Sacred Crystals, just for one Empyrean Sacredness bone. I can't explain this when I go back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Give me this pile of useless bones, and I'll feel better! Otherwise, I won't buy it..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The owner frowned immediately upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, he still nodded. "Alright! I really can't do anything about you. I'll throw in this pile of useless bones for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Give me the Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately said, "Deal!"</span></p></div>
