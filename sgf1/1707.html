        <h1>Chapter 1706 The Super Genius</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne devised a plan for himself and Anastasia. They would pose as a couple, using the names "Theodore" and "Vivienne" to showcase their strength at various events, aiming to build their reputations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If both "Theodore" and "Vivienne" became household names in Celestara, the chances were high that Osborne's parents would make the connection if they were still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, while it was common for one person to share a name, the likelihood of two </span><span>people sharing the two same names was much slimmer. In that case, his parents might come looking for them, curious about the familiar names.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined to enhance their chances, Osborne decided to use the Eclipsing Mantra to transform his appearance to resemble his father when he was younger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Anastasia would take on the youthful visage of his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his parents were still alive, seeing their likenesses would surely draw them to meet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, this all hinged on the possibility that they were alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't sure if this plan would actually lead him to his parents, but he knew he had to try. If he failed, then it would simply be fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered how to make a name for themselves in Celestara while ensuring their safety, an idea began to take shape in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a bit risky, but the potential rewards made it worth a shot. Most importantly, it would serve two purposes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to discuss this with Anastasia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flash, Osborne entered Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had spent most of his time there lately</span><span> and</span><span> enjoy</span><span>ed</span><span> the company of his grandfather and Anastasia. Though they had plenty of Celestial Crystals, breaking through to become Deity Kings was not something that happened overnight; it required time and patience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!" Anastasia and Zoe had just finished their training when they spotted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They rushed over, beaming, and each wrapped an arm around him in a warm embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a rush of warmth at their affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, I have a plan, and I need your help," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laid out his idea</span><span> and</span><span> watch</span><span>ed</span><span> as Anastasia's eyes lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count me in! I've been getting a bit restless here at Hope Haven anyway. Whatever you need me to do, I'm all in! Just hope I don't hold you back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled at her enthusiasm. "How could you? You might not realize just how incredible your talent is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He studied her for a momen</span><span>t and</span><span> recogniz</span><span>ed</span><span> her as a true prodigy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Anastasia had first broken through to Junior Deity, she had forged a Level Six Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was no small feat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the top Deity Kings of the Human Community hadn't achieved that caliber when they became Junior Deities; most only managed Level Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Anastasia's Divine Body had reached the pinnacle of Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During her transitions to Superior Deity and Deity Overlord, her body underwent transformations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time, she evolved from Level Six to Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second time, for reasons she didn't fully understand, Anastasia couldn't break through to Level Eight; she only reached the peak of Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Anastasia was on the verge of becoming a true Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she remained patient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed her Divine Body still had untapped potential and wanted to refine it to </span><span>Level Eight before making the leap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By doing so, when she finally did ascend to Deity King, her Divine Body would undergo another transformation</span><span> and </span><span>g</span><span>ave</span><span> her a strong chance to reach Level Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would be a Level Nine Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Level Seven Divine Body was known as the Solar Divine Body, while Level Eight was considered the Galactic Divine Body. The ultimate achievement, however, was the Cosmic Divine Body at Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even among the top seven Deity Kings of the Human Community, most of their Divine Bodies were only at the Galactic level. Rumor had it that the most powerful among them, the God of Night, possessed a Cosmic Divine Body, but that claim had never been verified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body was truly astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's goal was clear</span><span>. S</span><span>he aimed for that coveted Cosmic Divine Body. With her talent, she could have easily broken through to become a Deity King already, but she sought to refine her abilities first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's skills were remarkable across the board, and her comprehension of her powers set her apart from others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she wielded lightning elemental essence like a true master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back on Blue Planet, Osborne had initially focused on Thunder Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after witnessing Anastasia's mastery over it, he felt overwhelmed by how inferior his own abilities were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he abandoned Thunder Power altogether, realizing there was no comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived in Celestara, Osborne had to adopt Thunder Power again to maintain his disguise as "Lachlan," but even then, he knew there was no way his power could match Anastasia's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lightning elemental essence had surpassed Level Seven, and now she stood at the pinnacle of Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne felt a chill of fear when she unleashed her Thunder Power. He knew his divine power defenses wouldn't hold against her; she could easily harm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In every conceivable way, Anastasia was stronger than Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a true prodigy</span><span>, </span><span>one capable of defeating Deity Kings even while remaining in the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's cheeks flushed slightly as she said, "Osborne, you're laying it on thick! Compared to you, I still have a long way to go!"</span></p></div>
