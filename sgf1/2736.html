        <h1>Chapter 2604 The Fourth Invitation-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Seraphina in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could have broken through to Empyrean Sacredness over a hundred years ago, suppressing her cultivation level for so long and storing her power in a special container? Once she breaks through, she'll directly become a mid Empyrean Sacredness?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isn't this almost the same as him?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, when he took the Perfect Dragon Elixir, he almost couldn't suppress his cultivation level and was ready to break through. He ultimately stored the surging power in the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to avoid breaking through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne estimated that once he breaks through to Empyrean Sacredness, he will directly become an advanced Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he just smiled, "Oh? Impressive! Breaking through directly to mid Empyrean Sacredness... But unfortunately, even then, you still won't be a match for me! I suggest you don't bother me; it would be better to let Hendrix come instead..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina immediately looked disdainful upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Haha, did you understand what I said? I'm still no match for you? Let's wait and see! As for Hendrix... hehe, Hendrix is at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, and he's about to break through to become a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With just you? Hendrix wouldn't even take you seriously! He could crush you with one hand!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "Oh? Then let's wait and see!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, if you're done, please step aside! Otherwise... I don't mind bullying you again. If you fight back, I wonder if Callista would expel you from the Palace?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's expression changed upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She snorted coldly, "Osborne, just you wait! In Necropolis City, I will personally defeat you and make you kneel before me and beg for mercy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina turned and left directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't take Seraphina's words to heart. He left the Royal Sepulcher and continued heading back to the hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy, however, looked a bit serious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, is what Seraphina said true? Once she breaks through to Empyrean Sacredness, can she really reach mid Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "It should be true! She has no reason to lie to us..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then you need to be careful! That Seraphina is indeed very powerful! She fused four types of power even before reaching Empyrean Sacredness, it's simply unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Got it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, don't rush to break through your cultivation level these days!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We know! Our Sect elders already told us! Glorious Divine Kingdom had mentioned long ago that within three days after the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ends, we are not allowed to break through our cultivation level. They will take us to a special place where opportunities await us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly stunned. He thought Clara and Leroy didn't know, but it turned out they had already been informed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you know!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying this, Osborne and the other two had already returned to the hotel. They didn't go to the Empire Hotel but stayed in the same small hotel as before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out the Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take this Legendary Dragon Elixir and use it to quickly improve your strength! The place Glorious Divine Kingdom is taking us to not only has opportunities but also dangers!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The stronger you are, the better your chances of survival, otherwise..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're likely to die in there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, Clara and Leroy's expressions changed, then they nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, we got it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy returned to their rooms and entered seclusion again to absorb the Legendary Dragon Elixir and enhance their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no room for improvement anymore.</span></p></div>
