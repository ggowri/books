        <h1>Chapter 2256 Yapping Cur-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I can see you're actually quite talented! But how dare you call me a yapping cur? Who do you think you are? You're just asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tyson unleashed an even mightier energy, bearing down on Osborne like a tempest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no option but to stop in his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he kept his cool, his expression serene as he retorted, "Calling you a yapping cur would be an insult to real dogs! It seems your </span><span>brain's</span><span> on the fritz. Consider this your warning&mdash;don't mess with me, or I swear you'll live to regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a searing killing intent burst forth from Osborne, instantly shattering Tyson's overbearing energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's face turned ashen, and he staggered back a few steps. A twinge of panic and fear shot through him at Osborne's sheer intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that only stoked the flames of his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flared a deep, blood-red, and he was itching to lash out. Just then, a taunting voice sliced through the tense atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, quite the spectacle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From afar, several towering figures shot forward like lightning, closing the distance in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's expression hardened as he recognized them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marreese!" Tyson gritted through his teeth, his attention completely diverted to the newcomers, forgetting all about Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of Fantasia Isle behind him tensed up at the sight of Marreese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the undefeated champion of the last city duel, a true powerhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, he had mowed down his opponents effortlessly. His blade had cut down anyone foolish enough to oppose him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a brutal showdown, he had vanquished Tyson. After a relentless barrage of ninety-nine strikes, he had shattered Tyson's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, it was this slim advantage that saw Marreese declared the winner by the referee and crowned champion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson had never come to terms with that defeat, firmly believing that he could defeat Marreese if given another shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the new city duel on the horizon, Tyson saw his opportunity for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle spirit surged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese, however, remained unfazed. With a calm smile, he addressed Tyson, "Listen up, Tyson. This is Azure Haven Academy, not your playground at Fantasia Isle. If you want to throw punches, you can wait until the city </span><span>duel</span><span> stage. For now, it's best you keep your head down and avoid trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or you'll feel my wrath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was measured, but the underlying threat was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze swept over the crowd, including Osborne and the Mystic Sirius Sect disciples, making it clear that he wouldn't tolerate any nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned but chose to remain silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson, however, seethed with anger. "Marreese, what's with the arrogance? I heard you got taken down by someone&mdash;a woman, no less! You're not even the top disciple at Azure Haven Academy anymore, are you? Ha! What a loser!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese's brows snapped down into a sharp V, and his eyes narrowed to cold, menacing slits. "Yeah, I lost to a woman named Leroy. But I lost with dignity. If you think you're better than me, I hope you run into Leroy on the stage. She'll set you straight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dismissive wave of his hand, Marreese added, "Now, clear out! This is Azure Haven Academy. If anyone causes trouble here, don't say I didn't warn you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His companions unleashed their energy, their glares as cold as ice, firmly fixed on Tyson and his gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson let out a disdainful snort but managed to rein in his temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, fine! I'll do Azure Haven Academy a favor today. But on that stage, if you dare to cross my path, I swear I'll leave you all needing stretchers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Tyson stomped off, his fury practically radiating from him as he led his group away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply clamped his lips shut, spun around on his heel, and headed straight back to his quarters.</span><span> </span></p></div>
