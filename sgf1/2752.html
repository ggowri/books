        <h1>Chapter 2616 Adventure</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the royal family came out, Adriana was the first to appear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This not only represented her noble status but also her top-notch strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among all the experts invited by the royal family, Adriana was undoubtedly the strongest. Moreover, she was completely different from when Osborne had seen her before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she was also wearing armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This armor was crystal-clear and radiant, as if carved from ice, emanating an incredibly powerful Sacred Artifact aura. Although it couldn't compare to Frederick's Panoply Armor, it was in no way inferior to Callista's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Osborne feel very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had previously worried that Adriana's armor was far inferior to Frederick's, but now it seemed he had overthought it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairy Moon Sect was even feared by Frederick, so its strength and foundation were naturally formidable. Even if it still couldn't match the royal family, it wouldn't be far behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, if Fairy Moon Sect weren't powerful, Frederick wouldn't have forced Adriana to marry him, nor would he need to lead Fairy Moon Sect to become a subordinate force of the royal family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a middle-aged woman stood beside Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged woman was also clad in Panoply Armor, just like Adriana's Crystal Armor. The aura emanating from her was even on par with Adriana's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up once again. He knew this middle-aged woman was one of the two deputy palace masters of Fairy Moon Sect, Adriana's right-hand woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he didn't expect that this Deputy Palace Master had also reached Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's great!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They have reached Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. They are already very powerful! Even if the royal family wants to deal with them, it won't be easy. Besides, there are also strong figures from other major forces..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at the person who appeared behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are nearly fifty people here. They are the leaders of various First-rate Powers from the Glorious Divine Kingdom, and all of them have reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness in cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, among them, only three have reached Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only three people have reached Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, while nearly fifty have achieved Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. With such strength, even if they face the Glorious Divine Kingdom's royal family, I can't say they will definitely win," Osborne thought to himself, glancing at Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the Crystal Armor Adriana was wearing, Osborne felt envious. If he wore the Crystal Armor, he might have reached Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, and it would be much harder for others to harm him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne knew that such Crystal Armor was too precious, and even the Fairy Moon Sect didn't have many of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, it's hard for ordinary people to control it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People wearing such Crystal Armor consume a massive amount of Sacred Power every moment, and even those who have reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection might not be able to endure it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne could handle it, but he was too embarrassed to ask Adriana for it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick! Queen Callista."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the contestants all bowed to Frederick and the others, showing immense respect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was unwilling to bow to Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt Frederick was his enemy, the one who personally executed his mother.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would rather kill Frederick. How could he possibly bow to Frederick?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, everyone was bowing. If Osborne did nothing, he would stand out too much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne simply pretended to be absent-minded, as if he hadn't seen Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been looking around earlier, but when it was time to bow, he appeared absent-minded. Of course, he couldn't escape everyone's notice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne refuse to bow to Frederick, the royal family members immediately showed angry expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were about to scold Osborne, but suddenly stopped for some reason.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, Frederick glanced at Osborne indifferently, not caring at all whether Osborne bowed to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Is everyone here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Time's up. In that case, let's not waste any more time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's get ready to go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, the three hundred palace guards behind him began to move. They quickly set up on the massive square after taking out some items.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne looked very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the One-way Cosmic Translocator?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, it's a Level Three One-way Cosmic Translocator. After arriving in Necropolis City, they actually need to use a Level Three Cosmic Translocator. Could it be that Necropolis City is not in the Glorious Divine Kingdom? It's not even on the Racial Convergence Planet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is it in another Stellar Region?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only knew that Necropolis City was the Glorious Divine Kingdom's greatest secret, and he had thought Necropolis City was hidden somewhere within the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turns out it's in another Stellar Region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, they wouldn't need to use a Level Three One-way Cosmic Translocator at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne watched the palace guards set up the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Others were watching it too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, aside from Osborne, the others present might not understand at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Cosmic Translocator seems to be built quite roughly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne couldn't help but joke to himself, "If I were setting it up, I could definitely arrange this Cosmic Translocator more perfectly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, these people are too slow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So many people setting up the Cosmic Translocator are not even half as fast as Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, before long, the Cosmic Translocator was finally set up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all the guards withdrew, Frederick personally stepped onto the Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a surge of power surrounded him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew what Frederick was doing. After the One-way Cosmic Translocator was set up, the transmission coordinates needed adjustment. At this moment, Frederick was setting the coordinates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Frederick knew the coordinates of Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, Frederick didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know the location of Necropolis City, so he used his power to prevent others from peeking and ensured no one could reach Necropolis City through the coordinates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye, trying to see where the coordinates set by Frederick were.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, even with Satan's Eye, he couldn't see it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power around Frederick was incredibly strong and unique, making it completely impossible for Osborne to see it even with Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne wasn&rsquo;t worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had other ways to obtain the coordinates of Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne sneered, "Soon, Necropolis City won't just be your secret. I will know it too..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waited patiently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Frederick set the teleportation coordinates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, get on!" Frederick said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the palace guards and over twenty princes and princesses stepped onto the translocator, and Osborne and the others followed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, Adriana and the people around her didn't move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana calmly said, "Emperor Frederick, before entering Necropolis City, shouldn't you give us what you promised?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished speaking, the people from the other factions behind her all nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's right! Emperor Frederick should give us what was promised now. As soon as we get it, we'll immediately step onto the translocator and venture into Necropolis City with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick heard this and immediately gave a faint smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, no problem! Each faction will receive twenty Supreme Sacred Artifacts, and I&rsquo;ve already prepared them for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick tossed out over twenty Dimensional Bags.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana and the others took the Dimensional Bags, quickly checked them, and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, they also stepped onto the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's set off!"</span></p></div>
