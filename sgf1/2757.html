        <h1>Chapter 2620 Spirit-Entombing Roses</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne asked, those who hadn't reached Empyrean Sacredness all looked at Frederick with anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among everyone present, the royal family members were the strongest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The royal family members included Frederick, Callista, over a dozen high-ranking royals who had reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, several princes and princesses of varying strength, and three hundred royal guards at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their strength was the greatest. Once the Skyfall Casket was opened, they would surely be able to enter it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides that, if the powerhouses of various forces joined together, they would also form a formidable strength. A total of fifty experts at Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness could surely enter the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most awkward ones were Osborne and the others who hadn't reached Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their cultivation level and strength were low, so no one cared about them. According to Frederick, they only needed to enter the Celestial Spire to retrieve the key inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for whether they could enter the Skyfall Casket, Frederick didn't say.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought he'd better clarify this matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick looked at Osborne and said calmly, "Of course! I've already told you that as long as you retrieve the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, everyone can enter it. Of course, no one knows how many dangers are inside the Skyfall Casket. If you have confidence in yourselves, you can give it a try. If you're unwilling to take the risk, you'd better stay outside..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, everyone only has one life. If you die in the Skyfall Casket, don't blame anyone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said nothing more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at the Celestial Spire. Feeling the terrifying aura of the Celestial Spire, he couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Celestial Spire has a total of ninety-nine floors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There is a challenge on each floor, making a total of ninety-nine challenges. If they can obtain a Skyfall Casket key every nine challenges, they should have the keys to nine Skyfall Caskets by the eighty-first floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Above the eighty-first floor, there are still seventeen more floors. What's going on with that?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What will they get on the ninetieth floor?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What will they get on the highest, ninety-ninth floor?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thinks this Celestial Spire is far from simple; it can't just be for storing Skyfall Casket keys. There might be an even bigger secret hidden within the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, in Necropolis City, the Celestial Spire is located in the upper left corner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The nine Skyfall Caskets seem to be suppressed by the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, if they want to uncover the secret of the Celestial Spire, they must pass all ninety-nine levels of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, that's too difficult!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "The Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet only made it to the seventeenth level. Even with all of Frederick's preparations, Princess Seraphina can at most reach the eighteenth level and get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she wants to keep advancing, it will definitely be tough!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How many levels can I pass?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't know, because he was still unsure about the difficulty of the levels in the Celestial Spire and couldn't predict what he would encounter there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would only know everything after going in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But if I get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket first, should I use it to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket? Once I open it, Frederick might break through his cultivation level after entering and become a powerhouse at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But if I don't do that, I will miss an opportunity like the Skyfall Casket. That would be such a pity!" Osborne thought silently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick, how much longer do we have to wait?" someone impatiently asked Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Soon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Frederick finished speaking, he looked toward the direction of the Celestial Spire. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Spirit-Entombing Roses have appeared!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone quickly looked over. Beneath the massive Celestial Spire, a strange and incredibly lush patch of plants suddenly appeared. These plants were swaying and growing rapidly around the base of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, these plants grew to hundreds of thousands of feet tall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each plant reached hundreds of thousands of feet tall. They looked densely packed, impossible to count.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even so, compared to the enormous Celestial Spire, these hundreds-of-thousands-of-feet-tall plants appeared incredibly short, as if they were merely flat grass.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, blue flower buds suddenly appeared on these plants, each spanning tens of thousands of feet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, billions of flower buds bloomed in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a kind of blue exotic flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each flower had nine petals and nine stamens, with intricate patterns on every petal...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those patterns seemed to form the shape of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, as the stamens gently trembled, blue rays of light began to emanate, quickly enveloping the entire Necropolis City and surging toward Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, be careful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick shouted, "The Spirit-Entombing Roses have bloomed! Necropolis City has been opened, but at the same time, the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance has also emerged!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, be careful!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Spirit-Entombing Fragrance directly attacks soul power! If you can't resist it, the Soul Current Ocean will shatter. The higher the cultivation level, the more Spirit-Entombing Fragrance it attracts. So, you Americans must handle it carefully..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Frederick finished speaking, everyone's expressions turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soul attacks are extremely dangerous for anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Frederick looked serious. They dared not relax at all, fully prepared to endure the Soul Attack from the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the blue light quickly enveloped them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Watch out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly warned Clara and Leroy behind him, while Adriana's reminder echoed in his mind. "Osborne, be careful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blue Spirit-Entombing Fragrance swept down like a tidal wave, engulfing everyone present in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt as if his head had been struck hard with a hammer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, his soul power was strong enough, and the Soul Current Ocean was nearly impenetrable. Such a Soul Attack was nothing to Osborne. He initially felt uncomfortable but quickly recovered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, screams kept echoing around Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind him, at least a dozen contestants who hadn't reached Empyrean Sacredness were screaming as they collapsed to the ground, blood streaming from their mouths, noses, and ears, their bodies convulsing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the three hundred royal guards in the distance, dozens suddenly collapsed to the ground, blood flowing from their mouths and noses, their eyes filled with confusion and fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even among the powerhouses of various factions who had reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, several screamed and fell to the ground. The remaining ones looked pale, clenching their teeth tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, they were all enduring a terrifying Soul Attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, aside from Osborne, almost everyone looked pale, gritting their teeth to resist the attack. At least over a hundred people had already collapsed to the ground, blood streaming from their mouths and noses, including several royal princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a terrifying Soul Attack!" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Clara and Leroy behind him. Seeing that they were merely pale but still able to withstand the attack, he immediately breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne noticed that the blue light around them was becoming increasingly intense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blue light, originally evenly distributed around, seemed to be drawn in and began converging toward their bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blue light grew stronger and stronger...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Subsequently, the soul power attacks also grew stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More and more people collapsed to the ground, bleeding from their mouths and noses. Clearly, the Soul Current Ocean had shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They're finished.</span></p></div>
