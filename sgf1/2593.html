        <h1>Chapter 2484 Four Sacred Artifacts-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron listened, his eyes filled with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's one thing for Osborne to make me swear by the Divine Principle. But now, he even demands at least one Supreme Sacred Artifact as compensation?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Supreme Sacred Artifact, is that something easily obtainable?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had cultivated for tens of thousands of years, and as the deputy leader of Skyearth Dominion, he only possessed one Supreme Sacred Artifact, which was of a supportive type, not meant for attack or defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, he had already far surpassed most beings at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, most Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection beings don't even have a single Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's not because they can't afford it, but because Supreme Sacred Artifacts are far too rare, with almost every piece in the hands of renowned supreme warriors. These people lack no resources and naturally wouldn't sell their Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only possible place to obtain a Supreme Sacred Artifact might be the treasury of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. But even there, entry qualification can only be exchanged with Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people are willing to pay a high price for these Scorepoints, just for a chance to exchange for a Supreme Sacred Artifact from the treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, this path is still tough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, Supreme Sacred Artifacts are extremely rare and precious, and Aaron only owns one. Osborne demanding him to compensate with one made him particularly furious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when he saw Adriana beside Osborne, no matter how furious he felt inside, he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t dare show it, let alone explode.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only endure the humiliation and appease, "Osborne, I truly apologize sincerely. I</span><span>'</span><span>m even willing to swear by the Divine Principle that I will never leak today</span><span>'</span><span>s matter, nor will I retaliate against you or cause you trouble in any form. But asking me to compensate with a Supreme Sacred Artifact is really difficult. I simply don</span><span>'</span><span>t have one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How about this, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll figure something out and compensate you with five Legendary Sacred Artifacts? No, ten Legendary Sacred Artifacts! In terms of value, ten Legendary Sacred Artifacts are no less than one Supreme Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron's face revealed a fawning smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne sneered and said, "Ten Legendary Sacred Artifacts? It seems Vice Leader Aaron is indeed wealthy! In that case..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron was now staring excitedly at Osborne, thinking Osborne had agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the next moment, Osborne said, "Since that's the case, my previous compensation request seems a bit too low. Now, I want not only one Supreme Sacred Artifact but also an additional three Legendary Sacred Artifacts! If you can't provide them, I'm afraid my anger will be hard to quell. In that case, I'll have no choice but to ask my master to deal with you directly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After killing you, I'll search your body. Who knows, I might find even more treasures?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished speaking and gave Adriana a meaningful glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled faintly and said, "That works too! Since he can't offer compensation that satisfies you, just deal with him and save the trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a faint aura of pressure emanated from her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron's face instantly turned pale with fear, full of terror. Sensing Adriana's subtle killing intent, he wished he could slap himself hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shouldn't have negotiated with Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, not only did Osborne reject his proposal, but he also demanded three more Legendary Sacred Artifacts as compensation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Worse still, he had no room to refuse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he refused, he would face Adriana's merciless strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Aaron's heart was filled with resentment toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's greed made him grit his teeth. He even wanted to tear Osborne to pieces or imprison him for centuries, even millennia, of torment.</span></p></div>
