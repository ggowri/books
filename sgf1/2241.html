        <h1>Chapter 2215 Arrival at Necoton Planet</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum raced through the cosmos at an impressive speed. Even without pushing its full power, it took only three days to approach </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they looked back, </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet had completely vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before them loomed a vibrant green planet, its size comparable to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, covered in towering trees that seemed to touch the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Sanctum drew closer, the planet appeared more and more magnificent. Soon, they would be landing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gathered on deck, gazing at the distant world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, releasing Maddox and his six companions from Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, my Lord!" They all bowed respectfully to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and asked, "Maddox, you've been to </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet, right? What can you tell us about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox quickly responded, "Yes, my Lord! We have all visited </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the only one among the nearby small life planets that has a Cosmic Translocator! Warriors from the surrounding planets have to come here if they want to reach the Racial Convergence Planet. Likewise, anyone from Racial Convergence Planet must first arrive at </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet to access this star system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet is much more prosperous than </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, largely because it hasn't suffered as many disasters or wars. The most powerful faction here is called the Phantom Tide Demon Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Cosmic Translocator on </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet is guarded and maintained by the Phantom Tide Demon Sect. They rake in a wealth of resources like Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs every year through the Translocator! The leader of the Phantom </span><span>Tide Demon Sect is Bancroft Brunson, a member of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bancroft is an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, a quasi-Empyrean Sacredness warrior! His strength far surpasses that of a newly ascended Lord Malevolence, as he has held that title for over a thousand years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've also heard that Bancroft has connections in Racial Convergence Planet. The reason they chose to build the Cosmic Translocator here was because Bancroft had established ties there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bancroft? Connections in Racial Convergence Planet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know what kind of connections?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox shook his head. "I'm not sure. But an elder from the Mystic Sirius Sect once warned me not to cross Bancroft, or I'd be in for some trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That suggests his connections are at least tied to an Empyrean Sacredness warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, his expression growing serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">An Empyrean Sacredness warrior?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with my recent breakthrough to Ascension Seven, I'm far from confident in facing one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I encounter an Empyrean Sacredness warrior now, my best bet will be to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems we can't afford to directly confront the Phantom Tide Demon Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My goal is to investigate whether my parents are with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just need to find out who's in charge of their slave trade and capture him. A quick memory search should do the trick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If my parents have indeed been sold to the Phantom Tide Demon Sect, I'll find a way to rescue them and get out. If they're not here, we'll just leave quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne took control of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, guiding it toward </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet, there was just one major metropolis&mdash;Phantom Tide City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It served as the nerve-center of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect and was home to the Cosmic Translocator. If one wanted to travel from </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet to Racial Convergence Planet, he had to pass through Phantom Tide City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum touched down quietly near Phantom Tide City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The busy city around them didn't even bat an eye at its arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had assumed they'd land on </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet without a hitch. But no sooner had they touched the ground than several peculiarly designed flying warships zoomed towards them, quickly encircling the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each warship sported a huge flag with a terrifying skull emblazoned on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the insignia of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect!" Maddox blurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, then nodded firmly. "Maddox, you take care of this. Just tell them we're planning to use the Cosmic Translocator to head to Racial Convergence Planet, but we'd like to hang around on </span><span>Necoton</span><span> for a few days first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox nodded, getting the gist of the task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a dozen figures dropped down from the Phantom Tide Demon Sect's warships. They were all from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for their cultivation levels, the leader was an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, </span><span>and the rest were anywhere from Ascension Two down to Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were no pushovers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you guys? What are you doing landing on </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet?" the leader of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect warriors barked, eyeing the beat-up Ascending Sacred Sanctum with a blend of suspicion and curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd never seen a ship like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox stepped forward, oozing confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me! I'm Maddox </span><span>Corenswet</span><span> from the Mystic Sirius Sect on Racial Convergence Planet. We were here not too long ago. Now that our business is wrapped up, we're planning to head back, but we thought we'd stick around on </span><span>Necoton</span><span> for a few days first..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Maddox finished talking, the warrior from the Phantom Tide Demon Sect visibly loosened up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, giving a respectful nod, "Oh, it's Mr. Maddox </span><span>Corenswet</span><span> from the Mystic Sirius Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's an honor to have you on </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet, and we're really honored that you're visiting the Phantom Tide Demon Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. </span><span>Corenswet</span><span>, allow me to show you to your accommodations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox nodded in appreciation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, one of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect's warships flew ahead toward the distant Phantom Tide City, while the others continued their patrols.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum soon arrived at Phantom Tide City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, no flying vessels are allowed over Phantom Tide City, so we should disembark from the Ascending Sacred Sanctum now!" Maddox reminded Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne agreed, not wanting to stir up trouble so soon after arriving on </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He retracted the sanctum and led Isa and Maddox into the bustling streets of Phantom Tide City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the rest of their group had already entered Hope Haven, using Elemental Gold Crystals and Sacred Crystals to rapidly boost their cultivation levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Kendra, Bryce, Diana, and Hannah were all still at Ascension Two and needed significant time to strengthen their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't improve, they'd struggle to find their footing on Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Anita, although at Ascension Seven, felt the pressure to enhance their cultivation levels as well. Time was of the essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Isa had reached Ascension Nine and was close to Ascension Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She chose to stay by Osborne's side, ensuring he was well taken care of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and the others had agreed to take turns looking after him, making sure he was never alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had voiced his objections, but in the end, they had fallen on deaf ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's find a place to stay first. Then we can figure out the specifics about the Phantom Tide Demon Sect. Their involvement in the slave trade is their biggest secret, and uncovering it won't be easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we can't rush into this!" Isa warned, sending him a subtle glance that suggested they were being watched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, having sensed the presence of Phantom Tide Demon Sect experts keeping an eye on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear they were wary of any potential trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more cautious they were, the more it hinted that the Phantom Tide Demon Sect had something to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's settle in first. Then we'll devise a plan."</span></p></div>
