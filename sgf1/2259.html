        <h1>Chapter 2228 Special Wooden Golem-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox cast a skeptical eye on Anastasia, Zoe, and the rest, and Osborne couldn't suppress a soft chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evidently, Maddox had yet to witness their true mettle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had unwavering faith in their abilities. Taking on a Wooden Golem of the same cultivation level was no Herculean task. No matter how formidable the Golem, he was certain they could rise to the occasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they couldn't handle this, it would spell bad news for all the disciples of Mystic Sirius Sect's Peak Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It might even imply that no one within the sect was up to the challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was lost in these thoughts, Terrance's sneering voice cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do they hail from some backwater life-bearing planet? A so-called genius from a puny world? That's a laugh! Every year, hordes of so-called prodigies from small and micro life-bearing planets flock to Racial Convergence Planet. But how many actually make the cut to join </span><span>the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect through the assessments?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back on their home turf, they're treated like royalty, strutting around all high-and-mighty, thinking they're invincible. But here? This is Racial Convergence Planet, the heart of the Glorious Divine Kingdom! Those so-called geniuses are nothing more than run-of-the-mill folk in this grand scheme of things!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, I doubt any of them will pass the practical assessment!" Terrance's disdain was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox let out a cold huff but didn't argue, still focused on Osborne. He knew Terrance's words held some truth, even if they were a bit extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the so-called geniuses from small life-bearing planets faded into obscurity when they arrived at Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They simply couldn't compete with the local talent, whose skills were light-years ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Maddox recognized that Osborne and Isa were exceptions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when it came to Anastasia, Zoe, and the others, he felt a twinge of doubt. Would they be able to pass the practical assessment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, breaking the tension, "Looks like we have no choice but to participate in this practical assessment, right? Otherwise, we'll have a pack of dogs nipping at our heels."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance's expression turned icy at Osborne's words. "Are you insulting me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking for death? Or do you really think Maddox can protect you? You dare to talk back? Do you want me to end you right here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, "I don't believe you can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance bellowed, his power surging forth like a tempest and bearing down on Osborne, " You're just begging for a beating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think a measly Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King can throw his weight around in front of me? If you've got any courage left in you, step into the arena! I'll even let you have the advantage of using just one of my hands. It'll be an all-or-nothing fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you up for it?" he goaded, a smug look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent a jolt of excitement through the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like we're in for a real spectacle!" someone yelled, barely containing their enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! That bloke won't take the challenge. He's only an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King. How could he possibly have the nerve to face off against Terrance? Even if Terrance held back, he could still crush this guy without breaking a sweat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't fret, he'll surely back out with his tail between his legs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne listened to the crowd's buzz, a frosty smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Step into the arena? You've got to be joking. You're not even in my league. I have no interest in picking on you, and I definitely don't want to start my journey at </span><span>the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect with a bloody fight.</span></p></div>
