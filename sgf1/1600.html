        <h1>Chapter 1599 Twist the Truth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena's gaze swept over Calvin, and as she realized he had been crippled by Osborne, her expression turned colder than ice. The murderous intent in her eyes deepened to an intense fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Osborne actually crippled Calvin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After so much effort to find a man who could satisfy me, a man who could bring me joy, only for him to be ruined by Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What use is a broken Calvin to me? He's less than a commoner now; he can't fulfill my needs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts raced through her mind, Athena's murderous aura intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming pressure radiating from her, a mid-tier Deity Overlord, spread throughout the Malevolence Airship. The thousands aboard stood frozen in fear, their expressions a mix of shock and dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned their eyes toward Osborne, gazing at him as if he were already a dead man walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they couldn't fully grasp why Athena was so furious about Calvin's defeat, they understood one thing. Athena's strength and status made her someone no one could safely cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she wanted Osborne dead, it was a foregone conclusion that he wouldn't make it out </span><span>alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, feeling the weight of Athena's hostility, tensed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was a powerful figure in the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he wasn't afraid of her, a confrontation would force him to reveal his cards&mdash;something he was keen to avoid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with thousands of soldiers loyal to Athena around, if she commanded them to rush him, even Osborne would have no choice but to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a retreat would expose even more of his strengths, jeopardizing his plans within the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chance to reach Divine Peak Nine would evaporate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he had no intention of confronting Athena just yet; he needed to bide his time until they reached Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, he addressed her directly, "Greetings, Ms. Athena Huntington! I don't understand why you are so furious. Did I do something wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Athena's expression grew even colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you do something wrong? Do you really want me to spell it out for you? You acted out on my Malevolence Airship, crippling another chiliarch. You've seriously violated military regulations! If I decided to end you right now, it would certainly be deserved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "Seriously violated military regulations? I can't agree with that! Sure, I might have taken Calvin down, but he pushed me into it! Everyone here saw it; Calvin struck first. I showed restraint and even warned him a few times, but he refused to listen and continued to attack me. I had no choice but to retaliate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By your logic, does that mean I should just let him hit me? Should I have just extended my neck for him to finish me off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena's smile was laced with sarcasm as she responded, "You want to lecture me about military regulations?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you're worthy of that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you claim Calvin attacked you first&mdash;where's your evidence? Did anyone else witness this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena's icy glare swept across the crowd, her gaze landing on each individual with an unmistakable air of menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere shifted as everyone tensed under her scrutiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Athena Huntington, I didn't see Mr. Calvin Swift strike Mr. Augustine first! From what I observed, they were both engaged in combat!" one soldier stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! I didn't see that either!" another quickly chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I witnessed Mr. Augustine make the first move!" a third voice added, trying to curry favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw it too! It was definitely Mr. Augustine who attacked first. He showed no respect for you, and that's a serious breach of military protocol that deserves harsh punishment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! He should be severely punished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in a chorus of support for Athena, adamantly denying that Calvin had attacked first and even going so far as to claim that Osborne had initiated the </span><span>conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A satisfied smile crept onto Athena's lips as she turned her cold gaze back to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, do you have anything left to say? You've severely violated military regulations, and for that, you deserve to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seize him and confine him at once!" she commanded, prompting a group of soldiers to step forward, grinning maliciously as they advanced toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, you'd better surrender quietly. Don't force our hand! If you make any sudden moves, we won't hesitate to put you down on the spot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the ground, Calvin couldn't help but grin with satisfaction, his face twisted with pain yet filled with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed Osborne with a vicious glare and muttered, "Damn you, Osborne! You dared to cripple me? Don't think you're getting away with this&mdash;go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was one of cold fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the crowd that had turned the truth on its head, disdain radiating from his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were completely unreliable, exactly as he had expected, though he had never put much trust in them to begin with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called out, his voice steady despite the chaos, "Wait a second! Ms. Athena Huntington, are you really going to condemn me based solely on their word? They're saying I struck first? I think they're deceiving you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they're lying to their superior, isn't that also a violation of military regulations? They're all guilty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, I recorded everything that happened. Ms. Athena Huntington, take a look for yourself..."</span></p></div>
