        <h1>Chapter 2490 The Cage-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person in charge of the Cosmic Translocator muttered, "Are you planning to use the Cosmic Translocator to go to Stellar Region M72?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That place doesn't have many intelligent beings, just a bunch of Stellar Exploration Organization members, Space Pirates, and some low-intelligence bugs that attack on sight. Why are so many people going there lately?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I activate the Cosmic Translocator just for you to head to Stellar Region M72, you'll need to hand over 100,000 Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing these words, Osborne raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He first took out 100,000 Sacred Crystals and handed them over, then asked, "Hello, have many people been heading to Stellar Region M72 recently?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person smiled but didn't answer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking for a moment, Osborne took out another 10,000 Sacred Crystals and forcibly handed them over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the person's attitude improved greatly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly put away the Sacred Crystals and whispered, "I&rsquo;m in charge of this Cosmic Translocator. In the past, I wouldn&rsquo;t encounter even a few people heading to Stellar Region M72 in a year. But in the past six months, at least dozens of groups have requested to activate the Cosmic Translocator to go to Stellar Region M72. And this is just the number of people from my Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The entire Glorious Divine Kingdom has at least dozens of Cosmic Translocators leading to Stellar Region M72. If every Cosmic Translocator is experiencing the same situation, then many people are heading to Stellar Region M72. Moreover, Evernight Court has even more Cosmic Translocators."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne was very surprised and quickly exchanged a glance with Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela shook her head and said to him through Telepathy, "There&rsquo;s definitely something wrong. But I don&rsquo;t know exactly what it is. Maybe something happened in Stellar Region M72. However, Fairy Moon Sect doesn&rsquo;t pay much attention to that place, so we haven&rsquo;t received any news about it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "In that case, let&rsquo;s head over first. Our target is just the Frenetic Storm Warband. We don&rsquo;t need to get involved in anything else."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela also nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the three of them stood on the Cosmic Translocator. After receiving Osborne's Sacred Crystal, the person quickly activated the Cosmic Translocator for Osborne and adjusted the coordinates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person smiled and said, "I&rsquo;m ready to activate the Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's quite far from here to Stellar Region M72. Since you haven&rsquo;t reached Empyrean Sacredness yet, you might feel a bit uncomfortable. But just bear with it. Oh, by the way, I can give you a piece of information for free."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Cosmic Translocator can only transport you to an abandoned resource-bearing planet on the edge of Stellar Region M72. If you want to reach Inferno Planet in the core area of Stellar Region M72, you&rsquo;ll need to head to another resource-bearing planet first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the Cosmic Translocator was fully activated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Angela, and Agatha's figures instantly vanished from Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt a wave of dizziness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, he could handle it. Soon, he calmed down and quietly waited for the teleportation to finish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Stellar Region M72 is far from Racial Convergence Planet and closer to the edge of the cosmos than Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long while, Osborne finally felt his feet touch the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly activated Satan's Eye and looked around. Immediately, he realized they had arrived on an incredibly desolate and quiet planet. Here, they could hardly see any stars overhead; everything was dim, much like the situation on Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this place was closer to the edge of the cosmos than Abyssal Planet. Osborne could feel a gentle breeze brushing against his body, leaving him tingling as if electrified.</span></p></div>
