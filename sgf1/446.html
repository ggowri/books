        <h1>Chapter 446 Breaking Through</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">Nathan was seething with anger at this moment, and after venting his frustrations, he felt much more satisfied.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Brian&#x27;s expression suddenly changed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He tried to pull Nathan back, but it was too late. Nathan had already said what was on his mind.</p><p style="text-align:left;">All Brian could do now was look at Alexander with a face full of caution.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander&#x27;s expression grew cold. &quot;Nathan, who do you think you are? How dare you challenge me? I am now the head of the Paltrow family, and you&#x27;re not even an heir. When I speak to your father, do you think you have the right to interrupt? You should be punished for breaking the rules.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With that, Alexander suddenly waved his hand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A bolt of purple lightning appeared out of thin air and struck Nathan with such speed that he had no time to react.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Watch out!&quot; Brian shouted as he instantly appeared in front of Nathan. But before he could do anything, the purple lightning struck him directly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a deafening explosion, both Brian and Nathan were sent flying, their bodies charred.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander had held back. He didn&#x27;t intend to kill them. If he had, they wouldn&#x27;t just be charred. They would have been two corpses by now.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brian suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood, his face pale and grim.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Nathan, beside him, was stunned. Seeing his father so severely injured while trying to protect him filled him with rage. He pointed at Alexander, ready to lash out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But this time, Brian stopped him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brian&#x27;s jaw clenched, barely containing his fury. &quot;Mr. Paltrow,&quot; he ground out, &quot;I take full responsibility for Nathan&#x27;s disrespect. I apologize on his behalf. He&#x27;s been disciplined. He&#x27;s already been punished. Can we go now?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander&#x27;s eyes narrowed in disappointment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He hadn&#x27;t expected Brian to take such blatant humiliation lying down. This left him with no clear excuse to continue his vendetta against the Augustines.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As Brian prepared to leave, Alexander casually remarked, &quot;Mr. Augustine, what&#x27;s the rush? My wedding&#x27;s about to start. Stay and enjoy the festivities.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He leaned in, his tone hardening. &quot;Business is business, but let&#x27;s not let it spoil the friendship between our families. Leaving now would be a slap in the face to me and the entire Paltrow family.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brian clenched his teeth, his face filled with frustration. But in the end, all he could do was nod.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Paltrow family was stronger than the Augustine family, and Alexander&#x27;s power far surpassed his own. After all, they were on the Paltrow family territory. Even if Brian felt humiliated, he had no choice but to endure it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If they gave Alexander an excuse to act, they would only face even greater humiliation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">No one would stand up for them!</p><p style="text-align:left;">The mocking glances from those around them were proof enough.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Fine, we&#x27;ll stay and continue to join the ceremony.&quot; Brian could only swallow his humiliation, forcing himself to endure the pain as he and his companions sat down once more.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Disappointment flashed in Alexander&#x27;s eyes again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Humph! I want to see just how much the Augustine family can endure! Next up is my wedding with Clarissa... Osborne, will you keep hiding like a coward?&quot; he pondered. &quot;Will you show up? I can&#x27;t wait to see if you will!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With that thought, Alexander nodded at the host.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The host immediately announced, &quot;And now, the moment we&#x27;ve all been waiting for! Please welcome the bride, Ms. Radcliffe!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">In an instant, everyone turned to look at the entrance of the venue.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The wedding was about to begin!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Meanwhile, back at Isa&#x27;s mansion, Osborne&#x27;s eyes fluttered open.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A sudden burst of light shot out from Osborne&#x27;s gaze. He felt a sense of well-being he had never experienced before. It was as if the whole world had come alive in his perception—everything was more vibrant, more real.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Did I... succeed?&quot; Osborne murmured to himself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isa suddenly appeared before him and said, &quot;Yes, you did! You&#x27;ve now become a Class A Power Master. Your soul of powers has been fully transformed and integrated with your body. Why don&#x27;t you try feeling your new strength?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne&#x27;s eyes lit up with excitement at her words, but when he glanced down at the time, his expression instantly changed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Today is the wedding day?&quot; He sprang to his feet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isa hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded. &quot;That&#x27;s right. According to the Paltrow family&#x27;s plan, Alexander and Clarissa&#x27;s wedding is happening right now.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne&#x27;s mind went blank, and his face turned pale instantly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He no longer had time to marvel at his newfound strength and rushed out the door in a frenzy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing this, Isa bit her lip hard. &quot;Osborne, don&#x27;t be in such a hurry. The wedding hasn&#x27;t officially started yet. You should clean yourself up first. You&#x27;re filthy. If you go to meet Clarissa like this, she won&#x27;t be happy.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After a brief hesitation, Osborne nodded and quickly dashed into the bathroom.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As he showered, he began to sense the changes in his body.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Merging the soul of powers with the body was an uncharted path, one that no one had ever attempted. According to Isa&#x27;s assessment, the benefit of doing this would be faster control and quicker execution of his abilities.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At the same time, his body was growing stronger.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne could indeed feel his newfound strength, but just how much stronger he had become was something he would need to test against an opponent to truly understand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Finally, Osborne&#x27;s power had greatly increased.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Without wasting time on a more thorough examination, he quickly dried off, got dressed, and prepared to head out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just then, Isa approached with a box and handed it to Osborne.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What&#x27;s this?&quot; Osborne asked, curiosity piqued.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;This is for you. It&#x27;s a gun. It seems to be a reward from the Godfather for completing your mission.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isa&#x27;s words left Osborne stunned.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He glanced at his Draco Star Wristlet, and sure enough, the reward for the first part of the fifth heir&#x27;s trial had been settled.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His reward was—a gun!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne was taken aback as he accepted the box, frowning. &quot;Godfather gives me a gun as a reward? That&#x27;s all?&quot;</p></div>
