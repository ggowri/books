        <h1>Chapter 2657 The Artifact Soul of the Apocalypse Bow-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Primordial kept winking at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned for a moment, then understood what Primordial meant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He followed Primordial's words and said, "You're absolutely right. This Apocalypse Bow dares to claim to be the Supremacy Bow of the Cosmos. I also think it's fake. I believe it's not even as good as my Bloodwrought Bow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It seems to reject me, but I think it doesn't dare let me use it, because once I do, it will be exposed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial agreed, "Exactly. It's just trash. You should throw it away. I'll help you find a more powerful bow in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright." As he spoke, Osborne suddenly felt the Apocalypse Bow in his hand tremble slightly. Immediately, a surge of power erupted from the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne felt the Sacred Power within him completely drained.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, an arrow appeared out of thin air and shot toward Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The arrow pierced through Primordial's body. Primordial let out a scream and then fell off Osborne's shoulder. A large hole appeared in his chest, unable to heal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation left Osborne stunned. He thought, "It's so fast! Its speed is incredible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Apocalypse Bow in his hand suddenly released an arrow, piercing through Primordial's body. Not only did Primordial fail to dodge, but Osborne also couldn't react in time to stop it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly looked at Primordial. Seeing that Primordial was unharmed, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne looked at the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Apocalypse Bow hovered in midair, circling around Primordial as if mocking him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was utterly shocked because he actually sensed the consciousness of the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Apocalypse Bow has consciousness too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's mocking words angered the Apocalypse Bow, causing it to suddenly unleash its power and teach Primordial a harsh lesson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only that, the Apocalypse Bow also mocked Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a surge of information suddenly appeared in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne opened his mouth in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial got up and glared at the Apocalypse Bow. "I knew you were pretending to be dead. Since you're a Sovereign Artifact, you must have already developed consciousness, an Artifact Soul. Even if you're shattered, you can still hide your power so perfectly, which led me to conclude that your Artifact Soul is still alive. So, I used this method to provoke you, and sure enough, you reacted."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, I still don't believe you are the Supremacy Bow of the Cosmos. I don't know if others believe it, but I certainly don't."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Primordial climbed back onto Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had just mocked the Apocalypse Bow on purpose to provoke its Artifact Soul together with Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, he succeeded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, he was also shot by the Apocalypse Bow as a result. Luckily, the Apocalypse Bow only wanted to teach him a lesson and didn't seriously injure him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's the situation now? Have you connected with the Apocalypse Bow's Artifact Soul?" Osborne asked, looking at the dazed Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "The Apocalypse Bow's Artifact Soul is very weak. It said I can use it, but only once a day and only for one shot. In return, I have to find a way to repair it. The better it recovers, the more frequently I can use it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the Apocalypse Bow, there was actually a living Artifact Soul, just like in the Celestial Spire. This Artifact Soul allowed Osborne to use the Apocalypse Bow, but he could only shoot one arrow a day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's the use of that? Besides, Osborne didn't even dare to think about repairing the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Apocalypse Bow is a Sovereign Artifact. Osborne simply doesn't have materials of such high grade to repair it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps he could only rely on the Warfare Ancient Tree to gradually restore the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't overthink it. Being able to shoot one arrow with the Apocalypse Bow was better than not being able to use it at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Apocalypse Bow could still unleash the power of a Supreme Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An arrow it shoots might severely wound a supreme warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "I'm ready. It's time to enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p></div>
