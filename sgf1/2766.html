        <h1>Chapter 2627 Consecutive Challenges-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got 10,000 battle points this easily? This is way too simple!" At this moment, everyone was extremely excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The warriors' projections emerging in the light pillar were merely equivalent to ordinary Ascension Ten Supernal Deity Kings, let alone the fact that they had already advanced to Empyrean Sacredness. Even if they hadn't, they were fully confident in swiftly defeating them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll take on the second one!" Someone couldn't hold back and rushed straight into the light pillar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A warriors' projection immediately appeared before him. Following Seraphina's guidance, he fully prepared himself and unleashed a force, striking the Battle Points Monument with precision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the Battle Points Monument flashed red, he immediately launched a full-force attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the warriors' projection on the opposite side was instantly crushed, the entire process taking less than one breath. He successfully gained a full 10,000 battle points from the Battle Points Monument, with the striking red number "10000" appearing above his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Subsequently, the illusory staircase to the second level appeared, and he proceeded to enter the second level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm next!" Then, everyone took turns stepping into the light pillar to challenge the levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, everyone took turns entering the light pillar to challenge the levels. Each person managed to defeat the warriors' projections within one breath, earning the maximum reward of 10,000 battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All fifty-six people took only a few minutes to pass the first level's test and successfully entered the second level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne appeared near the light pillar with Clara, Leroy, and Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them didn't have Satan's Eye, so they were unaware of the specifics and could only curiously watch the light pillar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne briefly explained the situation, they immediately became excited. "You can earn battle points as rewards for clearing levels in the Celestial Spire? These points can even be exchanged for resources, treasures, or even Sacred Artifacts or combat techniques on the ninth and eighteenth floors?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their eyes were filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded. "Let's go! The first level isn't hard, as long as we don't make mistakes, we should pass easily. They've already entered the second level, so let's catch up quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three quickly said, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stepped into the light pillar first, quickly completed the trial, and earned a full 10,000 battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he saw the red numbers floating above his head, he couldn't help but feel surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "How is this formed? This isn't just simple energy condensation. If it were, I should be able to easily destroy or alter it, but in reality, I can't affect these red numbers at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it, anyway, I don't feel any danger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Osborne entered the second level of the Celestial Spire through the staircase projection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The environment of the second level was similar to the first, also shrouded in dense black fog, but the fog was thicker, further reducing the visibility range for ordinary people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina and the others were continuing to advance deeper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, to successfully pass each level's trial, one must first locate the specific trial site. Once the location is determined, it relies solely on one's own strength to overcome the challenge and earn the reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Clara, Leroy, and Casey also successfully entered the second level, Osborne led them forward once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The trials of the Celestial Spire are way too easy!" Casey said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "Don't celebrate too soon! That was just the first level's trial. The higher you go, the harder it gets. Don't forget, back then, the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet all failed at the seventeenth level and couldn't reach the eighteenth."</span></p></div>
