        <h1>Chapter 1522 Powerful Hannah</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Hannah unleashed an overwhelming surge of power. Her vast divine power intertwined with dark energy, forming an endless barrage of black arrows that rained down upon the Deathborn like a violent storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These arrows were not only numerous but also devastatingly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one pierced through the Deathborn, exploding on impact, obliterating both the Superior Deity and Transcendent Deity ranks without mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air filled with the heavy scent of high-grade death, lingering over the main mine shaft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, dozens of Deathborn fell before her, leaving Osborne gaping in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always known Hannah was strong, but this was beyond anything he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her dismantle the Deathborn with such ease felt more like witnessing a bombing run than a simple skirmish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I actually thought she might struggle due to a lack of experience! What a mistake that was! With this kind of power, who cares about experience? She could steamroll right through them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder the Gellar family, despite knowing that she had no experience dealing with Deathborn, still allowed her to handle the numerous Deathborn in the mining area alone, without any concern for her safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such strength, what is there to worry about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head in disbelief, thoroughly impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Hannah's strength eclipsed even that of Fabian. While Fabian was a Deity Overlord, the pressure and shock he had instilled in Osborne paled in comparison to what Hannah was demonstrating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are all the geniuses from the Upper Races this powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder the Human Community in Celestara is stuck in the West Zone. Clans like the Mystic Feather Clan have ten members under Lord Malevolence! And Mystic Feather Clan is not even ranked at the top!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A serious expression crossed Osborne's face as he pondered the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though, I must admit, Hannah's ability to merge divine power with dark power is quite fascinating. But I don't need to learn that technique; my elemental essence has long fused with my Divine Body, allowing my powers to interchange and grow even stronger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he kept pace with Hannah, he couldn't shake the awe he felt watching her unleash her attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deathborn around them were swiftly dispatched, but from the depths of the mine, more Deathborns surged forward, fearlessly charging into the fray, driven by an insatiable hunger to consume everything in their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how effortlessly Hannah dispatched the first wave, she grew increasingly calm and confident, her attacks becoming more relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More Deathborn fell under her relentless assault, and the stench of high-grade death thickened in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no opportunity to intervene, Osborne decided it was time to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called upon the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, urging it to begin absorbing the high-grade death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Devour it! Devour it! Let's get you back to full strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement bubbled within him. Agreeing to help Hannah was proving to be a brilliant decision. Out in the wild, even with a significant amount of Soul Resonance Fluid, it would have taken him ages to attract this many Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here, they were falling like wheat before the scythe, courtesy of Hannah's might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't even need to lift a finger; he simply reaped the rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity began to silently absorb the high-grade death scent through its roots, and he could feel its vitality returning, the roots and leaves stirring with renewed life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Totally focused on the battle, Hannah was oblivious to the subtle movements of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, which was quietly thriving in the wake of her explosive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah fought like a goddess of war, ruthlessly harvesting the lives of the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter whether they were Superior Deity or Transcendent Deity level, any that stood in her way were crushed in an instant. Together, they sliced through the ranks of the Deathborn, pushing deeper into the main mine shaft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ten intense minutes of battle, the number of Deathborn slain by Hannah had soared into the thousands. However, fatigue began to show on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her divine power was starting to wane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like she's lacking a bit of experience. She's not controlling the pace of the fight well. Ten minutes in, and she's already drained her divine power too much. I need to pull her back to recover," Osborne thought to himself, finally deciding to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, fall back and use that Essence Crystal to restore your divine power! I'll hold the line!" he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! Just give me five minutes&mdash;no, three minutes! I can get back to peak condition in that time. Just hold them off for three minutes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she stepped back, clutching a top-grade Essence Crystal to begin her recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at the crystal in her hand, thinking, "The Upper Races really know how to live!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the Gellar family facing a shortage of Essence Crystals, Hannah still uses a top-grade one to recover. Talk about luxury!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He positioned himself in front of Hannah, ready to defend her while she recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah's had her moment; I can't let myself be outshone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce determination, Osborne unleashed his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Judgment Thunder Drake!"</span></p></div>
