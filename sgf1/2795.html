        <h1>Chapter 2648 No More Hiding</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A total of sixty people entered the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina and five other Royal Family members were killed by Frederick's furious strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others remained silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, those were Frederick's children. Although everyone found his actions extremely twisted, no one dared to stop him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Frederick's fury did not subside; he even launched an attack on the other fifty-four people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among these people, aside from Osborne, Clara, and Leroy, nearly everyone else came from first-rate powers within the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their elders are right here at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Witnessing their outstanding disciples about to become the targets of Frederick's wrath, the warriors of various forces could no longer stand by.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all spoke up, trying to dissuade him, "Frederick, calm down!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Frederick, stop!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all at Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness and spoke up, trying to stop Frederick from harming their disciples.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Frederick seemed not to hear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His terrifying power continued to erupt, swiftly pulling over fifty young warriors toward him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne began to struggle under the pressure of this force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Leroy, Clara, and Casey had already flown toward Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, save them quickly!" Osborne's expression changed drastically as he immediately contacted Adriana through telepathy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next moment, Adriana acted decisively, unleashing a powerful force to forcibly stabilize Osborne, Clara, Leroy, and Casey, preventing them from being dragged over by Frederick's power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Warriors from other factions, seeing Frederick ignore their warnings and still take action, also stepped in to protect their disciples.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Power clashed fiercely in the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dozens of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors joined forces to strike. Even with Frederick's immense strength, he couldn't resist, and eventually, those over fifty individuals were frozen in place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Frederick's eyes turned even redder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone spoke to Frederick, "Frederick, you should stop! Killing your children is your family matter, we won't interfere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But these young people are the elite of our sect, the future pillars of our sect. We cannot allow you to slaughter them at will!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Failing to obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket is not their fault. They are not obligated to secure the key, nor should they bear responsibility for it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Others chimed in, "That's right! Kill your children if you must. Even if you kill all of us, we won't say a word. But if you dare harm my disciple, I will never agree!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since we don't have the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket and can't enter to seize the opportunity, staying here is meaningless. Let's leave now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right! Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors of various factions were now protecting their respective disciples, preparing to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, Frederick threw his head back and laughed, his laughter full of arrogance and disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He swept his disdainful gaze over everyone present.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You want to stop me from killing these worthless fools? Do you think you can? And you still dream of leaving here alive? What a ridiculous joke!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you can open the Skyfall Casket, perhaps I'll spare you for now and focus on obtaining the power within to break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But now my plan has failed. We don't have the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket. I'll have to figure out another way."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, you who know the secrets of Necropolis City still expect to leave safely? Isn't that even more ridiculous? How could I let you reveal its secrets to others? How could I possibly let you leave alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, not only must those worthless fools you're protecting die, but none of you should expect to survive either!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick's eyes burned with raging killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words made everyone&rsquo;s expression change&mdash;everyone except the members of the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Frederick, how dare you say you'll kill all of us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're crazy! Frederick, do you think you can kill all of us? We dared to accept your invitation and come here because we already anticipated you'd make a move against us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We have fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors on our side. And your Royal Family? Only a dozen or so! Even if you're a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, you can't possibly kill all of us so easily!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I advise you to calm down. If we really go to war, you'll pay the price, and so will the entire Royal Family. Be careful not to end up with mutual destruction!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right! Do you really think we're afraid of you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The warriors from various factions instantly became furious, unleashing their power and aura, pressing toward Frederick in an attempt to force him back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, including forty-seven Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness and three Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they all pressured Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing their combined pressure, even though Frederick was at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level, he could hardly bear it and kept stepping back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the expression on his face remained unchanged, still wild and furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered, "Not bad! The combined strength of you all would even make the Royal Family extremely wary. In fact, I've long wanted to eliminate you completely. Your factions have been growing and expanding on the territory of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, becoming increasingly powerful, and have already become a threat to the Royal Family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I don't get rid of you soon, one day you'll overthrow us. I originally planned to wait until I broke through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, then deal with you one by one&mdash;either make you submit to the Royal Family or eliminate you directly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But now, that's no longer necessary!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Today, I will kill all of you here, then leave this place and completely destroy your sects."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the territory of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, no force threatening the Royal Family is allowed to exist."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you all must die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick's killing intent surged even more. He no longer hid his true purpose and revealed his plan to everyone without reservation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This showed that he didn't care if these words would spread, because he was confident enough to eliminate everyone present.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the warriors of various forces turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A warrior from a major force said, "Frederick, I think you've completely lost your mind!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's fine if you've gone mad, but don't drag us to our deaths with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked grim and quickly retreated with his disciples.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His speed was incredible as he dashed straight toward the massive black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that as long as he passed through the black vortex, he could leave Necropolis City and enter the normal cosmos. By then, no matter how powerful Frederick was, it would be impossible to trap them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as he dashed toward the black vortex, Frederick suddenly punched it fiercely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The black vortex instantly raged violently, unleashing terrifying power that shredded the warrior attempting to escape through it in an instant.</span></p></div>
