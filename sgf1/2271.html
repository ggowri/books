        <h1>Chapter 2236 Celestial Progeny-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class SS!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no question that Clarissa had also scored a Class SS in the Astral Testing Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela, Amber, and the others were already immune to the shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They themselves had only managed to achieve a Class S in the test. Back then, their teachers had pulled out all the stops to track them down, scouring the Racial Convergence Planet and putting in innumerable hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd once been so chuffed about their Class S talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, out of the blue, a whole bunch of Class SS super prodigies had popped up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was beyond unfair!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, reality was staring at them in the face. No matter how preposterous it seemed, the results were set in stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma, Austin</span><span>,</span><span> and Anita took their turns in the Astral Testing Arch, and every single one of them came out with a Class SS score.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, even Angela was getting antsy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She egged on Anastasia, Zoe</span><span>,</span><span> and Mila to give the Astral Testing Arch a go, hoping for a different twist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But lo and behold, the result was still Class SS!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, among all those present, only Isa and Osborne hadn't stepped into the Astral Testing Arch yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They just stood there, showing no sign of wanting to take the test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela and Amber shot each other a confused look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew full well that Osborne was the one in charge, while Isa boasted the highest cultivation level among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If everyone else had scored Class SS, it was reasonable to assume that Isa and Osborne's talents and potential would be equally impressive, if not better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, they seemed uninterested in testing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela and her fellow practitioners quickly began to communicate through their thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gwen exclaimed, her excitement palpable, "This is ridiculous! It's just too absurd!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those ten or so people are unbelievable! Everyone who's been tested so far has scored Class SS! I've never seen anything like it! They're not even from the Sacred Dragon Clan or Sacred Tiger Clan&mdash;how can they all be Class SS?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela said in agreement, "It really is outrageous! I can't wrap my head around it! Do you think there's something wrong with the Astral Testing Arch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeley interjected, "Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angela, before you reached out to me, I was actually overseeing a recruitment event! The Astral Testing Arch has been in use, and most of the disciples tested were Class C or Class B. Even Class A scores were rare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can assure you, there's nothing wrong with the Astral Testing Arch! The issue lies with these kids... they're simply favored by the heavens!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amber piped up then. "The Astral Testing Arch is in perfect working order! I've got a hunch that might just explain what's going on here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes zeroed in on her. Angela, Keeley, and Gwen were practically on the edge of their </span><span>seats</span><span>, dying to hear more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amber, spill the beans. What's your hunch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amber stole a glance at Isa and Osborne, her face </span><span>dead serious</span><span>. "I've got a sneaking suspicion that one of them is a Celestial Progeny."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Celestial Progeny?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela, Keeley, and Gwen let out gasps of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above the Class SS is the Class SSS, and the prodigies who made it to the Class SSS were known as Celestial </span><span>Progenies</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Celestial Progeny was more than just a title; they were the favored children of the cosmos, gifted with extraordinary potential and destiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These rare individuals were predestined to become some of the most powerful beings in existence&mdash;provided they didn't falter along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With seemingly minimal effort, they could rapidly ascend through the ranks of cultivation. A mere thought could enable them to grasp formidable combat techniques, harnessing abilities that others could only dream of. They stood shoulder to shoulder with the elite talents from Apex Clans, such as the illustrious Sacred Dragon Clan and the mighty Sacred Tiger Clan, possessing a prowess that set them apart in any arena.</span></p></div>
