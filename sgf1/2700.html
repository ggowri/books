        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman agreed, "That's right. His strength is remarkable. Ordinary warriors at the primary Empyrean Sacredness level are definitely no match for him. He can even challenge some warriors at the mid Empyrean Sacredness level. But how many moves can he withstand in front of Princess Seraphina?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another man scoffed, "A few moves? I think Princess Seraphina can defeat him in just one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman said, "That's impossible, right? I think it would take at least three moves. After all, they're at the same cultivation level. Even though Princess Seraphina is strong, she can't be ridiculously overpowered. Based on Mason's displayed strength, I believe even ordinary warriors at the advanced Empyrean Sacredness level would struggle to defeat him in one move. Even if Princess Seraphina is very powerful, she surely isn't stronger than warriors at the advanced Empyrean Sacredness level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man smiled and said, "We'll see about that. You have no idea how powerful Princess Seraphina is. I think that among all the participants in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, no one can withstand Princess Seraphina's three moves, except for the other princesses and princes. If you don't believe me, just watch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd whispered among themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was also watching the battle on the stage, his expression very calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were also watching the battle intently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all curious about how strong Seraphina, ranked first in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, and Mason, ranked tenth, truly were.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching the battle between these two would give them a clearer understanding of their own skill levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, their strength had greatly increased after using the Legendary Dragon Elixir. However, they hadn't had the chance to spar with anyone, so they had no idea what level their strength was at now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina calmly said, "Come on! Let me show you the gap between us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She then gestured to Mason. "You attack first. Otherwise, you won't get the chance to attack."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Mason's expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's words were too arrogant, but he couldn't refute them because Seraphina ranked first in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, seeing Seraphina holding nothing, Mason awkwardly said, "Princess Seraphina, aren't you going to take out your Sacred Artifact? Do you intend to fight me barehanded?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina smiled faintly and said, "If I feel your strength is enough to require me to use my Sacred Artifact, of course, I will take it out. But for now, you're not worthy of it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, her words caused an uproar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman said in shock, "Princess Seraphina is too confident. Facing Mason, who ranks tenth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, she doesn't even use her Sacred Artifact and lets Mason attack first. They can't use any Defensive Sacred Artifact, so one mistake could lead to elimination."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man scoffed and said, "Is she confident or just arrogant?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason gritted his teeth and said, "Princess Seraphina, since you're so careless and don't take me seriously, don't blame me. Let me see how you plan to handle me barehanded."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Mason launched his attack directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Artifact in his hand was a Legendary Sacred Artifact. After years of practice, he could already unleash part of its power on his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this portion of power far surpassed the strength of a Superior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is why he ranked tenth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Broke it!" Mason shouted as his attack furiously charged toward Seraphina, instantly enveloping her and sealing off all her escape routes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason's eyes were filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Defensive Sacred Artifacts were not allowed in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, it gave him a chance to defeat the strong while being weaker. After all, even if his strength was inferior to Seraphina's, he could still break through her defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't believe Seraphina could block his attack bare-handed without getting hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, his expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's expression was calm. Just as the attack was about to hit her, she gently threw a punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Mason's strongest attack, unleashed with the Legendary Sacred Artifact, was instantly shattered by Seraphina. Seraphina's fist power, even without losing speed, continued to surge toward Mason.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason could feel that he was locked on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to escape, also to dodge, but he simply couldn't. In an instant, he was struck by the terrifying fist power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, Mason spat out blood frantically and then fell off the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro announced, "The first group's top rank is Princess Seraphina, and the second is Mason. Now, contestants from the second group, please come to the stage for the battle."</span></p></div>
