        <h1>Chapter 2578 I Surrender</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Leroy directly blocked Osborne, looking at Brenda provocatively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's intention was very clear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "You want to face Osborne? Defeat me first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda, haven't you always thought that I only got Osborne's help by luck to stand out in the zone duel and win second place? Now, fight me, defeat me, and reclaim your honor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy continued to provoke Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's face was very grim. She angrily said, "You want to defeat me too? You're overestimating yourself! I don't believe you can improve as much as Clara!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, I'll defeat you first, then Osborne, and finally Clara!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will prove that I am the strongest under Empyrean Sacredness in Eastern Zone 3!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Brenda launched an attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, aside from Defensive Sacred Artifacts, those Sacred Artifacts infused with power by warriors are also prohibited from use.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, if Brenda used a Supreme Sacred Artifact infused with power by her elders, she would be invincible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, this time she is using a Superior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because, with Brenda's strength, she cannot wield a Legendary Sacred Artifact, so she can only use a Superior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she feels that this is enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy comes from a Second-rate Power. Brenda suspects that Leroy doesn't even have a Superior Sacred Artifact, and Brenda feels that being able to fully unleash the power of a Superior Sacred Artifact makes her very powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Leroy let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought for a moment and unexpectedly took out her previously used Inferno Drake Lance instead of the Legendary Sacred Artifact Spear given to her by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the Inferno Drake Lance is just an Inferior Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Brenda saw that Leroy was using just an Inferior Sacred Artifact, she immediately let out a cold laugh, her eyes filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, she was genuinely afraid that Leroy, like Clara, would also wield a Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Brenda knew her worries were unnecessary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Inferior Sacred Artifact? How ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy sneered, "Inferior Sacred Artifact? So what? It's enough to defeat you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then give it a try!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda wasted no time, unleashing her power and wielding her Sacred Artifact. Instantly, a burst of frost erupted, engulfing Leroy and Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Freeze!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy sneered, "You think you can freeze me with ice power? Ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Leroy unleashed his power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thrust her Inferno Drake Lance forward fiercely. Instantly, a terrifying Emberdrake Wraith surged out. It seemed to come alive, twisting as it lunged at Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Emberdrake Wraith ignored the ice power and charged forward. All the ice power vanished instantly, unable to resist the Emberdrake Wraith.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda is far less powerful than Yvonne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's strength is comparable to Clara, who defeated Yvonne. Even if Leroy uses the most basic Inferior Sacred Artifact instead of a Legendary Sacred Artifact, the power she unleashes is terrifying and far beyond what Brenda can withstand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's attack vanished instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's Emberdrake Wraith grew stronger, engulfing Brenda's vision in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda panicked, her face filled with disbelief. Feeling the terrifying power of Leroy's Emberdrake Wraith, she actually trembled, overwhelmed by fear and shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Destroy it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda frantically unleashed her ice power, trying to resist Leroy's Emberdrake Wraith, but it was completely useless. The Emberdrake Wraith was too powerful, shattering and obliterating all of Brenda's strength. In the end, the Emberdrake Wraith charged straight through where she stood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A piercing scream echoed. Brenda, utterly battered and charred, was flung backward and crashed heavily beneath the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She lost!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy defeated Brenda in one move using the Inferior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't accept it, forcing herself to lift her head despite the pain, unwillingly staring at Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy looked at her too, full of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She mocked, "You think you can be the strongest under the Empyrean Sacredness of Eastern Zone 3? You can't even beat me, yet you want to face Osborne. Do you deserve it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne said you're not even in the top three of Eastern Zone 3!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Accept your fate!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's face instantly turned red, then she spat out a mouthful of blood and fainted in anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy couldn't be bothered with Brenda anymore. Her strength was different now. During the zone duel, Brenda was an unbeatable supreme warrior in her eyes. But now, Brenda was no match for her!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or rather, Brenda was too weak!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's target was no longer opponents like Brenda but the princes and princesses of the Royal Family!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she now had to advance from the group stage first!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy looked at the other eight people in Group Ten and said, "Attack me all at once!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all frowned, feeling as if they had been insulted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy was the last place in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when they thought about Clara, who was tied for last place, defeating Yvonne, and Leroy defeating Brenda in one move, they calmed down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy was likely just like Clara, a super promising contender in this Glorious Divine War!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they fought Leroy one-on-one, they definitely wouldn't be her match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that she gave them a chance to attack together, they didn&rsquo;t want to miss it. As long as they could defeat her as a team, they had a shot at making the top twenty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone shouted sternly, "Leroy, this is what you said yourself, not us ganging up on you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy laughed, "Of course, I said it myself! Bring it on!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn&rsquo;t want these people to bother Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, there were no princes or princesses in this group, making it less thrilling for her. She wanted to feel some pressure to test her strength, which is why she let them attack her together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Defeat her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the remaining eight people unleashed their strongest attacks on Leroy without holding back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, eight terrifying attacks engulfed her, exuding an intimidating aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, she still didn't feel any pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These people are too weak!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy understood why the princes and princesses of the Royal Family were so proud, confident, and even arrogant, dismissing other ordinary contestants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For those as powerful as them, other ordinary contestants are indeed weak!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You will be the losers!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy thrust the Inferno Drake Lance once again. Several Emberdrake Wraiths burst forth, instantly shattering all surrounding attacks, then charged toward the eight opponents. No matter how they attacked, defended, or dodged, it was all useless. They were caught by the Emberdrake Wraiths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately after, they were defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Emberdrake Wraiths flashed by. In the end, only Leroy and Osborne were left on the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone looked at Leroy with utter surprise and shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned her head with a smile and looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through Telepathy, she said, "Alright, I took care of them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now I'll concede. You take first place in the group, and I'll take second!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Leroy was about to leave the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew there was still an enormous gap between her and Osborne, so there was no need for them to fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, she was stopped by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through Telepathy, Osborne replied, "No! You take first place in the group, and I'll take second!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll concede!"</span></p></div>
