        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashes of Death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Medusa Queens unleashed their petrification power, a terrifying force that weighed heavily on Osborne, making his body feel as if it were solidifying into stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted into a grimace as he struggled against the effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a Class AAA Duke Medusa, Ashes of Death was a one-time trump card, exhausting their energy and rendering them powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Class S Medusa Queens, it was just another weapon in their arsenal, one they could use repeatedly to torment Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he fought against the petrification creeping through his veins, Bradley, Scarlett, and Marlon seized the moment, launching a flurry of attacks, determined to take him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through gritted teeth, Osborne focused all his strength on defense, but the pressure was mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on Mount Celestial Reach, another fierce battle raged. The elders of the Augustine family, accompanied by five of Sebastian's maids, were locked in combat with the Class S powerhouse, Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they numbered over a dozen, all Class AAA, their combined strength was formidable, but they faced an opponent far more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett wasn't just any Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was listed on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings, even if he held the lowest position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just being on that list marked him as a top-tier Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the elders attacked, Everett remained unfazed, his calm demeanor a stark contrast to the chaos around him. "Pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous roar, he unleashed a wave of power that sent the elders flying. They were no match for his strength, their faces paling in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Form up!" Serena shouted, rallying the four maids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly took their positions, forming a pentagram that pulsed with energy, connecting them in a powerful formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, their strength surged, surpassing the typical Class S level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A formation? Glacium's martial arts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, "Too bad your power is still too weak. Even with that formation, you won't stand a chance against me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare to be defeated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An even greater force erupted from Everett, descending upon Serena and the others like a storm. But they stood resolute, channeling their combined strength to push back against his onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash created a shockwave that sent the Augustine family elders reeling, while Serena and her companions struggled to maintain their formation, their faces turning pale as the strain threatened to overwhelm them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett, taken aback by their resilience, raised an eyebrow in curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive! Let's see how long you can hold out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he launched a relentless barrage of attacks against their formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each strike was met with resistance, but the maids' faces grew increasingly ashen, their bodies trembling as they fought to stay upright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cruel smile crept onto Everett's face, his eyes glinting with malice. "I'm going to crush you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, high in the skies, Wesson and three elderly women were locked in a fierce battle against Rumen, a top-tier Class S warrior ranked in the top fifty of the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even against four Class S opponents, Rumen remained calm, exuding an air of indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The gap between Class S fighters is far greater than that between Class A and S. I'm the pinnacle of Class S, while you're just average!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Against me, you don't stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of his wrist, Rumen sent Wesson flying, blood spilling from the corner of his mouth as he crashed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I kill you all, every last bit of the Augustine family's assets, including the Draco Group, will belong to the League of Divine Descent. The Thornberry family will have it all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen struck again, sending the three Class S elders flying back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat with disdain, saying, "Without Sebastian, you're all nothing but trash! Even if he were here, he'd still end up as my defeated foe. Compared to me, Godfather? Nothing! Absolutely nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he finished, Wesson and the three elder women's faces twisted in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you dare insult Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four charged at Rumen with all their fury, but rage couldn't bridge the gap in their power. Rumen effortlessly knocked them back once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed, a chuckle escaping his throat. "So what if I insult him? What are you going to do about it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without Sebastian, you're just a bunch of nobodies. I'm done wasting my time with you. You can all die now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Rumen's attacks intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Already struggling, Wesson and the others found themselves overwhelmed. Blood poured from their mouths as they were battered relentlessly, each blow pushing them closer to death's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, meanwhile, managed to push back the enemies surrounding him, but as he looked toward the other two battlefields, his expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family forces were collapsing everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all falling apart.</span></p></div>
