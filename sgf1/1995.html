        <h1>Chapter 1992 A Battle to the Death-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were the one who doubted that the Hudson family betrayed the Human Community, accusing me of not submitting the list of Hudson family geniuses. Now </span><span>God of Light</span><span> has cleared that up and proven our case, and you still want me to explain myself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I? Who says the Hudson family can't have this kind of power? Are you upset because our strength is growing? Can't handle it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's voice was cold, cutting through the air, and Julian's face flushed a deep red, his anger rising to the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jethro, you're asking for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you talk to me like that? You think just because the Hudson family's hiding its strength, you can stand up to HeartUnited Alliance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span>'s sharp voice cut through the tension like a whip. "Julian, you're out of line! I've already given you the explanation you wanted. As for why the Hudson family's strength is so much greater than you thought... they don't owe you or anyone else an explanation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, this is great news for the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's not bring this up again. Everyone can rest easy&mdash;I'll select the participants for the border competition fairly and impartially. People from Sanctum of Light will also be involved, fighting alongside us for the dignity of the Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Julian quickly dropped his head, silenced, no longer daring to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, the first border competition is about to begin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, let's head to the viewing area!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, </span><span>God of Light</span><span> shot a meaningful glance at Julian and Jethro before leading the group toward a massive platform belonging to the Sanctum of Light, gazing off toward the distant viewing platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The competition on that platform was about to kick off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian finally lifted his head, a cold glint flashing deep in his eyes. He shot one last, piercing look at Jethro before turning his attention to the viewing platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro didn't acknowledge Julian. He, too, focused his gaze on the distant platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal viewing platform overlooked a vast battlefield stretching over 300 miles in every direction. On either side of the field stood two groups of warriors, each radiating a fierce, oppressive energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the left were ten thousand Transcendent Deity-level geniuses from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the right stood ten thousand Transcendent Deity-level geniuses from the Unity Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were separated by a great distance but locked in a fierce stare-off, each pair of eyes burning with battle intent, icy killing intent simmering just beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the battlefield below, hundreds of billions of Human Community forces and the Dark Deity Legion had all looked up toward the viewing platform. Their voices roared in unison, echoing across the field. The overwhelming bloodlust and battle fervor reverberated through the air, shaking the earth itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the massive projection of the Icy One appeared again. His eyes fixed on the group from the Sanctum of Light, a cruel smile tugging at the corners of his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The time has come. What do you think, </span><span>God of Light</span><span>? Is it time to start the first border competition?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, </span><span>God of Light</span><span> nodded slightly and said coolly, "Then let it begin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her words echoed through the air, the surrounding cheers grew even louder, more frenzied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill! Eradicate the worthless Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight! Bring glory to the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unity Clan will win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human Community, rise up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the chaos of shouts, the ten thousand Transcendent Deity-level geniuses from the Human Community and the ten thousand from the Unity Clan all began to move in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The border competition had begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first match was a Transcendent Deity-level showdown!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two groups, twenty thousand peak Transcendent Deity-level warriors in total, each one a genius among geniuses, charged toward each other at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the battle erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collision of twenty thousand Transcendent Deity-level warriors was nothing short of cataclysmic. Fierce, brutal attacks were exchanged, and in a matter of seconds, the battlefield was soaked in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a battle to the death&mdash;a brutal, unrelenting bloodbath.</span></p></div>
