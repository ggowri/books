        <h1>Chapter 2243 The Tournament Begins-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone scoffed loudly, drawing attention from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dark horse? Ha! What dark horse could possibly emerge? The strength of Vadim, Jamar, and Bethan clearly puts them in a league of their own! After all, they've all faced countless super talents in the state duel ten years ago. Even if a dark horse did show up, just making it into the top ten would be an achievement. Challenging those three? That's just wishful thinking! I honestly don't believe anyone can pull that off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many around him nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vadim, Jamar, and Bethan are indeed the strongest disciples in Mystic Sirius Sect! Sure, everyone else is at Ascension Ten, but their power is on a whole different level. It's going to be tough for anyone to take them on," a second voice added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But outside of those three, the competition for the top ten is going to be fierce! Peak Four and Five have some impressive talents showing up, and even Peak Six and Eight have contenders who could make a run for it," someone else said, excitement creeping into his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! That just leaves Peak Seven and Peak Nine with no hope whatsoever! I mean, come on, there's no way their disciples can even dream of making it into the top ten. They'll be lucky to crack the top twenty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard the core disciples from Peak Seven are total cowards. They're too chicken-hearted to enter the tournament. They're terrified of getting humiliated! They couldn't even manage to fill all thirty tournament slots, so they had to scrounge up some inner disciples to pad out the roster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Inner disciples? Are they just here to embarrass themselves? Without an Ascension Ten cultivation level, competing in the Sect Tournament is just a joke," someone else said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was buzzing with gossip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their words made the faces of the Peak Seven participants turn sour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne and Maddox finally reached the arena. Eyeing the bustling scene, Osborne gave a faint smile and sauntered over to where the Peak Seven participants were standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whipped out his Kingdom </span><span>Duel</span><span> Token. In an instant, all the Peak Seven participants swiveled their heads towards Osborne, their eyes brimming with bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a single one of them had a clue who Osborne was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you an inner disciple?" one of them asked, eyebrow raised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Yeah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying a word more, he made a beeline for a quiet nook and plopped down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he shut his eyes and went into a meditative state. His nonchalant act only rubbed the nearby disciple the wrong way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! An inner disciple thinks he can just brush us core disciples off? What a lack of respect! Being so full of himself is just asking for a beating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disciple snorted and stomped over to Osborne, itching for a confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another disciple jumped in, blocking the angry one's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa, hold your horses! He's a face I don't recognize. He must be new around here. Right now, the whole place is making fun of us from Peak Seven. If we start fighting among ourselves, they'll have a field day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't forget, Ms. Olsen and the Elders are watching! If you start a ruckus, you'll just make a fool of yourself, and Ms. Olsen won't cut you any slack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The angry disciple's face changed as he took in these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot Osborne a dirty look. "You got lucky today. I'm letting you off the hook for now, but you better come crawling back and beg for my forgiveness later! Otherwise, you'll be sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words echoed, but Osborne didn't seem to bat an eye like he couldn't even hear them.</span></p></div>
