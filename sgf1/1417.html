        <h1>Chapter 1416 Perfect Disguise</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, Osborne could easily reshape his bones and facial contours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, his physique already resembled Lachlan's quite a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he focused, his facial features transformed rapidly, soon becoming a perfect match for Lachlan's. Even Albert and Laird, Lachlan's own subordinates, wouldn't be able to spot the differences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the mere physical resemblance wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most challenging aspect to alter was the signature of divine power, a signature that was unique to every individual. Even if two people possessed the same type of power and practiced identical techniques, their power signatures would exhibit considerable differences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those familiar with Lachlan would easily sense the discrepancies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was precisely how the Dark Deity Legion's Spirit Tracer tracked down Harry and Amelia&mdash;by exploiting the unique divine signature of each person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, a power signature is specific and unchangeable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, completely masquerading as someone else seemed nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had the advantage of the Eclipsing Mantra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once one reached Level Four, it allowed for the perfect alteration of their divine power signature to mimic that of another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne's Eclipsing Mantra had only reached Level Three, he didn't find it daunting, as he considered mastering it straightforward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne began a temporary training session.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than an hour, he successfully raised his Eclipsing Mantra to Level Four, causing his divine power signature to shift dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, the Divine Flame atop his head began to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, as a Superior Deity, Osborne had regained only Intermediate Deity strength. This meant he had three Divine Flames, but only two of them were lit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Lachlan, being a Transcendent Deity warrior, boasted four Divine Flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne wanted to convincingly impersonate Lachlan, he needed to alter the number of Divine Flames he had. After advancing the Eclipsing Mantra to Level Four, this posed no challenge for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, four Divine Flames flickered to life above Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, they remained transparent, but Lachlan's Divine Flames were a soft green due to his Level Four Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mental command, Osborne changed their color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four luminescent, pale green flames ignited above him, burning steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To complete his transformation, Osborne stripped off Lachlan's garments and donned them himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, he fully became Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert, Laird, Jaxton, Darnell, and Arlen were left speechless, their eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you see any differences?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing his voice wasn't quite like Lachlan's, he cleared his throat and tried again. "How about now? Any differences?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five exchanged glances, scrutinizing Osborne intently. Eventually, they shook their heads in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord. No difference whatsoever! If we didn't feel the ancestral aura coming from you, we'd honestly think you were the real Lachlan! We're certain that no one else would detect any discrepancies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face split into a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect! From now on, I'll be Lachlan. Don't call me Lord any longer; it might blow my cover. Just refer to me as Mr. Swift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Swift!" they responded, nodding seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, our mission to capture Harry, Amelia, and Osborne turned into an unexpected encounter with a horde of Deathborn. While we managed to kill Osborne and capture Harry and Amelia, we also lost four members to the Deathborn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five nodded in agreement. "Mr. Swift, we remember!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! Stay here, I'll go bring our 'captive,' then we can head back to Wild Flame City," Osborne replied, his body seamlessly merging into the rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Osborne arrived at the hiding spot of Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both looked grim, despair still etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry, it's been a long time since Osborne left. Do you think something happened to him?" Amelia worriedly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry, despite his own worries, comforted her, "Don't worry, Osborne isn't as simple as we think. He easily killed Patrick. He's way stronger than us; he'll be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Harry's expression hardened abruptly, his eyes widening in shock at the figure emerging from the rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the attire and the four Divine Flames on the newcomer's head, he panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Transcendent Deity warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan!" Harry exclaimed, shielding his sister Amelia behind him, his eyes filled with hopelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Lachlan has come for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry had heard of Lachlan's cruelty. Despite being a native human of Celestara, Lachlan's ruthlessness towards his own kind surpassed even other Dark Deity races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the villages of this mining region feared and loathed Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him now, Harry knew their fate was sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would likely be tortured to death by Lachlan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Harry's eyes flashed with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand swiftly, aiming at his own head, unwilling to face the torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Amelia, with a look of resolute defiance, said, "Harry, see you in the next life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, she glared hatefully at "Lachlan" before raising her hand to her own head, ready to end her life.</span></p></div>
