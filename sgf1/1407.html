        <h1>Chapter 1406 Spirit Tracer</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Swift, we've locked onto the divine power signatures of Harry Rodriguez and Amelia Rodriguez based on the database. They're currently fleeing deeper into the mine, and they're moving fast. It seems they've found an undocumented secret passage leading further down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to catch up with them, but first, we have to locate this secret route," said the man holding the Spirit Tracer, addressing Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan scoffed. "As miners, they dare to kill and run? Don't they realize their divine power signatures have already been cataloged by the Ninth Dark Deity Legion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Spirit Tracer can easily track their location. Unless they manage to escape over six thousand miles, there's no way they can hide from it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if they've discovered a secret way into the mine, that complicates things. The rock down here is too tough; even we'd struggle to carve out a new tunnel to chase them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So let's find their secret passage. How long will it take?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man with the Spirit Tracer replied calmly, "I've already instructed the device to capture the residual divine power signatures from the air and analyze their escape route. If all goes well, we should pinpoint the secret passage in about half a day. If not, it might take a full day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan nodded, a cold smile creeping onto his face. "A day, you say? Let them live another day, then. The entire mining area is sealed off by the Spirit Tracer; they can't slip away unnoticed. Let's give them another day to stew in their fear. Find that secret tunnel quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man with the Spirit Tracer immediately began to operate the device.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blurred path gradually appeared on the Spirit Tracer's screen, revealing the direction Harry and Amelia had taken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, deep in the mine, Harry, Amelia, and Osborne had reached the secret tunnel, standing at the site of the newly discovered high-grade ore vein.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry, hiding here should keep us off the radar, right? Even the Ninth Dark Deity Legion would have a hard time finding us. We could just stay put," Amelia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's expression was tense, his lips pressed together in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, noticing Harry's troubled demeanor, couldn't help but ask, "Harry, is there something wrong with Amelia's plan? Can't we hide here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, Harry finally spoke, "No, we can't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If hiding deep in the mine was a viable option to escape the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, I would've done it ages ago. Countless miners have tried to find refuge down here. Sure, there's a chance we might face Deathborn attacks, but it's still better than being slaves to the Ninth Dark Deity Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's just not feasible. Every miner here has had their divine power signatures collected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard whispers about a device they have, the Spirit Tracer. It can lock onto our divine power signatures within a six-thousand-mile radius and pinpoint our locations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So even if we hide in the depths of the mine, they'll eventually track us down. It's only a matter of time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's face went pale at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what? Is that really true? What do we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry sighed again, the weight of despair settling on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've told you before, there's no way out for us! That's why even overseers like Patrick, no matter how cruel or unjust, go unchallenged."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In East Zone Nine, anyone who dares to stand against the Ninth Dark Deity Legion is walking a path to certain death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Harry's eyes, despair was written clear as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stood there, stunned, her mind racing with the grim reality that the Ninth Dark Deity Legion was closing in. The thought of being caught, executed, or even tortured to death filled her with the same desolation as Harry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, wore a faint smile. He mused, "Spirit Tracer? Locking onto divine power signatures? That's a nifty trick! Reminds me a bit of Kendra's abilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But let's be clear: Kendra's got it beat hands down. She can memorize the power signatures of anyone she lays eyes on, no matter their consent, and find them no matter where they hide. Spirit Tracer? It's got a measly six thousand miles of range."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra's the real deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's thoughts drifted to Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had accompanied him to Celestara, but an accident had stranded her in the Dimensional Microcosm. Osborne knew he had to revive the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and make its petals bloom anew if they were to be freed from the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gotta speed up the revival process," he mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, noticing Osborne's unshaken resolve, couldn't help but question, "Osborne, aren't you scared? The Ninth Dark Deity Legion is gonna catch up and kill us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why be scared? Don't sweat it. We're not going down that easily."</span></p></div>
