        <h1>Chapter 1588 Wild Flame City in Chaos</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman and Laird were both peak Deity Overlords&mdash;the strongest powers just beneath the Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the Deity King rarely making an appearance, these two were the top forces in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, both were absolutely furious at each other. One believed the other had nearly crippled his beloved son, while the other believed that his cherished mistress had been violated by that very son. Hatred and a thirst for revenge consumed them both; all they wanted was to end each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this state, they attacked with everything they had, and their overwhelming power erupted across Wild Flame City, instantly alarming half the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People stared in shock, watching the battle unfold from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But neither of them cared&mdash;they just kept attacking like madmen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their strengths were evenly matched&mdash;one was a general of the Wild Flame Army, the other a general of the City Guard. A battle like this hadn't happened in Wild Flame City for ages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At first, they tried to keep it under control, avoiding damage to the city buildings. But as time went on, they threw all caution to the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom! Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense battle raged from the western side of the city all the way to the eastern side, and then out beyond the city walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost every major faction in Wild Flame City was alerted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rumors spread quickly among them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Herman Saxton and Laird Borden are fighting? Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?! Laird almost crippled Herman's son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait&mdash;Herman's son messed with Laird's woman on the west side of the city?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Laird sent his men to assassinate Herman's son, but they got caught?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Laird not only hurt Herman's son, but also took down several other young talents and elites from different factions? Now everyone's getting involved?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Herman's got solid proof?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Laird has solid proof too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Saxton family and the Borden family are at each other's throats, both swearing they won't rest until the other is destroyed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even the Swift family from the Soaring Lion Clan is in on this now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wild Flame Army and City Guard are..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Herman and Laird's fight, there was no turning back. They were way past any kind of peaceful resolution, both convinced the other was at fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And just as Osborne had hoped, things spiraled out of control in just three days. The Saxton and Borden families completely turned against each other, escalating into an even bigger conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Word had it that even the Deity Kings from both families met for a duel in the wilderness&mdash;neither side managed to win, but neither was willing to let things end there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More and more factions got dragged into the chaos. Wild Flame City's Hundred Clans were all forced to pick sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the relationship between the Wild Flame Army and the City Guard grew tense, with fights breaking out more and more often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, Wild Flame City was in utter chaos!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In all of this, nobody paid attention to the Spark of Blaze or Osborne anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quietly got promoted to centurion, and no one even noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this time, Osborne also quietly visited Murray's camp. With Murray's help, Osborne used the same method to transform all ten thousand Wild Flame Army soldiers under Murray's command into Vampires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Out of the fifty thousand soldiers in the Wild Flame Army, Osborne now controlled over twenty thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was these twenty thousand soldiers, subtly adding fuel to the fire, that escalated the conflict between the Wild Flame Army and the City Guard until it swept through the entire city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Osborne stood on the tallest building of Spark Estate, gazing out at the streets of Wild Flame City. The roads were deserted, the buildings lay in ruins, and a cold smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keep fighting! The more you tear each other apart, the better. Take down a few more major factions while you're at it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nobody could have imagined that the chaos engulfing nearly every faction in Wild Flame City was orchestrated by Osborne Augustine from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And it all started with his attempt to get promoted to centurion&mdash;an attempt denied by Herman Saxton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My lord, are you really leaving Wild Flame City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Betty approached Osborne, speaking softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Yeah, I've been selected to join the Wild Flame Army support unit heading to Divine Peak Nine. Two days from now, I'll be leaving the city."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to look at Betty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Things are pretty crazy in Wild Flame City right now, so you all should stay put at Spark Estate. I've left you enough Essence Crystals&mdash;focus on getting stronger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My lord, just be careful, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave her a faint smile. "Got it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he started heading back to the Wild Flame Army camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just then, Hannah Gellar showed up unannounced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment she saw Osborne, she hurried over, her face full of worry. "Osborne, are you really going to Divine Peak Nine? It's way too dangerous there! Can't you avoid going? If you say no, I can use my connections to get your name off the list!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Osborne, her concern written all over her face.</span></p></div>
