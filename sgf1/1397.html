        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, is that... mid-grade Essence Crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye detected a small vein of minerals nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this vein was relatively modest and the density of Essence Crystals was lower than that of surrounding deposits, every crystal within it radiated a purer, more potent energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike the dark brown Essence </span><span>Crystals</span><span> he had encountered before, these glimmered with a soft blue light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it really be mid-grade Essence Crystals?" Osborne pondered, uncertainty creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never seen mid-grade Essence Crystals before, but he was certain these were not low-grade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This vein might be small, but it still holds over 10 thousand crystals. With my Satan's Eye pinpointing their location and my earth elemental power to navigate the mine, I could extract them all in under an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten thousand mid-grade Essence Crystals are equivalent to a million low-grade ones! For Harry, an Intermediate Deity, he only needs to submit a thousand low-grade Essence Crystals each month. A million would cover his contributions for eighty years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's enough mid-grade Essence Crystals to help dozens of Superior Deities break through to Transcendent Deity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his injuries hadn't fully healed yet and he didn't need Essence Crystals at the moment, he knew he would require a vast quantity in the future. Even if Osborne couldn't use them himself, they could be saved for Sebastian, Anastasia, Zoe, and even the Augustine family still on Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Essence Crystals served as the currency in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything in this place came at a cost, and once he recovered and left Rodriguez Village, he would undoubtedly find a use for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Low-grade Essence Crystals weren't worth his time to mine, but mid-grade ones? Those were a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me take some time to gather them all!" he decided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within two hours, Osborne had extracted all the mid-grade Essence Crystals from the vein, which totaled over 12 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carefully stored them in his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, to hunt down more Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>! I can feel my strength returning&mdash;I'm on the verge of regaining my Junior Deity status!" Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stowed away the Eclipsing Mantra, and three translucent Divine Flames flickered above his head, representing his past achievement as a Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, these flames were mere shadows of their former glory, dim and lifeless due to his severe injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, thanks to the recovery of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, one of the Divine Flames began to show signs of reigniting. Osborne estimated that if he could take down a few more Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> and let the Lotus absorb their high-grade death scent, the first Divine Flame would truly reignite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that happened, he would reclaim his Junior Deity status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his skills and power, even at that level, he would be more than a match for an ordinary Superior Deity and might even come out on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep pushing forward!" Osborne urged himself, determined to find more Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With hope rekindled, he refused to waste a single moment, eager to restore his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he encountered another Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then a second, and a third.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three hours passed, and after delving deeper into the mine for over eight hours, Osborne had slain eleven Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>. He ensured that the high-grade death scent left behind by each was absorbed by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast network of roots from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity surged back to life, pulsating with renewed vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their assistance, Osborne felt a significant recovery in his Divine Body. Among the three dim Divine Flames flickering above his head, one finally reignited with a resounding pop, bursting into brilliant flames once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of relief washed over him as the familiar sensation of power surged back, almost intoxicating in its intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've finally regained my Junior Deity status!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, Junior Deity might be the lowest rank, but my version of it is different. I'm not your average Junior Deity; I can take on a Superior Deity without breaking a sweat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time to head back. If Harry and Amelia return and don't find me, they're going to be worried sick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne decided to return for now, planning to continue his hunt tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was eager to explore the deeper levels of the mine, where he could confront even stronger Superior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>. The high-grade death scent from those powerful foes would be purer and more potent, allowing the Lotus to recover even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was falling into a positive cycle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as nothing went awry, he felt confident he could fully restore his strength in the coming days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to go!" Osborne said to himself, making his way back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he passed by the area where Harry and Amelia were mining, he was surprised to see that the siblings hadn't returned yet; they were still hard at work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were situated in a small vein of their own, where the density of Essence Crystals was surprisingly high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every so often, they unearthed a low-grade Essence Crystal, their faces lighting up </span><span>with excitement each time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their enthusiasm sparked a thought in Osborne's mind.</span></p></div>
