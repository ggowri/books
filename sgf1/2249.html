        <h1>Chapter 2222 Defeating Bancroft</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King dares to challenge me? Talk about asking for death!" Bancroft scoffed, his disdain evident as he recognized Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next moment, his expression froze. Osborne's punch shattered Bancroft's attack effortlessly, and he didn't even budge an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?!" Bancroft was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the supreme warrior of Necoton Planet, he took great pride in his vast experience. He had witnessed numerous talented warriors from neighboring small life-bearing planets and micro-life planets. All of them passed through his domain on their way to the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed he had seen enough prodigies to tell the real deal from the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his view, those so-called geniuses from the smaller planets were nothing compared to the true wunderkinder of the Racial Convergence Planet. Once they got there, they'd be just another face in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the geniuses on the Racial Convergence Planet wouldn't have dared to confront him head-on when they were at the Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King stage back then. There had been a staggering three-cultivation-level gap, and a mere difference in talent couldn't have compensated for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne, an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, had just effortlessly deflected his attack? It was almost too much to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True, he hadn't used his full strength, but neither had Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft's attitude changed instantly. "Just who the hell are you? Are you one of those top students from the Racial Convergence Planet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and said, "My identity isn't the issue here! What matters is, who's pulling your strings? If you spill the beans now, I might let you live. Otherwise, don't come crying when things go south!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft's temper flared up. "You arrogant little punk! Just because you've got a bit of power doesn't mean you can swagger around here! If you're itching for a fight, you've come to the right place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter who you are, I'll take you down and bury you without anyone ever finding out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me show you what I'm really made of!" Bancroft roared, and his attacks grew even more savage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd reached the Ascension Ten level over a millennium ago. Once he got into the fight for real, Osborne could feel the pressure mounting like never before. It was a whole lot worse than when he faced Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, he was already at Ascension Seven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne were still at Ascension Four, he'd be no match for Bancroft. He'd have to fight like a cornered animal just to have a slim chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne let out a disdainful grunt and didn't bat an eye before pulling out the Bloodwrought Bow. He yanked back the bowstring and let an arrow fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Sacred Power arrow rocketed out of the Bloodwrought Bow, smashing through Bancroft's attack and hurtling straight at him without losing an ounce of speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft was sent reeling backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He staggered around, fighting to keep his feet under him, and a dribble of blood oozed from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gaped at Osborne, his face a picture of shock as he took in the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A quasi-Sacred Artifact!" Greed flashed in Bancroft's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a chuckle. "You're still eyeing my quasi-Sacred Artifact at a time like this? You're just signing your own death warrant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he drew the bow again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, three Sacred Power arrows materialized and locked onto Bancroft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft's face hardened in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered and said, "So what if it's a quasi-Sacred Artifact?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can take me out with that? You'll never get off Necoton Planet. You're trapped here for good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft made a quick, sweeping motion with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The huge warship lurking in the distance suddenly charged forward, projecting a thick defensive shield that wrapped around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle was just heating up, and the stakes couldn't have been higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two Sacred Power arrows shot out and slammed into the warship's sturdy defenses with a deafening bang. The massive shield shook violently but managed to hold its ground, deflecting the arrows without getting completely breached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes popped wide open in surprise, and he cocked an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad! This warship is probably on the cusp of becoming a quasi-Sacred Artifact! Its defenses are even tougher than Lord Malevolence's Malevolence Tower!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft smirked as he watched his defenses hold firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're done for! I told you, even if you've got a quasi-Sacred Artifact, it won't help you a bit! I've already sent word to other warriors from the Phantom Tide Demon Sect. They'll be here any minute, and you'll be swamped. This is where you'll breathe your last!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with a murderous glint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't fazed in the slightest. "You're getting way ahead of yourself! If my quasi-Sacred Artifact can't break through your ship's defenses, what about a real Sacred Artifact? Do you really think your warship can stand up to that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick flick of his hand, Osborne summoned the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, which materialized behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed straight at Bancroft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascending Sacred Sanctum, smash it to pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the huge Sanctum sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been hovering quietly, but in an instant, it shot forward at a terrifying speed, charging straight towards the massive warship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed was mind-boggling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum slammed into Bancroft's warship with such force that it shattered the warship into pieces, as easily as crushing a heap of rotten junk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion thundered through the air. Amid the chaos, Bancroft, who had been sheltered by the huge ship, was sent flying backward. Blood gushed from his mouth as he crashed into the rocky ground, creating a deep crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, he struggled to make sense of what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he managed to take a good look at the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, and his eyes nearly popped out of his head in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Sacred Artifact! A Sacred Artifact palace! How on earth is this possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft was overwhelmed with disbelief. But before he could pull himself together, he saw Osborne standing right in front of him, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's hand, wrapped in thick Sacred Power, lashed out with a savage punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It landed on Bancroft's chest with pinpoint accuracy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A huge, gaping wound ripped through him, shredding his insides. Miraculously, despite the utter carnage, he was still breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you..." Bancroft gasped, his face as white as a sheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stared into Osborne's eyes, terror was written all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd lost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defeated by Osborne, who was only at Ascension Seven! It was a bitter, hard-to-swallow reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold, mocking laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're one tough son of a gun! Too bad it won't save you; you're a goner! Die!" he roared, raising his fist again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft yelled, his voice laced with panic, "No! Spare me! I'll talk! I'm ready to spill the beans on who's backing me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stopped his punch just inches above Bancroft's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft's plea had come just in time; had he waited even a moment longer, Osborne's fist would have splattered his brains, and he'd have no chance of escaping that fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked menacingly. "If you had come to your senses sooner, you could've avoided this beating! But no, you had to be stubborn! You needed a lesson before you'd cooperate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Bancroft's pale face, Osborne channeled his Sacred Power, flooding into Bancroft's body and sealing his abilities, leaving him powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, tell me! Who's your backer?" he demanded coldly.</span></p></div>
