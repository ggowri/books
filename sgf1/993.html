        <h1>Chapter 993 Terrifying Power</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not even a Class S warrior can shatter my martial art aura with a Level Three Realm self-destruct! That's incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a surge of invigoration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His martial art aura had not only bolstered his defenses but had also greatly enhanced his recovery abilities. Just moments ago, the scythe of the Goddess of Grain had sliced through it, but now it was fully restored as it had never been touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In essence, Osborne's defensive capabilities had seen a massive boost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was more to it&mdash;his martial art aura was no longer just a shield; it was also a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Osborne relied solely on his martial art aura for defense because it had lacked the strength necessary for offense. Sure, it could amplify his attack power, but the effect was minimal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was better off using his aura entirely for defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as Osborne tapped into the depths of his martial art aura, he felt an almost palpable edge of sharpness reminiscent of the scythe of the Goddess of Grain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never encountered a divine artifact as razor-sharp as that one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sliced through even the sturdiest artifacts with ease, and now, he sensed that his </span><span>own martial art aura mirrored that lethal sharpness, capable of cleaving through anything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder just how powerful this is!" Osborne thought, bubbling with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced out the window and spotted a small mountain not far off. Without hesitation, he urged the driver to pull over, then bolted toward the rocky formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This mountain was composed entirely of solid stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he channeled his martial art aura to its fullest, wrapping himself in a cloak of dark red energy. When his aura met the rugged rock, thousands of tiny pinpricks erupted across the surface before it shattered under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this an offensive attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt like a porcupine, his aura bristling with danger. Anyone foolish enough to enter its perimeter would find themselves riddled with countless needle-like wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I really need to test if my martial art aura has truly gained this sharpness!" Osborne thought, rummaging through his Dimensional Space to retrieve a divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out an Ordinary divine dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Setting it atop the mountain, he clenched his fist, enveloping it in his martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful swing, Osborne unleashed a punch, aiming directly for the dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His </span><span>fist</span><span> collided with the dagger, and with a resounding crack, the artifact shattered under the force of his blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?" Osborne's breath caught in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had smashed the divine dagger with a single punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a matter of brute strength; it was the sharpness of his martial art aura that had utterly compromised the dagger's structure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had relied solely on force, even using the divine power of his right leg, there would be no way he could have simply kicked apart a divine artifact like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here Osborne was, achieving it with his martial art aura!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, it was an Ordinary divine artifact, but the feat was still astounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had once needed the Goddess of Grain's scythe to slice through such divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he had accomplished it with his martial art aura as well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it hadn't been as effortless as with the scythe, the sheer exhilaration of the moment filled Osborne with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder if a mid-grade divine artifact can be shattered under this pressure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, then pulled out a divine artifact from his Dimensional Space: the third axe of Hermes, the River God.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe of Strength leaned casually against a small hill, imposing and massive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, instead of using his fists, Osborne channeled his martial art aura through his left leg and delivered a powerful kick to the Axe of Strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook violently as a deafening explosion erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe of Strength was sent crashing into the hillside, creating a massive crater that burrowed deep into the earth. The entire hill trembled as if it were about to collapse, </span><span>showering Osborne with countless falling stones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These massive rocks slammed against his martial art aura, instantly disintegrating into tiny fragments that scattered harmlessly to the side. Osborne stood firm, unfazed by the chaos around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were locked on the enormous crater as he used mind control to retrieve the Axe of Strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it floated toward him, he examined the weapon closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's shock and delight, he noticed a small, jagged hole punctured into the axe's massive blade&mdash;a clear testament to the power of his kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "My martial art aura can even damage a mid-grade divine artifact! It may not be quite as sharp as the Goddess of Grain's scythe, but it's getting close!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, the Goddess of Grain's scythe might not even be necessary. My martial art aura will serve as my own scythe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Class S enemies will be easier than ever now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the exhilaration surged through him, his expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! There's a spatial fluctuation! The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's assassins are coming!"</span></p></div>
