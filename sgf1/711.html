        <h1>Chapter 711 Brutal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only seven of the fourteen Class AAA Evolved Humans were left, terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's relentless attack shattered their confidence&mdash;they knew they couldn&rsquo;t beat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fear, they fled, not daring to face him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">"Thought you clones were fearless. Guess not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he sat, using Satan&rsquo;s Eye to absorb star power, restoring his strength and soul. The battle had thrilled him but drained him mentally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his aura grew stronger, the remaining seven exchanged worried looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's regaining his strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's reached his limit! Don't be afraid; let's strike together and take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't let him recover!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fueled by fear but now finding their courage, the seven exchanged determined looks and charged at Osborne. Leading the charge were two Duke Taurens and two Duke Werewolves, hoping to catch Osborne off guard while he was still vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's face paled as she saw their approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, a glint of mischief in his eyes, "Relax! I'm luring them in. You think I can't handle them just because my mental strength is low?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he surged forward, unleashing a barrage of punches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deadly Force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ninefold Tide Crash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Point Blank Force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't relying on power anymore; he was using pure physical strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was already incredibly powerful, and after transforming into a Vampire, his strength had more than doubled. With the martial art aura amplifying his every move, each punch and kick carried terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Duke Taurens were the first to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Deadly Force was their kryptonite; all their strength was concentrated in their tough hides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne bypassed their defenses, shattering their insides with brutal precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Duke Taurens collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up were the two Duke Werewolves, who had transformed into massive beasts, unleashing their ultimate move&mdash;Death Claw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne stood his ground, undeterred. He took the hits, forcing his fists into their abdomens and crushing their hearts in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Duke Werewolves fell lifelessly beside their comrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body bore several gruesome wounds, blood streaming down and causing him to sway unsteadily. He leaned on his Goddess of Grain scythe to keep from collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma watched in shock and concern. "Osborne, let me down! I can still fight! You're hurt; you can't keep going like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled softly. "Who says I can't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he locked his gaze on the last three Class AAA Evolved Humans: one Duke Titan and two Duke Medusas. One of the Duke Medusas had already exhausted her energy from using her ultimate move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's </span><span>end </span><span>this!" Osborne roared in fury, his killing intent boiling over as he charged forward once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Formidable Punch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashes of Death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Duke Titan and Duke Medusa unleashed their final trump cards, hoping to take down Osborne once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne's body was petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Duke Titan's fist, like a cannonball, smashed into Osborne's stone form, sending him hurtling through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact nearly shattered the petrified body, leaving cracks in the stone skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce burst of martial art aura, Osborne forcibly dispelled the petrification, ignoring the strain. He sneered at the exhausted Duke Medusa and the armless Duke Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne charged again, the Goddess of Grain's scythe whirling in a frenzied arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Titan and Duke Medusa's desperate cries rang out, but they were powerless to stop their fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their heads soared into the air, severed and lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of the Aberrants' Class AAA Evolved Humans had been cut down by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spat a mouthful of blood, his body completely spent, unable to sustain his Vampire transformation. He slowly collapsed backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma, who had been lying on his back, was crushed beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Already gravely injured, Emma let out a muffled groan and fell unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was brutal.</span></p></div>
