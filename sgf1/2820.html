        <h1>Chapter 2668 Emperor Fruit-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before entering the Eighth Skyfall Casket, Frederick had mentioned a miraculous continent sealed within the Ninth Skyfall Casket. On that continent grew countless extraordinary plants, and consuming the flowers and fruits they bore could rapidly enhance cultivation level!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet also skyrocketed in power because of this!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the situation in the Eighth Skyfall Casket is clearly different from the Ninth Skyfall Casket. What&rsquo;s sealed here is an Ancient Battlefield. Osborne had not seen any living creatures here before, not even a single blade of grass, but now he has discovered a jungle!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought to himself, "Could these be the same extraordinary plants as those in the Ninth Skyfall Casket?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became a bit excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Doesn't matter if it is or not, I'll know once I check it out! Anyway, the area is filled with astral projections above Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, which I can't handle right now. Might as well explore the jungle. At least there doesn't seem to be any astral projection battles there, so it should be safe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took action immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of thousands of miles were nothing for Osborne. After confirming there was no danger in the jungle, he used interdimensional travel to get there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, the jungle was vast enough, so even if there were some errors while traveling, he wouldn't end up in a dangerous area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne arrived at the edge of the jungle in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he got there, Osborne felt a strong surge of life energy rushing toward him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This jungle is real after all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is not power projection!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very happy, and what excited him even more was that the crystal-clear fruits on the trees were indeed emperor herb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That really is emperor herb!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had exchanged some emperor herbs at Celestial Spire, including fifty that could extend lifespan, fifty that could enhance potential and talent, and thirty-three that could heal injuries...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each one was incredibly expensive, costing 10 billion battle points!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That&rsquo;s 10 billion battle points, while the exchange price for an Inferior Imperial Artifact is only 5 billion battle points!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So the rarity of emperor herb goes without saying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One emperor herb or one emperor fruit is worth the equivalent of two Inferior Imperial Artifacts!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And in this jungle...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just from what Osborne can see now, there are at least hundreds of crystal-clear emperor fruits. And how many more emperor fruits lie deeper in the jungle, Osborne doesn&rsquo;t know.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Satan's Eye cannot see through the depths of the jungle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "So many!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What exactly are the effects of these emperor fruits?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t sense any danger around, so he reached out and picked an emperor fruit. Smelling its fragrant aroma, he swallowed hard but didn&rsquo;t dare to eat it directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn&rsquo;t sure if this emperor fruit was poisonous!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne decided to find someone to try it and figure out the effects of this emperor fruit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And his best test subject was, of course, Hendrix!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne released Hendrix from the Dimensional Microcosm. Hendrix was very weak at this moment. He had still been tormented by Osborne's Spatial Clone these past few days. His eyes were blank, showing no reaction to the outside world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne let out a cold snort, feeling no pity at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He cut a small piece of the emperor fruit, shoved it into Hendrix's mouth, forced him to swallow, and carefully observed the changes in his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Seems like it's not poisonous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hendrix's strength seems to have increased? And the improvement is quite significant. Just one emperor fruit actually boosted his cultivation level this much?"</span></p></div>
