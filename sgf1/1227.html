        <h1>Chapter 1226 The Deschanel Clan's Prodigy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he couldn't afford to wait any longer. He plunged into the depths of the ocean, quickly tossing the pristine white Sanctuary Casket onto the seabed. Without a moment's hesitation, he slipped into a parallel dimension, hiding himself from whatever might come next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea what secrets lay within that Casket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be a powerful ancient being?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this Sanctuary Casket was unlike any he had encountered before. It was unlikely that an ordinary Deschanel family deity could even use it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever, or whatever, was inside had to be extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone powerful emerged, someone he couldn't contend with, it would spell disaster for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne decided to lay low and observe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments after he secured the Casket on the ocean floor, its lid began to creak open. A surge of divine power erupted from within, causing the surrounding water to part and form a shimmering halo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he peered down, Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He caught sight of the figure inside the Casket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of a menacing ancient entity, it was a girl&mdash;no older than fifteen or sixteen&mdash;looking delicate and ethereal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a stunning gown that shimmered in the dim light, and her flawless face bore no trace of imperfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her long, snow-white hair was strikingly unusual, adding to her otherworldly aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, her eyes snapped open, glowing with a vibrant purple light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she slowly rose from the Casket, her gaze was a mix of confusion and innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where am I?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy? Mommy? Where are you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was melodic, reminiscent of birdsong, laced with a childlike innocence that tugged at Osborne's heartstrings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Thank goodness it's not an ancient monster. This girl looks young and innocent&mdash;definitely not a disguise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She must have been a child before she fell asleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he looked closer, and his heart sank. Glancing at the five blue Divine Flames flickering above her head, he gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celestial Deity! A sixth-level Divine Body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but gasp out loud. Fortunately, he was in the parallel space, so his surprised exclamation didn't carry out, but the shock on his face was palpable, impossible to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implications were staggering. This girl wasn't just any being. She was a Celestial Deity, a warrior of immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above the Celestial Deity was the Deity Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a fleeting moment, Osborne considered bolting. But then he noticed that four of the five Divine Flames were dim, with only two glowing brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant her strength was diminished; she had only regained the power of an Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Intermediate Deity? I can handle that," Osborne reassured himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to stay and uncover the truth about this extraordinary girl. It was hard to believe that someone so young could be a Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could she be a prodigy from the Deschanel Clan? If that's the case, I might have to take drastic measures."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint flashed in his eyes as he contemplated his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the girl suddenly looked up, her brow furrowing in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strange... Why do I feel like someone's watching me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have I been discovered?" he thought, panic surging through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the little girl glanced at his position for a moment before shifting her gaze elsewhere; her eyes still filled with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a silent sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This girl was anything but ordinary. After all, before her slumber, she was a Celestial Deity-class warrior. Though her current strength had diminished to that of an Intermediate Deity, it was reasonable that she could faintly sense Osborne's probing presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she clearly had no ability to pinpoint his exact location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl called out in a sweet yet commanding tone, "Who's there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's spying on me? Show yourself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see you! Why are you watching me? If you don't step out soon, I'm not going to be gentle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her entire body radiated caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but eventually emerged from the parallel space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl scrutinized Osborne, and her gaze sharp with suspicion. Then, her expression shifted to one of surprise. "Wait a second! How strange! You have... a Waste Divine Body? A Junior Deity? How is that possible? With your level of strength, how did I not detect you sooner?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And yet, I sense a formidable threat from you! Your power is significant enough to pose a real danger to me right now! Odd!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chose not to respond immediately. His voice came out raspy as he asked, "Who are you? State your identity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready for anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this little girl truly was the Deschanel Clan's prodigy, he wouldn't hesitate to strike first. He had to neutralize her threat, even if it meant killing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way Osborne could allow her to become a future enemy of the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who am I?"</span></p></div>
