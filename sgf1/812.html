        <h1>Chapter 812 Another Battle With Cuthbert</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne swiftly absorbed the remaining blood energy from the battlefield, feeling the Blood Cross grow even more agile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But there was no time for him to savor the improvement. He fled the scene, plunging deeper into the forest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His cover had been blown.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tethynia, a stronghold of the Aberrants, was home to the Williamson family, one of the top Divine Families.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were bound to inform the Aberrants of his presence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Osborne didn't escape to Rosmandi quickly, he'd find himself pursued not only by the Williamson family but also by the Aberrants.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's eyes widened in shock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? His real identity is Osborne from the Augustine family in Rosmandi?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"According to our intel, this Osborne is supposed to be the Augustine family's top heir. He had the audacity to come to Tethynia and provoke us?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's asking for trouble!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get in touch with the Aberrants immediately and let them know their target is in Tethynia. We need them to send reinforcements to help us hunt him down!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you've been masquerading as a member of the Lambert family and disrupted our Williamson family's plans during the Honor Quest Ceremony. You're as good as dead!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I might not be able to deal with you personally, but finding your location and informing others is definitely within my reach."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Marvin shut his eyes tightly, seemingly concentrating.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alert Cuthbert. Osborne is still in the back mountains of the Williamson family, near the Lunar Summit. If possible, he should be captured alive. If we can nab the Augustine family's top heir, it would be quite the prize."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Osborne had taken refuge in a narrow canyon. Nearby, two crescent-shaped peaks loomed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He found a cave and huddled inside, thinking, "I've already covered several miles. It shouldn't be too easy for the Williamson family to track me down now. I need to figure out how to get back to Rosmandi.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The area's spatial freeze makes Dimensional Space travel impossible.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, maintaining such a wide spatial freeze must be taxing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If I can stay hidden long enough, the Williamson family will eventually lift the freeze, and then I can use interdimensional travel to get back to Rosmandi in one go."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this plan in mind, Osborne began to recuperate.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the apparent ease of his battle with Mose and the others, only Osborne knew the true struggle he faced. His Light Realm and Thunder Realm had been shattered, causing a significant backlash to his mental strength.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although his extraordinary recovery rate had nearly mended the damage, his power reserves were still not fully restored.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, footsteps echoed nearby.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression grew serious as he activated Satan's Eye.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Through its vision, he saw a tall figure approaching steadily.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Cuthbert.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, I know you're in there. Come out and face me! Let's have a fair fight!" Cuthbert's voice was icy and resolute.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face fell.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "I've covered miles and erased all traces. How could they find me so quickly? Can the Williamson family really track my location? This is a problem."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clenching his teeth, Osborne slowly stepped out of the cave to face Cuthbert.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment Cuthbert laid eyes on Osborne, his gaze burned with a wild, murderous fury, and his body trembled with rage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you sabotaged the Honor Quest Ceremony and humiliated me in the arena. I promised I'd use your blood to cleanse my dishonor. Well, here I am!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert slowly drew out a massive staff, its surface adorned with intricate carvings of fierce beasts. The staff seemed incredibly heavy in his hands, hinting at its formidable nature.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a divine artifact, an item of immense power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said, "Osborne, you defeated me in the arena only because I was drained and couldn't use my divine artifact.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Plus, I underestimated you. But now, we're on equal footing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll crush you into pulp with no effort at all! Are you ready to meet your end?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His aura was fierce and unrelenting, fully charged with the strength of his divine artifact.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, facing the full brunt of Cuthbert's power, looked grim.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really think you can wash away your disgrace by killing me? Unfortunately, you're mistaken!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's face twisted into a cruel grin. "Mistaken? Ha! Let me show you what I'm truly capable of!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he swung the massive staff with all his might.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, a terrifying force erupted as the staff smashed down onto Osborne's martial art aura.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The impact shattered Osborne's aura like glass.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The overwhelming force surged into Osborne's body, sending him sprawling through the air, blood spattering from his mouth.</p></div>
