        <h1>Chapter 2614 Re-enter the Palace</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two days passed quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne and the other two, due to the hundredfold Time Acceleration, they had actually been training for over half a year.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this half-year, Osborne's own strength saw almost no improvement. However, he successfully left his mark on the Domain Suppression Stele, Sacred Turtle Mountain, and Dragon Binding Rope, the three Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just three months, Osborne was able to skillfully control these three Supreme Sacred Artifacts with a high level of affinity, without any concerns about handling them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All of this was thanks to the help of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without the Warfare Ancient Tree, Osborne could at most only perform basic control over these three Supreme Sacred Artifacts. If anything unexpected happened, he might even suffer a backlash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, this issue no longer troubles him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the days that followed, Osborne focused on studying the two relics Michelle left behind: a ring and a token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne named them Violet Flower Ring and Violet Flower Token because both items had a violet flower at their center, seemingly as a symbol, surrounded by creatures like Sacred Dragons and phoenixes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne first studied the Violet Flower Token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, this was a Supreme Sacred Artifact valued at 18 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, nearly three times the price of an ordinary Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Michelle's name was engraved on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, the Violet Flower Token could not be stored in Dimensional Space and was even unaffected by the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree, as a Primordial Creature, according to Primordial's explanation, could influence and suppress all Sacred Artifacts upon reaching Empyrean Sacredness. When it reached Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, it could exert the same influence and suppression on all Imperial Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even with such immense power, it could do nothing to the Violet Flower Token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if the Warfare Ancient Tree took action, it couldn't take the Violet Flower Token from Osborne's hand, let alone hang it on its trunk.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne conducted a detailed study of the Violet Flower Token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, he didn't discover anything valuable. On the surface, the Violet Flower Token seemed to be just an ordinary Supreme Sacred Artifact with strong defensive capabilities. Once activated, it would generate a purple energy flower, enveloping Osborne for protection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its defensive power was not much different from other defensive-type Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After extensive research, Osborne still didn't uncover any additional information.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He eventually gave up on further exploring the Violet Flower Token and simply hung it at his waist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, he began studying another relic left by Michelle, the Legendary Sacred Artifact ring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the research, Osborne noticed something unusual. This ring was not just a defensive ring but also emitted faint spatial fluctuations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This means it&rsquo;s a space ring!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside, there might be a Dimensional Space or even a Dimensional Microcosm, usable for storage and possibly holding other items of Michelle's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne realized this, he felt incredibly excited and thrilled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his spatial power, he could fully unlock the Dimensional Microcosm on the ring and retrieve Michelle's other belongings inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne's excitement quickly faded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he discovered he couldn't unlock the Dimensional Microcosm on the ring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he could sense the spatial fluctuation on the Violet Flower Ring, he couldn't grasp it, let alone activate it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This left Osborne utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His current spatial power essence had already reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness, immensely powerful, yet he still couldn't unlock a Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne tried many methods, but all ended in failure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It seems the Dimensional Microcosm on the Violet Flower Ring has been forcibly sealed by some power. Unless my spatial power essence becomes stronger, opening the Dimensional Microcosm on the Violet Flower Ring and obtaining what's inside is absolutely impossible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne ultimately had no choice but to put away the Violet Flower Ring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This ring, though a Legendary Sacred Artifact, held no significance for Osborne's defense now. Forcing it to be used for defense might even cause it to shatter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a keepsake left to him by Michelle, and he would never want it to suffer any damage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the Violet Flower Token, since it couldn't be put away, Osborne decided not to use it either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After studying Michelle's keepsakes, he walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy had also finished their training. Over the past half year, they successfully absorbed the remaining Legendary Dragon Elixir, making their auras incredibly refined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for Osborne using Satan's Eye, he might have mistaken them for ordinary people. This indicated that their control over power had reached an extremely high level, and their strength had significantly increased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, either of them could easily defeat Seraphina from the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, with the help of the Legendary Dragon Elixir, they could now skillfully wield the Supreme Sacred Artifact obtained from the Royal Treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In summary, their strength had advanced by leaps and bounds once again, ready to break through to Empyrean Sacredness at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! The Palace guards are here again, we should enter the Palace now!" Osborne shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two nodded and asked softly, "Osborne, where exactly is the Royal Family taking us? They only mentioned it's a place of opportunity where treasures and resources can be obtained, but nothing else."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment and said, "The place we're heading to is called Necropolis City, and it's extremely dangerous. You must be careful, stay close to me, and avoid taking any reckless actions."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said no more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two exchanged a glance and nodded in agreement, "Alright, we'll follow your lead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the three joined the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Led by the Palace guards, all the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel contestants returned to the Palace and arrived at an extremely spacious square.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, there were others waiting in the square.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were a group of princes and princesses from the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them were Seraphina, fully recovered from her injuries, as well as Emiliano, Matthew, and other princes and princesses who had participated in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, there were a few princes and princesses with terrifying auras.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne saw them and immediately narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crown Prince Weston!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prince Quinn!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Princess Naomi!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prince Hendrix!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all present, dressed in dashing combat uniforms, clearly ready to enter Necropolis City with Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like all the princes and princesses who have reached Empyrean Sacredness cultivation level are here," Osborne observed the group.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were more than ten of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the strength of the Royal Family. Even the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, considered a supreme warrior in other forces, numbers as many as ten in the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only that, Naomi and Quinn's cultivation level has surpassed Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, stepping into Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Weston has even reached Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne observed them, they also looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, their gazes turned grim and icy, brimming with killing intent.</span></p></div>
