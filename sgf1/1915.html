        <h1>Chapter 1914 The Clash of Soul Powers</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph quickly realized that his Soul Spark Oblivion was ineffective against Osborne's golden soul power. If he relied solely on burning it away, it would take ages to completely extinguish Osborne's energy. So, he decided it was time to take matters into his own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Engaging in a battle of soul power was incredibly perilous, but Adolph was brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne's soul power was substantial, it was merely equivalent to what Adolph had when he first broke through to Supernal Deity King. Now, his own soul power far surpassed Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after traveling billions of miles, which had weakened his soul power, Adolph felt assured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was a warrior who specialized in soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His control over it was leagues ahead of anyone else's. While others with the same amount of soul power might only unleash a fraction of its potential, Adolph could harness its full might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, even in Osborne's own Soul Current Ocean, he felt certain of victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could completely annihilate Osborne's soul power, Adolph would seize control of Osborne's Soul Current Ocean and turn his body into an avatar!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to end this!" Adolph roared, launching his soul power at Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the incoming assault, and his expression darkened, anger boiling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you looking for death? You dare to invade my Soul Current Ocean and try to take out my soul power? Who do you think you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne began to retaliate, commanding his own soul power to push back against Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His soul power was formidable, especially in his own territory, and he had no intention of losing to Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it didn't take long for Osborne to be shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His soul power was no match for Adolph's!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was a metahuman of soul power, with control that dwarfed Osborne's. Though Osborne possessed a natural talent that made his soul power impressive, he lacked the refined mastery that only came with dedicated training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Adolph was an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When their soul powers clashed, Osborne's was scattered, leaving him dizzy and disoriented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Adolph's energy remained unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph couldn't help but laugh triumphantly. "Ha! Give it up! I'm an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King of soul power! Sure, your soul power is massive and unique&mdash;golden and incredibly resilient&mdash;but your control is infantile!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how tough your golden soul power is, I'll shatter it piece by piece until it's utterly obliterated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Soul Current Ocean will be mine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And your body? That belongs to me, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mocking words echoed through the realm, crystal clear to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury ignited within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can take my Soul Current Ocean? My body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King focusing on soul power, so what? You'll have to defeat me first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne gathered his scattered soul power and charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph sneered, unfazed by Osborne's audacity, "You're asking for it! Let's send you packing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silent yet deadly clash of soul powers raged on. Despite his confidence, Adolph didn't let his guard down. He poured all his energy into controlling his soul power, repeatedly smashing through Osborne's golden defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's golden soul power shattered again and again, only to reform and surge toward Adolph once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Adolph began to sense something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's golden soul power was proving to be astonishingly resilient. If it were any other warrior, after being shattered so many times, their soul power would have evaporated completely, leaving them a mere shell of their former selves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, his soul power splintered dozens of times, only to spring back stronger after each onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a second!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph realized that the speed of Osborne's recovery was accelerating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he sensed that Osborne's control of his soul power was improving through this exchange. Trying to scatter Osborne's soul power was becoming increasingly challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was dumbfounded after witnessing another round of his attacks fail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had exerted around eighty percent of his strength this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, Osborne's golden soul power nearly instantaneously pulled itself together, surging back at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you recover this quickly? Even if you downed a white Miracle Elixir, it shouldn't replenish your soul power at this rate! What in the world is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic crept into Adolph's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne wore a sly smile, thinking to himself, "With the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity backing me up, restoring my soul power is a walk in the park. Adolph thinks he can wipe out my soul power and take my domain? He's playing with fire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll outlast him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, with every clash of our powers, my control is sharpening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared, "You're done for!" As he felt the surge of energy within him, Osborne's confidence grew; he was determined to turn the tide against Adolph.</span></p></div>
