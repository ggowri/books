        <h1>Chapter 2353 Huge Gains</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasn't planning to waste time. After all, there were hundreds of Warfare Ancient Trees here. If he wanted to take all the Fruit Battleships, he would have to pass over a hundred trials.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he had to speed up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow, casually channeling some Sacred Power without merging the Divine Ascendance Technique, simply condensing ten Sacred Power Arrows on the Bloodwrought Bow, each aimed at the ten distant Fruit Battleships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's view, these Fruit Battleships were merely comparable to top-tier divine artifacts. With his current strength, the Sacred Power Arrows he condensed could easily destroy them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The trial begins." The next second, the voice of the Warfare Ancient Tree echoed in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the ten distant Fruit Battleships began to move, as if controlled by someone. Their defensive shields enveloped the ships, quickly radiating light as they charged toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate and immediately released the bowstring. Instantly, ten Sacred Power Arrows shot out at incredible speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, to Osborne's surprise, the ten Fruit Battleships were incredibly fast as well. They seemed to know they couldn't withstand Osborne's Sacred Power Arrows, so they quickly lined up in a straight formation, using the frontmost Fruit Battleship to block Osborne's Sacred Power Arrows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, all ten Sacred Power Arrows hit the frontmost Fruit Battleship, instantly blasting it apart. However, the power of the Sacred Power Arrows was also depleted. After destroying the next two Fruit Battleships, the Sacred Power Arrows completely dissipated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the seven remaining Fruit Battleships had gathered their strength and charged toward Osborne again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Osborne was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt he had underestimated these Fruit Battleships. Their defense was much stronger than he had anticipated, even making Osborne think they were comparable to some quasi-Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the Fruit Battleships' attack reached him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could have easily dodged. However, to test the power of the Fruit Battleships' attacks, he chose to take them head-on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, endless explosions erupted around Osborne. A look of surprise appeared on his face once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the attacks from the seven Fruit Battleships didn&rsquo;t hurt him, their power shattered much of the Eclipse War Armor he had formed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such attack power was almost equivalent to a full-force strike from a typical Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If ten Fruit Battleships attacked simultaneously, a warrior at Ascension Ten might not be able to withstand it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's face was filled with joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Fruit Battleships were only at the level of supreme divine artifacts. However, Osborne believed their attack and defense power rivaled quasi-Sacred Artifacts, far stronger than ordinary supreme divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're all great treasures." Osborne was very pleased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The stronger these Fruit Battleships were, the happier Osborne became, as he had already decided to take them all back to Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Technically, I am still the ruler of Celestara Planet, the king of the Empire of the Sun. My grandfather and the others are still on Celestara Planet. With these Fruit Battleships, the strength of the Empire of the Sun will skyrocket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Things like Lord Malevolence occupying Celestara Planet will never happen again. Unless warriors at the level of Empyrean Sacredness want to take over Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for warriors at the level of Empyrean Sacredness, Celestara Planet is too small and lacks resources. Celestara Planet doesn't even have a single ordinary Sacred Crystal vein, so why would they want Celestara Planet?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, with these Fruit Battleships, I won't have to worry about Celestara Planet's defense. Let me deal with them first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After testing the power of the Fruit Battleship, Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow again. This time, under his control, the Fruit Battleships couldn't withstand his attacks and were blown apart one by one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne left this special trial space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Challenger, you have won. Now, all my fruits belong to you," Warfare Ancient Tree conceded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the ten massive Fruit Battleships on the Warfare Ancient Tree detached from it, then slowly flew in front of Osborne and quickly shrank to palm size.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne became even more delighted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He put away the ten Fruit Battleships and said to the Warfare Ancient Tree, "Warfare Ancient Tree, thank you for your gift."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree swayed slightly, seemingly in response. Osborne didn't think much of it and walked toward the second Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial and Agatha caught up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha asked, "Osborne, what's the situation now? Did you pass the test? How difficult was it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and then explained the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha was very surprised and then said, "Let me help you. There are hundreds of Warfare Ancient Trees here, and it would take you a long time to pass their tests alone and obtain all the Fruit Battleships."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll take the tests with you. These Fruit Battleships are of no use to me. They'll all be yours in the end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne felt a bit happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Agatha's strength, she could easily pass the tests of the Warfare Ancient Trees. After all, in fact, Agatha was stronger than him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Agatha's help, things would be much easier for him. So, Osborne said, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha smiled and said, "I should be the one thanking you. If it weren't for you, I would have been dead long ago. If that were the case, how could I have such an opportunity? I don't know how to repay you. Helping you with something makes me feel a bit better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Agatha walked toward a Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Agatha closed her eyes. Shortly after, she opened them again. Over a dozen Fruit Battleships on the Warfare Ancient Tree flew down, then shrank. Subsequently, Agatha put them away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne withdrew his gaze and then looked at Primordial. "Primordial, you go help too. With your current strength, you can easily pass the test of the Warfare Ancient Tree. Stop thinking about slacking off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial rolled his eyes and said reluctantly, "I'm just a little sapling right now, not fully grown yet. You're exploiting child labor."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glared at him and threatened, "You can choose not to help. But if we come across other World Tree offshoots in the future, I won't help either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial immediately fell silent, quietly flying to a Warfare Ancient Tree nearby to start the test.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this scene, Osborne stopped wasting time and entered the test again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With previous experience, Osborne quickly dealt with all the Fruit Battleship projections this time, passed the test, and obtained over a dozen Fruit Battleships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he continued with the test.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two and the tree completed the tests very quickly. The hundreds of Warfare Ancient Trees before them couldn't resist at all and had to obediently hand over their Fruit Battleships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>About two hours later, all 5,200 Fruit Battleships from the 360 Warfare Ancient Trees were obtained by them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is quite a haul," Osborne said with a smile. He gathered all the Fruit Battleships together and stored them in the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With these 5,200 Fruit Battleships, he could even form a fleet to explore major resource planets and search for resources.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't be too quick to celebrate. There's something even more exciting ahead," Primordial said. "I can sense the presence of more Warfare Ancient Trees over there. Moreover, those Warfare Ancient Trees are even stronger."</span></p></div>
