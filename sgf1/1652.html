        <h1>Chapter 1651 Algernon's Regret</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Led by Algernon, the exploration team pressed forward, completely oblivious to the fact that hundreds of Deathborns were silently closing in behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thick, swirling fog obscured the forms of the Deathborn, shrouding them in shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without haste, the Deathborn scattered, surrounding the twenty-eight members of the exploration team completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in unison, they struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook with the force of their attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, Algernon and his team were stunned as the wave of assaults descended from all directions in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Algernon shouted, "Enemy attack! Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late. The relentless barrage overwhelmed the team, and most hadn't even finished summoning their divine power for defense. Their Malevolence Amulets could block one killing blow, but they were facing a storm of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening blast, those Malevolence Amulets shattered, their bodies following suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air filled with horrified screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Algernon, who considered himself quite experienced and confident in his ability to lead everyone back alive, found himself injured in the chaos, sent flying and coughing up blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, among the hundreds of Deathborns, none were particularly powerful&mdash;at least, there were no mid-tier Deity Overlords, just about a dozen initial-tier ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Algernon's fate would have surely been sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ferocity of the Deathborn's surprise assault had devastating results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of the twenty-eight </span><span>exploration</span><span> members, only Algernon and three others in the initial tier of Deity Overlord were left standing, all gravely injured, while the rest lay dead&mdash;one of them, a fellow Deity Overlord, ambushed and killed in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scenario left Algernon in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his third time at Divine Peak Nine, and in his previous visits, he had been lucky, avoiding any significant Deathborn onslaught and emerging unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the relentless attacks continued to pour down like rain, he sensed the chilling touch of death closing in around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Algernon refused to accept his demise without a fight, igniting a deep well of power within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surge of energy radiated from him as he unleashed his mid-tier Deity Overlord strength, pushing back the Deathborn with a ferocious display of combat prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joined by the three remaining allies, they fought together against the overwhelming horde, each one pouring everything they had into the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the four of them fought back, the Deathborn momentarily faltered, but they remained coolly calculated, encircling the group and slowly wearing them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Marley, what do we do now?" one of the initial-tier Deity Overlords yelled, panic evident in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already been injured in the ambush, and the intensity of the battle was taking its toll. He was nearing the brink of exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't fucking know!" Algernon barked, his face flushed and rage spilling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also on the verge of breaking down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Algernon's words crushed the man's spirit, and desperation seeped into his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened to your confidence, Algernon? You boasted about bringing us all back alive, but now you just stand there like a deer in headlights! Is this how you lead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all your fault! You're the one who led us here. The moment we set foot in Divine Peak Nine, we were ambushed! It was a trap from the get-go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You should have listened to that Human Community guy who warned us about Deathborn tailing us! You ignored his advice&mdash;why?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the reason we're all dying, Algernon! I curse you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy was screaming at Algernon, full of rage because he knew he was going to die. There were over a hundred Deathborns, acting like a well-coordinated army. They were working together so smoothly it was scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in their group was badly hurt. There was no way they could escape from these Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last three members, who were early-stage Deity Overlords, were also killed by the Deathborn's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only Algernon was left, struggling to stay alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was pure despair in his eyes. Even if he wasn't injured, facing over a hundred Deathborns, it would be almost impossible to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, injured as he was, he knew he couldn't hold on much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Algernon regretted not listening to Osborne's advice. He should have checked behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If I hadn't looked down on Osborne and had followed his suggestion, maybe... maybe things would be different now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late for regrets. Over a hundred Deathborns charged at him, tearing his body apart and consuming his flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, everything fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched from behind the thick cover of a tree as the last Deathborn disappeared into the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind was still processing what she had just witnessed&mdash;a brutal ambush that left twenty-eight members of the exploration team dead, with not a single survivor. She couldn't help but feel a chill run down her spine, her thoughts racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're all gone?" Diana murmured to herself. The reality of the situation hit her like a ton of bricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thirty people in the exploration team, and in less than an hour on Divine Peak Nine, twenty-eight of them are dead? We're the only one left?"</span></p></div>
