        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the same level, I am invincible. Everyone else is irrelevant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light stared at Osborne, stunned into silence by his bold declaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of person could say something so audacious&mdash;that at the same level, they are invincible, and everyone else doesn't matter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, she wouldn't dare say it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even the God of Night or Lord Malevolence would dare to say such a thing. And yet, Osborne had said it with absolute confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he just arrogant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he being reckless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this were before, God of Light might have thought so. After all, no matter how strong someone is, there's always someone stronger in certain areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone wants to be invincible, but who could truly achieve it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even being invincible at the same level was something no one had ever managed to achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne... he seemed to truly believe it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne hadn't personally fought in the earlier battles, the strength displayed by Anastasia, Zoe, and the others was already enough to leave her in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were only at Ascension One, yet they could easily defeat those at Ascension Three. In the past, this was something only the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings could achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now... when Osborne declared himself invincible at the same level, Anastasia, Zoe, and the others didn't object. Instead, they all looked as though they agreed wholeheartedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This showed that Anastasia, Zoe, and the others had absolute faith in Osborne's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So just how powerful was Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, God of Light looked at Osborne and saw someone who reminded her of the one who had once guided their training...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she were witnessing a younger version of the God of Night rising to power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps even more confident&mdash;and stronger&mdash;than the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exhaled sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light shook her head forcefully, trying to dismiss such a frightening thought. She couldn't help but feel a pang of regret&mdash;that Osborne had appeared far too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was only at Ascension One; he hadn't yet fully developed his potential. But the Paramount Supreme Clan was already preparing to launch a full-scale attack on the Human Community. If Osborne had just a few hundred more years to grow, to reach Ascension Seven or even Ascension Eight...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Osborne and the God of Night could join forces to take down Lord Malevolence and restore Celestara to its original order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there wasn't enough time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I believe what you're saying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light spoke gravely, "If we follow your plan exactly, we can definitely win the Ascension One through Four rounds of the competition! As for the Deity Overlord and Deity King matches, since you're confident, we'll assume we can win those too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she said this, God of Light frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now I'm wondering if I should let you fight. Your talent and potential are too extraordinary! If you take the stage during the competition, you'll undoubtedly expose yourselves... At that point, I'm afraid the Paramount Supreme Clan will stop at nothing to eliminate you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, do you think any of that still matters? The Paramount Supreme Clan is already preparing for an all-out war! If it weren't for the competition you proposed, the war would've already begun!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community is already on the brink of life and death! Even if we don't take the stage and reveal our talents, do we still have the time to train? Do we even have a future?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we keep losing the competition, the morale of the Human Alliance will sink to rock bottom. Even if no one surrenders or betrays us, do you think the Dark Deity Legion won't seize the chance to attack when the alliance's morale collapses?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And once they attack, how long can the Human Alliance hold out? Are we supposed to stand idly by, watching our soldiers bleed on the frontlines while we hide in the back, peacefully training?</span></p></div>
