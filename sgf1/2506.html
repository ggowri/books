        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "Why are you in such a hurry? The </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon isn't that easy to hatch. If it were easy, the Magma Devourer would have hatched it long ago, and it wouldn't be your turn."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Staring at the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg, Primordial seemed to be deep in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His branch-like hand was touching his chin at the moment, looking somewhat comical.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne did not disturb him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew that if it came to knowledge, he was no match for Primordial. If Primordial couldn't figure out a way to quickly hatch the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon, then there was no point in him trying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Staring at the transparent coffin, Osborne felt a bit puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surrounding mist was clearly released by the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg. This mist was likely meant to protect the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg. It was incredibly powerful, so much so that even a top-tier warrior at the level of Empyrean Sacredness couldn't break through it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as soon as the transparent coffin appeared, the mist automatically opened a gap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Could it be that this </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg doesn't belong to the Magma Devourer, but to the Wingless Angel in the transparent coffin?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that his guess was quite reliable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A scene seemed to appear in Osborne's mind. On a certain day long ago, the Magma Devourer found a transparent coffin and an </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg within the core of a star.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To claim the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg for itself, the Magma Devourer left the star it had always lived on and came to a small resource planet at the edge of the universe. It killed all the natives on the planet and took it over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using the planet's environment, the Magma Devourer wanted to hatch the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg. It even planted a large number of Beast Soul Flowers in advance, preparing food for the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon after hatching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, after tens of thousands of years, the Magma Devourer still failed to hatch the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg, and the warriors from the Racial Convergence Planet discovered this planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Wingless Angel in the transparent coffin was the true owner of the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt this guess was closer to the truth, but it didn&rsquo;t matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have an idea," Primordial suddenly said. "I thought of a way to quickly hatch the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg. However, it might be a bit risky. If we fail, this </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg might never hatch again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But this is the only way. Otherwise, this </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg won't hatch naturally even after tens of thousands of years, because the conditions here simply aren't suitable for hatching it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne curiously asked, "What&rsquo;s the method?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Blood-Sacrificing Magic," Primordial said seriously. "Blood-Sacrificing Magic is an ancient ritual method. Initially, it used blood sacrifices to exchange for power from the cosmos. But later, it evolved into many variations, giving Blood-Sacrificing Magic numerous forms."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I happen to know a variation of Blood-Sacrificing Magic. It should accelerate the growth of the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg and make it hatch quickly. However, it will require you to consume a large amount of blood."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg will also become a sacrifice for the Blood-Sacrificing Magic. If this method fails, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg will completely die and turn into a dead egg."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned, thinking, "Normally, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg might not naturally hatch for tens of thousands of years? Only Blood-Sacrificing Magic has a chance to hatch it quickly? But if the hatching fails, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg will become a dead egg."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hesitated because the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg was too precious. If he could hatch the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon, it would become a great ally for him. Therefore, Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to take any risks.</span></p></div>
