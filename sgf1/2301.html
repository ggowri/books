        <h1>Chapter 2253 Quasi Sacred Artifact Badge-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Angela wrapped up, she took off, and an Elder escorted Osborne to the awards stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this Sect Tournament, Osborne had emerged as the ultimate dark horse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd taken down last year's champ, Vadim, the runner-up, Jamar, and the third-place finisher, Bethan, to claim the undisputed championship title.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan, with her nifty footwork and skills on display, managed to outshine Jamar in their match and snagged the runner-up spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar, despite giving it his all, had to settle for third place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the top ten contestants stepped onto the stage one by one, they all practically buzzed with excitement. For a lot of them, just making it into the top ten was a dream come true. After all, it meant racking up Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> and getting a ticket to the upcoming city duel in Tempest Fortress City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it was Osborne's turn, Lenny stepped in to present the award himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinning from ear to ear, Lenny walked up to Osborne and handed him a shiny golden medal of honor. It was emblazoned with the Mystic Sirius Sect's emblem and a big, bold number&mdash;One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lenny declared, "This proves you're the mightiest disciple of Mystic Sirius Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, congrats!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've tapped into Sacred Power before your peers, and I can't wait to see you fly the flag for Mystic Sirius Sect in the city and state duels. I'm banking on big things from you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lenny draped the badge on Osborne, he felt a subtle energy thrumming from it, leaving him lost for words for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A quasi-Sacred Artifact?!" Osborne blurted </span><span>out,</span><span> his eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bingo!" Lenny shot back with a beaming smile. "This here's a quasi-Sacred Artifact, and it's a defensive one at that. It's called the Badge of Mystic Sirius! You're a real gem for Mystic Sirius Sect, and this'll keep you out of harm's way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your hard-earned prize! Just bear in mind, you'll have to take it off during the city duel </span><span>'cause</span><span> defense divine artifacts are a no-go in the arena."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, a wave of elation washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A quasi-Sacred Artifact, particularly a defensive one, was an absolute gem. He never would've dreamed that the Mystic Sirius Sect would be so lavish. As the champion, he'd not only bagged a hundred Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> but also this amazing artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was just the in-house competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but wonder, if he could really shine in the upcoming city duel, state duel, or even the zone duel, would there be a Sacred Artifact waiting for him as the grand prize?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought had his excitement levels skyrocketing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the send-off ceremony. The top ten finishers from the Sect Tournament were going to represent the Mystic Sirius Sect in the city duel at Tempest Fortress City, which was scheduled for two weeks later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, Bethan, Jamar, and the rest were each given a special battle robe. These robes were a real head-turner, emblazoned with the Mystic Sirius Sect's emblem and </span><span>sporting a huge wolf's head on the chest, exuding an aura that was nothing short of intimidating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lenny gave everyone a pep talk, voicing his hopes that they'd ace the upcoming city duel. Then, the send-off ceremony wrapped up to the rousing cheers of the Mystic Sirius Sect disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, Osborne was free to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of heading straight back to his room, he made a beeline for the betting table to collect his loot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the top-twenty competition kicked off, Osborne had put down a hundred Sacred Crystals on himself to win the championship, with odds of a hundred to one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, that measly hundred had ballooned into a whopping ten thousand Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he cashed in his bet, he noticed the bookie's face was a picture of misery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne had come out of nowhere like a dark horse and cleaned up in the competition. The bookies had been salivating at the thought of making a fortune, but instead, they were left high and dry, all thanks to Osborne's gutsy bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the perfect example of "easy come, easy go," and they felt like they'd just wasted their time for nothing!</span></p></div>
