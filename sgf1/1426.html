        <h1>Chapter 1425 Soul Resonance Fluid</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The No. 9 mining area sprawled over an impressive 11 thousand square feet, roughly the size of a province in Rosmandi on the Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite its vastness, it was home to only a million miners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire region was divided into hundreds of sectors based on the location of the ore veins and the density of Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The E53 sector, located at the heart of this massive expanse, plunged six miles deep, still considered a shallow mining zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>E53 took the shape of a rectangular prism, stretching about 120 miles in length and 60 miles in width, with depths ranging from three to 12 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A network of tunnels crisscrossed the area, connecting the surface to the depths below. Fortunately, the rock here was incredibly hard; otherwise, such extensive excavation would have led to catastrophic collapses long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Chester and the other overseers led Osborne and his team to the E53 sector, finally stopping in a vast underground chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chester explained, "Mr. Alick, this is where the Deathborn attacked the miners. To maximize our Essence Crystal output each month, we require miners to stay on-site for two weeks at a time, only allowing them to return home every fortnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the resting area for the miners of E53. Unfortunately, when the Deathborn struck, most of them were off guard, just resting. Since many were only Junior Deities, they stood little chance against the attack, which is why the casualties were so high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we hadn't arrived in time, we could have lost over five thousand miners instead of just over a thousand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey surveyed the surroundings, his expression unreadable. "Well done! You've handled this situation well. It's clear this incident isn't on you; in fact, you've done your part. I'll make sure to report this back accurately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chester's last-minute gift of Essence Crystals had clearly paid off, turning his previous mistakes into a semblance of merit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but snicker inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that wherever you find intelligent beings, regardless of their race, greed and politics always come into play."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered this, Osborne began to examine his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed fresh bloodstains and signs of a brutal struggle on the rocks and floor, remnants of the massacre that had taken place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five thousand miners had been no match for the Deathborn; had they not managed to escape quickly, the toll would have been catastrophic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this show on the road! Time to execute the plan!" Jeffrey declared, wasting no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a centurion like him, dealing with Deathborn threats in the mines was old hat; he'd been through it all before and knew the drill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they stuck to the tried and true methods, they should be able to handle the Deathborn without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!" replied the ten squad leaders, including Osborne, as they sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One squad leader produced a special container, placing it at the center of the underground space. The others quickly formed a perimeter around it, focusing on concealing their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, everyone! Pay close attention!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We might be facing a significant number of Transcendent Deity Deathborns this time. If anyone messes this up, I won't hold back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Getting kicked out of the Wild Flame Army will be the least of your worries. If you cause major losses or let the Deathborn swarm slip away, you'll find yourself in military prison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey's voice was icy as he snapped his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A jolt of divine power shot through the chamber, striking the special container at its center. The container shattered into pieces, unleashing a crimson liquid that swirled ominously around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overpowering stench filled the air, a nauseating aroma far more potent than blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instantly recognized it&mdash;it was Soul Resonance Fluid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unique substance radiated an intensely rich life force, holding an unparalleled allure for the Deathborn. Once unleashed, the Soul Resonance Fluid would beckon every Deathborn within a thirty-mile range, waking even those in deep slumber and driving them into a frenzied rush toward the source.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Wild Flame Army, the go-to tactic for handling Deathborn in the mines was precisely this&mdash;using the Soul Resonance Fluid to lure a large number of enemies into a confined space where they could be systematically taken down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More often than not, this method proved successful without fail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, everyone, including Osborne, held their breath, straining to remain utterly still as they awaited the incoming wave of Deathborns, who were drawn by the tantalizing scent of the fluid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So long as the Deathborns were nearby, they couldn't resist the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the tension in the air became palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A distinct vibration resonated from the deeper shadows of the cavern, and everybody's eyes lit up in anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jeffrey's face grew serious at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned toward one of the squad leaders and asked quietly, "Have you measured the energy levels yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The squad leader held a specialized device, scanning the area with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression shifted from focused to alarmed as he said, "Mr. Alick, we have a problem! The energy levels have spiked to forty-eight! It looks like we might face at least ten Transcendent Deity Deathborns, plus a hundred Superior Deity Deathborns! With our current strength, tackling these creatures could be exceedingly dangerous!"</span></p></div>
