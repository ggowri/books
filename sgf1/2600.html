        <h1>Chapter 2489 Stellar Region M72-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are many Stellar Exploration Organizations, Space Pirates, and Space Plunderers there. Even numerous ruthless fugitives hide in the area for years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, even though the Fairy Moon Sect's intelligence network is very powerful, they only know the approximate location of the Frenetic Storm Warband and that they rested on a planet in Stellar Region M72 about six months ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Fairy Moon Sect cannot trace where the Frenetic Storm Warband went afterward. The planet they stayed on six months ago is called Inferno Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela said, "Osborne, the Fairy Moon Sect's intelligence department can only uncover this much. We must personally go to Inferno Planet in Stellar Region M72 and continue investigating the specifics."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was definitely going to Inferno Planet in Stellar Region M72. After all, he finally got news about the Frenetic Storm Warband. If he didn&rsquo;t follow the clues to find them and rescue his parents, he would never find peace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Is there a direct Cosmic Translocator from Racial Convergence Planet to Inferno Planet in Stellar Region M72?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela shook her head and said, "There's no direct Cosmic Translocator from Racial Convergence Planet to Inferno Planet, but there is one to the edge of Stellar Region M72. We can first teleport to the edge of Stellar Region M72 and then figure out a way to get to Inferno Planet. It shouldn't take too long."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, thinking, "As long as I can get there quickly. After all, I still have to participate in the Glorious Divine War in half a year. I can't be away for too long. In that case..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne stood up. "I'll head over now. Angela, please help me thank Ms. Alba for the information. Whether I can find the Frenetic Storm Warband or rescue my parents, I owe her another favor."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela smiled and said, "You'd better thank Ms. Alba in person. Ms. Alba said I should go with you. Stellar Region M72 is chaotic and dangerous. Racial Convergence Planet has its rules."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But in Stellar Region M72, strength is the rule. You haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness yet. If you go to Stellar Region M72 alone, it's too dangerous. Don't argue with me. I know you're strong, but your cultivation level is too low, and it's easy for others to take advantage of you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm currently at mid Empyrean Sacredness and can reach advanced Empyrean Sacredness anytime. If I go with you, you'll face much less trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, this is the task Ms. Alba assigned to me. If you don't let me go with you, I won't be able to report back to Ms. Alba."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Angela looked at Osborne seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly. He knew Stellar Region M72 was dangerous, so he didn't want Angela to go with him, fearing she might get dragged into trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, since Angela had already said so, he couldn't refuse her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Agatha walked out of the room and calmly said, "Osborne, I heard everything. If you're going to save your parents, I'll go with you. Besides, I've been training for too long lately. I want to find a place to stretch a bit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, Osborne was even more speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne agreed. Although Agatha was currently only at primary Empyrean Sacredness, her true strength was about the same as Angela's. After all, she was the Dark Phoenix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne couldn't guarantee that he could definitely defeat Agatha now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With their help, his operation might go more smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said seriously, "Alright. Thank you for being willing to help me and accompany me on this adventure. Don't worry. As long as I'm alive, I won't let you fall into danger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Agatha and Angela smiled and didn't mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the three of them left the inn together and used the translocator in Tempest Fortress City to reach the largest nearby city.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here lies the Cosmic Translocator leading to the edge of Stellar Region M72.</span></p></div>
