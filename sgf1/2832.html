        <h1>Chapter 2678 Allocation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They hadn't seen each other for over a year, but Isa's habits remained unchanged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her strength had increased, and she was even more relentless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, no matter how hard she tried, she would ultimately be defeated by Osborne. Osborne's body was now stronger than a Silicon-based Lifeform at the same cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Isa were a hundred times stronger, she would still have to beg for mercy in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Isa collapsed weakly onto Osborne's chest, resting her face against it, her expression full of contentment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, you're even more amazing!" At this moment, Isa gazed seductively at Osborne's face, her eyes seemingly unable to hold anything else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stroked her smooth back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne, the pleasure of breaking through the cultivation level was intense, even surpassing that of physical intimacy. However, Osborne preferred the ecstasy of being with Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because it was not just a physical connection but a fusion of souls. This emotional exchange was something he could never experience when breaking through the cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How have you been lately?" Osborne started chatting with Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long while, Isa got up, dressed, and blushed shyly. "Go find Clarissa and the others. During this time, not only did I miss you, but they missed you too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Isa's words, Osborne stood up and held her in his arms. "Alright. After I meet with them, we'll talk more."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne went straight into Clarissa's room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He unleashed a surge of power, enveloping the entire room to prevent any sound from escaping or being spied upon. Then, under Clarissa's delighted gaze, he held her tightly, kissed her lips, gently laid her on the bed, and began a fusion of body and soul.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could feel Clarissa's immense excitement as she eagerly responded to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Clarissa also begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After chatting for a while, Osborne appeared in Emma's room, then Austin's room, and finally Anita's room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After "subduing" five women, Osborne then woke up Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Kendra, Bryce, Hannah, and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all extremely happy to see Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, why did you come to Fairy Moon Sect? Didn't you refuse to join Fairy Moon Sect and become Ms. Alba's disciple? Have you changed your mind?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I joined here before you. So, I'll be your senior sister from now on," Anastasia said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne patted her head and said with a smile, "You want to be my senior sister? I think you're asking for trouble. However, this time, I'll have to disappoint you. I am indeed part of Fairy Moon Sect now, but I'm not Ms. Alba's disciple."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Anastasia's expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She frowned and said, "How could this be? Did Ms. Alba refuse to take you as her disciple? How is that possible? Osborne, your talent is far greater than ours. Since Ms. Alba is willing to take us as disciples, how could she possibly refuse you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll go find Ms. Alba. No matter what, I will convince her to take you as her disciple."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying that, Anastasia was about to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Silly girl, it's not that I don't want to take Osborne as my disciple, but I am no longer qualified to do so. His strength now should be about the same as mine." At this moment, Adriana walked in with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba!" Everyone quickly stood up and bowed to Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what, they were Adriana's disciples. During this time, Adriana took great care of them and taught them many things. Therefore, they respected Adriana deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana waved her hand. "No need to be so formal. Otherwise, Osborne might blame me for not treating you well enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne touched his nose, feeling a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Anastasia widened her eyes and said, "Ms. Alba, what did you just say? Did you say Osborne's strength is about the same as yours? How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are the strongest warrior on Racial Convergence Planet. Except for the three who have reached Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, no one can match you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anastasia clearly didn't believe Adriana's words, and neither did the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Osborne used the Sublime Concealment Orb to hide his cultivation level and energy, they still don't know his true cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne smiled and said, "Ms. Alba's words are a bit exaggerated. My current strength is still quite far from Ms. Alba's."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne withdrew the effect of the Sublime Concealment Orb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, the energy of Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection spread out, leaving everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection?" Isa was also stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "No wonder I felt Osborne was stronger than before. Turns out, Osborne's cultivation level has surpassed mine by so much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa took just over a year to break through from Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King to advanced Empyrean Sacredness, so she originally thought her cultivation level had already surpassed Osborne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne gave them a huge shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone felt a bit envious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My words are not an exaggeration," Adriana looked at Osborne. "Although your cultivation level is only at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, which is lower than mine, your actual strength is almost the same as mine. If I were at the same cultivation level as you, I would probably be easily defeated by you. On the entire Racial Convergence Planet, among those at the same cultivation level as you, no one could be your match, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana felt a bit emotional. "When I invited you to become the Honorary Elder of Fairy Moon Sect, I was merely optimistic about your future, but I never expected your future to arrive so quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne awkwardly touched his nose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his heart, Adriana had always been a respected senior. Being praised like this by a senior made him feel a bit embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly changed the topic. "By the way, I got some good stuff in the Skyfall Casket. You guys can divide them up. With these, I believe your cultivation level will soon catch up to me, maybe even surpass me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne took out a pile of emperor fruits, numbering three to four hundred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The spiritual energy emanating from the emperor fruits instantly stunned Isa, Clarissa, and the others, making them feel as if all their pores had opened up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Adriana was deeply shocked. "Emperor fruits? You actually obtained so many emperor fruits in the Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "This isn't much, just a few hundred. These emperor fruits are just enough for each of you to have thirty. I believe they are enough to quickly elevate each of your cultivation levels to Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They might even help you reach Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness or Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, everyone was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They each get thirty emperor fruits? Are these emperor fruits enough to elevate them to Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, or even Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness or Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all took a deep breath, extremely excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, I'm going to cultivate right now," Anastasia said excitedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm going too!" the others echoed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa also said confidently, "Honey, I'm going to cultivate too. I won't stop until I break through to Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After receiving the emperor fruits, they stopped chatting with Osborne and immediately went to cultivate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, only Osborne and Adriana were left in the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne took out another hundred emperor fruits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and said, "Ms. Alba, you should be close to reaching Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, right? Can these hundred emperor fruits help you achieve it?"</span></p></div>
