        <h1>Chapter 1864 Seth on Death's Door</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Seth finished speaking, the group of a dozen or so people immediately grew excited. Osborne felt like he was suddenly surrounded. Among them, at least six were women&mdash;his mother, Vivienne's elder sisters, who were also his aunts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, all six of them clung tightly to Osborne. Some grabbed his arms, others held onto his clothes. Their faces were full of joy and excitement, their eyes red with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them asked tearfully, "Is this really Vivienne's child? He's grown so much already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another chimed in, "He's so handsome&mdash;definitely takes after Vivienne. Though... there's a bit of Theodore, that bastard, in him too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone else added, "Exactly. Vivienne's child had to be good-looking. Just like how she was always prettier than the rest of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another asked, "Sweetheart, how old are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them said eagerly, "How did you find us? Quick, call me Aunt. I'm your mom's eldest sister, Alicia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another followed up, saying, "I'm your second aunt, your mom's second sister. My name is Nadia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest quickly jumped in, enthusiastically introducing themselves one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood frozen, completely at a loss. Facing the overwhelming warmth of his six aunts, he didn't know what to do. He had never experienced anything like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a commanding voice cut through the chaos. "Hey, don't crowd over him like that!" Zachary said sternly, his expression serious. "What are you all doing? Vivienne's child just got here&mdash;don't scare him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six women, looking a bit sheepish, quickly let go of Osborne. But their reddened eyes stayed fixed on him, filled with affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary continued, "Step aside. It's the uncles' turn to get a good look at him." The aunts rolled their eyes at him but moved aside begrudgingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Zachary and eleven other men stepped forward, each giving Osborne a firm pat on the shoulder. Zachary declared, "Very well! Kid, from now on, the Hudson family is your family now. Your mom is our little sis, and that makes you one of us. If anyone dares mess with you, let me know. Your uncle's got your back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men took turns introducing themselves one by one, their warmth overwhelming Osborne. For the first time, he felt the genuine embrace of family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could fully process the moment, Seth, lying on the hospital bed, suddenly coughed violently and spat out a mouthful of blood. Immediately, panicked voices filled the room, calling out to him. "Seth!" "Father!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone turned to look at Seth. His face was pale as a sheet of paper, and the faint, almost nonexistent trace of life left in him was chilling. They didn't care about Osborne anymore, rushing to Seth's side with heavy expressions. They all felt it&mdash;Seth wasn't going to make it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth managed a weak smile, saying, "Guys... I think I'm going to go ahead of you. I don't think I can hold on any longer." His words only deepened the sorrow. Grief etched itself onto every face in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, his voice trembling but calm, "Don't be sad. Everyone dies eventually. Even if someone becomes a Deity King or a Supernal Deity King, they still can't escape life and death. I'm just going ahead of you, that's all. To hear news about Vivienne and to meet her child before I go&mdash;it's more than enough for me. I'm content. I'll be going on ahead now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth's tone grew softer as he spoke again, "From now on, I'll have to trouble all of you to take care of Tristan for me. And... please, protect the Hudson family, protect the whole Human Community. Also... make sure to find Vivienne. Lastly, if you run into that bastard Theodore, do me a favor and give him a good beating. I... I'm leaving now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Seth spoke, the last remnants of his vitality began slipping away, like water pouring from an opened faucet. His body resembled a burnt-out candle, its final light flickering and dimming. He gave one last look at Tristan and then at Osborne before smiling faintly and closing his eyes for the last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All at once, the crowd erupted with shouts of "Seth!" "Father!" They stood frozen, watching as Seth's life force drained away, unable to do a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family had faced so many injuries recently. Their stock of white Miracle Elixir had long been depleted, and there was no way to acquire more in time. They could only stand by, powerless, as Seth's life ebbed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every pair of eyes in the room turned red with tears. Tristan, in particular, broke down, sobbing uncontrollably as he clung tightly to Seth's arm, unwilling to let him go. But no one could change the inevitable. Soon, the air in the room grew thick with grief and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne finally spoke up, "Uncles, aunts, step aside, please. Uncle Seth isn't gone yet&mdash;he can still be saved." His words struck like thunder, shocking everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all turned to him, their faces lighting up with a sliver of hope. "Osborne, what... what did you say? You mean he can still be saved?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly, offering no explanation as he squeezed past the crowd to Seth's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth's vitality was all but gone. Under normal circumstances, he was beyond saving&mdash;no amount of white Miracle Elixir would have been enough to bring him back. But Osborne wasn't like anyone else. He had ways, plenty of them. "Step back, all of you," he said.</span></p></div>
