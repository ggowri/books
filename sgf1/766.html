        <h1>Chapter 766 The Power of the Godson</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Jackie finished speaking, a figure swiftly leaped onto the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Clay Rosenthal!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was the third-ranked Godson from Yalynch. Just yesterday, he fought an intense battle with Satoru here, ending in a draw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once on the stage, Clay fixed his sharp gaze on Emi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Emi Byrd, I challenge you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi seemed to have expected to be the first challenged. After all, she ranked at the bottom of the Global Godson Rankings, making her appear to be the weakest and easiest target.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without any hesitation, she calmly walked onto the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Clay and let out a cold laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clay, you couldn't even beat Satoru Byrd, and you dare challenge me? You're asking for trouble! Do you really think being ranked 499 means I'm the easiest to beat?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'll regret this decision!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without waiting for a reply, Emi launched her attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dark Realm!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her terrifying Dark Realm instantly enveloped the entire stage, even pulling in some spectators near the edges of the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The scope of her realm alone far surpassed that of Satoru.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd couldn't help but gasp in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satoru stood among the crowd, a smirk of disdain curling at his lips as he watched Clay foolishly challenge Emi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What an idiot. Does he think Emi is the easiest target? She's only ranked low because she doesn't care to climb the rankings. Her strength could easily be around 460, maybe higher!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clay, you've already lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Dark Realm engulfed the entire platform, leaving the spectators unaware of what was happening. A bright flash of light flickered inside the darkness for a moment, but it quickly faded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon after, the Dark Realm dissolved, leaving behind a single figure collapsed on the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That figure was...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was somewhat surprised. He could see that Clay had been stunned when Emi's Dark Realm surrounded him. Instead of giving up, Clay unleashed his Light Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, Clay's Light Realm wasn't strong enough to overpower Emi's Dark Realm. It weakened the darkness but couldn't break through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, Emi easily used her dark energy to severely injure Clay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What incredible power!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne muttered to himself, wondering if his own Light Realm could stand up to Emi's Dark Realm if he were the one challenging her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe it could?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had doubts, as he had only recently gained control of the Light Realm. Theoretically, it wasn't as powerful as Clay's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, his Light Element Essence was incredibly powerful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's Light Realm had always been strong and stable, far beyond Clay's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still, Osborne hadn't fully tested its limits, so he wasn't entirely confident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Emi Byrd wins!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jackie reappeared, smiling as he said, "Anyone else wants to challenge? Let's keep things moving."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Satoru rushed onto the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pointing to a man in the crowd, he declared, "Samuel Hughes, I challenge you! You're ranked 479 on the Global Godson Rankings, but I believe my powers are a perfect counter to yours! From now on, your spot will be mine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satoru's eyes burned with battle intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Samuel stood up with a cold snort. "You think your powers can counter mine? Ridiculous! In the face of absolute strength, there's no such thing as a counter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've got guts challenging me, but I'll show you just how outclassed you are!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Samuel stepped onto the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satoru and Samuel clashed in an instant, with Satoru's Dark Realm going up against Samuel's Star Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Star Realm was a variation of the Light Realm, but it wasn't as pure. The stars dimmed under the shadow of the darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear that the Dark Realm had some advantage over the Star Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Samuel's strength was immense. With the power of his Star Realm, he shattered Satoru's Dark Realm by sheer force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satoru's expression shifted immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Samuel sneered. "Without your realm, you're nothing but trash in front of me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Samuel began to beat Satoru mercilessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satoru tried to fight back, even pulling out an ancient artifact, but Samuel had one of his own. It did nothing to change the fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, Satoru was beaten down by Samuel, left bruised and battered before being kicked off the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Trash, and you dare challenge me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Samuel looked around the crowd with arrogance, as if warning anyone who might challenge him that they would meet the same fate as Satoru.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His display of power was enough to intimidate everyone watching below the stage.</p></div>
