        <h1>Chapter 1124 A World Full of Vitality</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the Augustine family had plenty of members. At that moment, everyone </span><span>sprang into action, uprooting the rapidly growing trees around their homes to prevent any damage to their buildings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that was about all they could manage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire Augustine Estate was transforming at an astonishing pace, with various structures gradually becoming shrouded in the thick foliage, as if they had stepped into a jungle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne noticed many family members who had been vigorously clearing weeds and digging up trees just moments before suddenly sitting cross-legged on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, they were breaking through their limits!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a short span, he sensed numerous members of the Augustine family achieving breakthroughs to Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of power surged around him, each one a testament to their rapid advancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but exclaim, "What a vibrant world this is! Compared to this, the old Blue Planet felt so dull and lifeless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled and nodded, saying, "Don't worry; this situation is only temporary. We're in a period of mutation right now. The plants and animals on Blue Planet have suddenly been infused with an enormous amount of energy, which will naturally lead to evolution! But once they adapt to these changes, things will settle down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It should last about three months to half a year at most!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After that, the world will stabilize. During these six months, various factions will be busy adapting to the new world, while the gods and Dark Deities will be focused on regaining their strength. This is your last peaceful time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Half a year, huh? I need to make the most of this time to level up and prepare for the chaos that might come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa beamed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you're so clever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit embarrassed, Osborne chuckled. "Let's go meet the God of Star and... Clarissa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was currently with the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they entered the dungeon, they quickly found him. The God of Star was bathed in a cascade of starlight, his power rapidly recovering, growing stronger by the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he sensed Osborne and Isa's arrival, he opened his eyes wide in surprise and respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night, you've come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed deeply to Isa, his gaze filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Isn't the God of Star a true deity? Why is he showing such deference to Isa? But then again, Isa is the disciple of the God of Night, one of the Seven Deity Kings, so it makes sense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied calmly, "Yes, I'm here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must have felt the changes in the world, right? I've come to help you reshape your Divine Body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star's excitement was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night, I can already sense the changes! The concentration of star power has finally returned to a level comparable to the Age of Gods! In this situation, I could reshape my body on my own, but it would take quite a while. If you could assist me in reshaping my Divine Body, I would be eternally grateful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry; the Divine Body I'm going to help you reshape will be far stronger than your previous body! After all, I had you contribute the light elemental essence before, so it's only fair I compensate you for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, the God of Star became even more excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, looked at Isa with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the light elemental essence you gave me originally belonged to the God of Star?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa met his gaze with a confirming nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit guilty, Osborne turned his eyes toward the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star assured him quickly, "Osborne, there's no need to feel guilty. That was willingly given! Plus, once my Divine Body is reshaped, I'll be able to reassemble the light elemental essence, and even improve further. It's a good deal for me too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you so much, God of Star," Osborne said earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he glanced at Clarissa, noting she had broken through to Class S yet remained unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concern flickered in his eyes. "Is she going to be okay?" Osborne asked Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm demeanor, Isa replied, "She's fine! This is a positive sign; we might have another ally on our hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not giving Osborne a chance to ask more questions, she turned to the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get started!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, pay attention! If you want to truly become a deity, you need both divine power and a Divine Body. Your path is unique; all you need is a complete Divine Body, and you can step into divinity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, watch closely as I reshape his Divine Body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Isa sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her hand, and an overwhelming surge of star power began to gather around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, such an immense amount of star power would have drained the entire Rosmandi region dry, but now, she only needed to draw from the star power above Newport City, which was more than enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, every last bit of star power vanished from the sky above Newport City, completely under Isa's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, utterly stunned.</span></p></div>
