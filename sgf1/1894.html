        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the eight tokens floated into the air, each one shimmering with a captivating glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, Anastasia, Zoe, and even Hannah each received one, their faces lighting up with sheer excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, ever the sweet one, asked, "Are these really for us, Grandpa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's grin stretched wide, and he chimed in, calling Jethro "Grandpa" with a sugary tone that made everyone chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can the Divine Ascendance Technique sealed within actually take on someone like Trevor, a Supernal Deity King?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others chimed in with their thanks, all equally thrilled by the unexpected gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne's uncles and aunts looked on with envy, their eyes glistening with a mix of longing and playful resentment as they cast glances at Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, this is so unfair! We asked you for the Gale of Netherworld's Divine Mark before, and you wouldn't give it to us! You said sealing it in tokens was incredibly difficult and insisted we rely on our own strength instead! But now, your grandson shows up, and you just hand out eight tokens like it's nothing! Talk about favoritism!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We, your own children, don't get anything!" Zachary exclaimed, his voice tinged with playful indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alicia and Nadia nodded in agreement, their expressions mirroring Zachary's discontent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro shot them a stern look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you compare yourselves to them? If you had the same talent as Osborne and his friends, I'd gladly give you each one, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary and the others fell silent, unable to counter that logic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a twinge of guilt; he had thought the tokens were easy to create since his grandpa had produced eight of them so effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now it dawned on him that sealing the Divine Mark within the tokens and embedding the Divine Ascendance Technique was no small feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh, Grandpa, I really could manage without relying on these," Osborne said, hesitating as he considered returning the token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others nodded reluctantly. "Grandpa, thank you for your kindness! But we can't accept such valuable gifts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Jethro frowned, shooting another glare at Zachary and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he smiled and said, "What's all this fuss about value? It's just a little gift! Something to help keep you safe! Since you all call me 'Grandpa' like Osborne does, how could I not give you something?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't take them, I might just get upset!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He feigned a pout, crossing his arms dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and the others exchanged glances, clearly torn. They looked to Osborne for guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of deliberation, he decided, "Let's just accept them! This is Grandpa's goodwill, and we can't let him get upset."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement, their expressions softening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Grandpa! Thank you!" they chorused, their voices filled with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro beamed with delight. "Alright then! Since I'm in such a good mood today, I'll show you a demonstration of the Gale of Netherworld so you can see what it's all about! That way, you'll know exactly what to expect when you use the tokens!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded eagerly, anticipation bubbling in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was particularly curious about what his grandpa's Gale of Netherworld would look like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this was a Divine Ascendance Technique!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, this area is a bit cramped, so I'll control the power of the Gale of Netherworld to just one percent of its normal strength. I mainly want you to see how it attacks!" Jethro explained, rising above the expansive training grounds of the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch closely!" he called out, his voice booming with authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Jethro waved his hand, and intricate, mesmerizing patterns began to materialize in the sky. To Osborne, these designs seemed utterly chaotic, yet they radiated an undeniable beauty. In an instant, the air above the training grounds was enveloped in a shimmering veil of azure lines, glowing with an ethereal light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, just as suddenly, the patterns vanished, appearing to dissolve into the very fabric of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next heartbeat, a chilling wind howled through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying gale felt as though it had torn free from the depths of hell itself, sweeping across the training grounds in a matter of moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky darkened, and all that could be heard was the sinister wailing of the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne and the others stood at a distance, far from the tangible force of the Gale of Netherworld, they felt a sharp sting coursing through their bodies. An icy layer formed on their skin, and it felt as if their very souls were on the verge of freezing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Gale of Netherworld howled, lasting several breaths before it finally subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the dust settled, the Hudson family's training grounds bore the scars of a cataclysmic event, resembling a place that had weathered a devastating disaster. Everywhere they looked, there were signs of destruction and an eerie chill that lingered in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, that's powerful!" one of them exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could we even withstand such an attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! Not even with Ultimate Luminous Armor or Supreme Sovereign's Armor could we hold up against that!" someone else chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this kind of terrifying wind, we wouldn't last long at all!" another added, shivering at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone gasped, "Unbelievable! Is this really what a Divine Ascendance Technique looks like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this is just one percent of its power? If the full Gale of Netherworld were unleashed, it could wipe us out in an instant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others stood frozen, their expressions a mix of awe and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro, maintaining his calm demeanor, looked at them and said, "See? That's the Gale of Netherworld for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's an ultimate attack, and there are plenty of Supernal Deity Kings in Celestara who can unleash such power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, when you venture out, remember to stay alert and be cautious!"</span></p></div>
