        <h1>Chapter 2287 Throw Down the Gauntlet-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked a bit taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Seems like Gustave and Malcolm know each other, and they're like oil and water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't dwell on it for long. Gustave had stepped up for him, and there was no way he'd just stand by and let Gustave get dissed by Malcolm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne strode forward, squared up to Malcolm, and said in a cool, steely tone, "Malcolm, right? I've got no clue why you're so hell-bent on provoking me, but I've gotta say, you've really gotten my goat! You claimed I thought you weren't good enough to invite me to team up, and that I'd teach you a lesson in the state duel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine then! I didn't say those things before, but now, I'm making it a promise! You sorry bunch of losers aren't even in the same league as me. You're not fit to ask me to join your team. And if you cross my path in the state duel, I'll beat you black and blue!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't believe me, just sit tight and watch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne looked down his nose at Malcolm, pure disdain in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm was left gobsmacked. He never saw this coming, never expected Osborne to talk to him like that, to be so ballsy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his face turned as dark as a storm cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers, upon hearing Osborne's words, couldn't help but let out gasps of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is going on?" someone blurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne actually had the balls to talk to Malcolm like that? Malcolm's a top-100 powerhouse! He's ranked 80th on the strength leaderboard, twenty-three spots ahead of Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the real issue ain't Malcolm. It's Conrad! Malcolm's part of Conrad's team, and Conrad's ranked 15th. Will he just sit back and let his teammate get dissed by Osborne like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's toast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Conrad's face turned as cold as ice when he heard what Osborne had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his steely gaze on Osborne and said, "Osborne, you're way too full of yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sneering laugh. "Me? Arrogant? Aren't you guys the ones who are full of it? I was just chilling in my lodgings with a sign saying I was already on a team and wasn't looking to join another. But you guys barged in, bugging me to join your team, and the offer you threw at me was just thirty thousand Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You acted like you were doing me a huge favor just by inviting me. I turned you down, and then you thought I was being disrespectful, that I was the arrogant one?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if that's how you see it, then I'll show you what real arrogance looks like! Who the hell do you think you are, Conrad? Why are you strutting around like a big shot? If you've got the guts, let's settle this in the state duel. Name the spot, and if you don't show up, you're a spineless coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished his tirade, the crowd went wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Clara and Gustave were gawking at Osborne like he'd grown a second head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne's actually challenging Conrad? Are you kidding me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's ranked 108th, and Conrad's sitting pretty at 15th. There's a huge gulf in their strength, and Conrad's got at least four top-100 teammates backing him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell has gotten into Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's like he's just asking for a one-way ticket to the grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, in the state duel, killing's off-limits, and there are Empyrean Sacredness referees lurking in the shadows, ready to jump in and save anyone who gets their ass kicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But battles are unpredictable; shit happens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In past state duels, plenty of contestants have bitten the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's poking the bear like this. Isn't he worried Conrad'll take his head off? With Conrad's whole crew in the mix, if they decide to finish Osborne off, the refs might not even have a chance to intervene.</span></p></div>
