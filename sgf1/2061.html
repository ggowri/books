        <h1>Chapter 2053 Elf Tree</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held no grudge against Jaden and Renata for their earlier inaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was a member of the Elf Race's Royal Family who had confronted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood their choice to stand aside; self-preservation made sense in this perilous situation. Even he would have weighed the odds and likely refrained from jumping into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a world that rarely offered comforting illusions, it was impractical to expect Jaden and Renata to risk angering a member of the Elf Royal Family simply because they were all part of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Solidarity among humans was always a mirage in this complex realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was keenly aware that the term "Human Community" embraced a broad spectrum of attitudes and behaviors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Lord Malevolence and the Paramount Supreme Clan fell under this umbrella, they also looked down on the indigenous Human Community in Celestara, treating them as lesser beings to be exploited or exterminated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unity among humans only emerged when it aligned with shared interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When those interests diverged, individuals were more likely to trample each other than lend a helping hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of significant risks, individuals naturally considered whether the reward was commensurate with their personal sacrifice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden and Renata likely sensed that aiding Osborne might come at too high a cost, and indeed, he couldn't blame them for being cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't expect to forge a genuine friendship with them after this. He merely turned to Letitia, who had discreetly signaled him earlier, and mouthed a word of thanks before venturing alone into Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't enemies, yet they certainly wouldn't be allies either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh..." Letitia raised her hand, as if to stop Osborne, but Jaden quickly intercepted her with a shake of his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said firmly, "Let him go. Letitia, this isn't your first time in Elf City. You should know the score by now&mdash;this place is ruled by members of the Elf Royal Family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Osborne has already offended Desmond, a prince of the Fire Elf Clan! If we get too close to him and Desmond's people find out, we could get pulled into his mess. You know how volatile the Fire Elf Clan can be. We really shouldn't get involved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia bit her lip, visibly distressed. "But Jaden, Desmond apologized to Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He admitted he was wrong! He even offered Osborne a VIP card in recompense! A card like that is a big deal&mdash;none of the elders in the Dutt family even have one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He wouldn't have given it unless he planned to let it go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden chuckled, "Letitia, you're being naive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you honestly think Desmond was sincere? He simply didn't want to provoke Princess Joanna. Everyone in Elf City knows he's been chasing her relentlessly; of course, he'll play nice for her sake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the fact that he apologized means he's more furious with Osborne than ever! Desmond is a proud prince of the Fire Elf Clan; being forced to apologize is a blow to his ego. He'll be looking for a chance to retaliate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne had better get out of Elf City now, or else, he's in over his head."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden sighed heavily, "I mean, he's just a newcomer from a tiny planet. I suspect he's used to being on top there, blissfully unaware of what it means to play nice down here. So, of course, he'd think he could stand up to Desmond without facing consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's just hope Desmond doesn't decide to kill him outright but instead leaves him a little wounded to learn his lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia was increasingly anxious, teeth biting into her lip as she watched Osborne's retreating back, worry etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had entered Elf City with no intention of leaving immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden said, "Let's go! It's time to head back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's been talk of a mysterious Umbra Earth near Elf City! This place is said to be unique, only accessible to those under three hundred years of cultivation. Our purpose for visiting Elf City is to assist the family head in exploring this Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can uncover some treasures there, our family's strength will soar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jaden led Renata and Letitia into the heart of Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne stood at the edge of the city, gazing up in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him sprawled a vast jungle, where towering trees stretched endlessly into the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the smallest among them reached nearly ten thousand yards, while the largest loomed like a colossal giant, its canopy casting a shadow over half the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nestled among these giants were countless treehouses, some perched on branches, others nestled in the treetops, creating a wondrous spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Massive branches connected the trees, forming natural walkways that wove through the lush greenery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, his voice tinged with disbelief, "So, this is Elf City? A city built among such gigantic trees?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of absorbing the sight, he collected his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where should I go from here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked Primordial, who had a wealth of knowledge about Elf City thanks to the memories gained from the Eighth World Tree offshoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial said, "First, find a place to settle down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These aren't just ordinary trees; they're called Elf Trees. Any buildings constructed on them benefit from their protection. Training within these trees is significantly faster, and your comprehension will improve as well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The larger the Elf Tree, the more potent the effects! Of course, the more impressive the tree, the steeper the price. Since you didn't bring any Celestial Crystals, just find a regular Elf Tree and rent a room there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, quickly spotting the nearest Elf Tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It stood at a modest height of ten thousand yards, making it one of the smaller trees in Elf City, adorned with a few hundred humble treehouses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very top of this tree hung a sign: [Emerald Forest Lodge].</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this particular Elf Tree looked a bit desolate; unlike the bustling surroundings, it seemed devoid of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, Osborne decided to approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excuse me, are you looking to rent a treehouse?" A cheerful female elf appeared before him, her striking features framed by pointed ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was petite, barely reaching Osborne's waist, yet her smile was warm and inviting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She introduced herself with a twinkle in her eye, "I'm Alfreda Rivera of the Nature Elf Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Elf Tree, known as Alfreda Tree, is under my care! We have a total of 250 treehouses available. The cheapest one only costs ten Celestial Crystals for a year! The higher the treehouse, the pricier it gets, but the maximum is just a hundred Celestial Crystals for the best ones...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda Tree's accommodations are the most affordable in all of Elf City! You won't find a better deal than this, and I promise they're clean!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an eager expression, Alfreda asked, "So, would you like to rent a treehouse?"</span></p></div>
