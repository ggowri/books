        <h1>Chapter 2105 True Power</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne standing protectively in front of her, Alfreda felt a wave of relief wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that relief quickly turned to alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She urged, her eyes wide with concern, "Osborne, get out of the way! They're all Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings! You can't hold them back! I can handle this&mdash;just let me fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she wiped the blood from her lips, ready to rejoin the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne stepped in front of her, blocking her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're injured! You need to heal first. I'll take care of them. You've always been curious about my true power, right? Now you'll see it for yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze hardened as he focused on the four attackers. "Come at me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pierce, Nell, Killian, and Harley exchanged glances, a mix of disbelief and disdain on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pierce scoffed, a mocking smile spreading across his face. "What a joke. You think you can stop us? If you want to die, we'll gladly oblige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll take you out first, then finish off Princess Alfreda! You both will fall here today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human trash, prepare to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pierce raised his hand, summoning a terrifying bolt of lightning that shot straight toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King specializing in Thunder Power, Pierce's attack was formidable&mdash;far stronger than Nell, Killian, or Harley. He had been the one to break through Alfreda's divine power defenses earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pierce sneered at Osborne, viewing him as nothing more than an Ascension One Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, a casual strike from him would turn Osborne into nothing but a charred corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell, Killian, and Harley shared his sentiments, their expressions cold as they regarded Osborne like a dead man walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning struck Osborne, the sound echoing through the air, but instead of the expected sight of him being obliterated, something astonishing happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bolt didn't kill him; rather, it was caught in his palm, crackling and twisting obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pierce's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked down at the lightning in his hand, a calm smile on his face. He mused, "After breaking through to Level Nine of lightning elemental essence, my control over lightning has become incredibly strong! Even Pierce, as an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, can't harm me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is what it means to be an Ascension Five, huh? Even without the absolute forbidden zone to suppress your cultivation level, I can handle you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne shot a cold smile at Pierce. "Is this all you've got?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this level of power, you dare to call me trash?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To label me as worthless? How laughable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me show you what a real waste is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flicked his wrist, sending the lightning soaring into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bolt exploded upward, drawing in surrounding lightning energy, growing exponentially larger&mdash;hundreds, even thousands of times its original size&mdash;forming a terrifying purple-red storm cloud that hovered ominously above Pierce and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Osborne's control, the purple-red lightning twisted and writhed, devouring the ambient lightning elements, becoming increasingly potent and menacing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pierce's face turned pale as he looked up at the swirling tempest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?! You're just at Ascension One... no, Ascension Two at best! How can your control over lightning be this advanced?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you be so much stronger than me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be happening!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Pierce realized the overwhelming power of the purple-red storm was beyond his capacity to handle, his panic set in. He turned to flee, desperately trying to distance himself from the impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strike down!" With a cold snort, Osborne pointed a finger, and the massive purple-red lightning that hung in the air descended like a judgment from the heavens, homing in on Pierce as if it had locked onto his very essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of the lightning was blinding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pierce's face drained of color as he realized he had no chance to evade it. In a desperate bid for survival, he unleashed all his divine power, attempting to shield himself while channeling lightning elemental essence to counter the oncoming storm, hoping to absorb its might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, a wave of terror washed over him as he realized the futility of his efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't budge the lightning Osborne had summoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Pierce screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the terrifying bolt struck Pierce, exploding with a blinding flash of purple-red light. The sound was deafening, shaking the very ground beneath them. Lightning snakes shot out in all directions, sending Nell, Killian, and Harley flying, crashing hard to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All three spat blood as they hit the earth, but compared to Pierce, they were the lucky ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where he once stood now lay a massive charred crater, and in the center of it, a blackened, broken corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was... Pierce!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had obliterated the Ascension Five Supernal Deity King with a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A satisfied smile crept across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With my cultivation level at Ascension Two and lightning elemental essence upgraded to Level Nine, my strength has skyrocketed! In the past, to take down someone like Pierce, I'd have to go all out&mdash;absolute forbidden zone, Spatial Clone, </span><span>all of </span><span>the works. Now... one move is all it takes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reveled in his newfound power, oblivious to Alfreda, who was wide-eyed behind him, her face a mask of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had killed Pierce in one blow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even she, with all her power, knew it wouldn't be easy to take Pierce down in a single strike. She had thought that if Osborne could just hold Pierce off long enough for her to recover, that would be a significant achievement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had killed Pierce in one hit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda inhaled sharply, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell, Killian, and Harley, slowly getting back on their feet, shared her disbelief, their eyes filled with terror as they gazed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They mused, "Is this really an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this the human we have once dismissed as weak?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Ascension Two Supernal Deity King taking out an Ascension Five in one fell swoop?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wished desperately that it had all been an illusion, but the truth was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After obliterating Pierce, Osborne's cold gaze shifted to the remaining three. "You three can join him in death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was frigid as he drew out the Bloodwrought Bow, three spatial arrows materializing on its string, aimed directly at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through the trio as they felt Osborne's murderous intent and the terrifying energy radiating from the arrows. They were gripped by fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shadow Metamorphosis!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frost Crystal Enclosure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Immortal Shroud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a frantic attempt to defend themselves, they unleashed their ultimate techniques, enveloping themselves in powerful barriers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the spatial arrows shot forth, flashing as they struck their defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The barriers shattered like glass, and in an instant, the three figures were pierced by the arrows, exploding violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the chaos of Space Collapse, nothing remained of them&mdash;only silence and the aftermath of Osborne's wrath.</span></p></div>
