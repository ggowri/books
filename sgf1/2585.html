        <h1>Chapter 2478 Lionel's Methods-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned his icy gaze toward Lionel on the other side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Lionel had already reached the Kingdom Duel Badge, his face full of excitement and exhilaration. Without hesitation, he reached out and grabbed the Kingdom Duel Badge that originally belonged to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He laughed and said, "Hahaha! Your Kingdom Duel Badge is mine now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And your over 46 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints are all mine too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel quickly stored the badge in the Dimensional Bag, as if fearing an accident might occur.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he completely failed to notice that the moment he grabbed the Kingdom Duel Badge, a dazzling ocular energy flashed through Osborne's eyes and quickly vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel slowly turned around, his gaze coldly fixed on Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne's palm covered in blood and filled with fine cuts, with the Void Sword floating before him radiating immense power, making Osborne dare not touch it, he couldn't help but burst into laughter, his voice echoing in the empty space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He laughed and said, "You fell for it after all. You dared to try and make a deal with me? Do you even deserve it? You're too young, too naive! You can't even begin to imagine how powerful a Warrior who has trained for ten thousand years to reach Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection truly is, or how many methods they possess."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think erasing the imprint on the Void Sword means you can easily obtain it? How utterly ridiculous. I have countless ways to ensure you don't even qualify to touch it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And now, your Kingdom Duel Badge is in my hands, while my Void Sword remains beyond your reach. Everything belongs to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even your life is mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will never let you go. With your talent, if given enough time, perhaps one day your strength and cultivation level might surpass mine. By then, if you seek revenge, it would be a disaster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, will you choose to step onto the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, or let me take your life myself?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the words fell, Lionel's face twisted with a ferocious expression, stepping closer to Osborne step by step.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying killing intent and pressure engulfed Osborne like a towering mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly, pretending to be angry and shouted loudly, "Lionel, you</span><span>'</span><span>re so shameless! Using such despicable means to deceive me. Do you have any humanity left?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel sneered dismissively. "So what if I deceived you? Your mistake was possessing this wealth in the first place. With your strength and background, you can</span><span>'</span><span>t protect it. Even if I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t trick you, someone else would take it away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Enough nonsense! Now, it</span><span>'</span><span>s your turn to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the words finished, Lionel was ready to strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at that moment, his expression suddenly changed, and he swiftly turned around. He saw over a dozen incredibly powerful figures instantly appear in his sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the group that had been pursuing Osborne all along, finally arriving at the scene.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They lacked spatial power and the Void Sword, a Supreme Sacred Artifact capable of traversing time and space, so their speed was slower as they tracked Osborne's aura all the way here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne, their eyes instantly lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, their gaze shifted to Lionel, filled with hostility.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand over the Kingdom Duel Badge! Or die!" an elder shouted sharply at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pointed at Lionel and shouted, "Kingdom Duel Badge? You're already too late. My Kingdom Duel Badge was taken by Lionel long ago. He traded it with me for the Void Sword but deceived me. Now, he has kept my Kingdom Duel Badge, and I can't take his Void Sword at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, a dozen gazes instantly turned to Lionel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Lionel's expression was grim, he remained calm and said flatly, "He's right. You're indeed too late. His Kingdom Duel Badge now belongs to me. So, you can leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as these words were spoken, everyone</span><span>'</span><span>s eyes turned icy. "Lionel? That</span><span>'</span><span>s probably a fake name! No matter who you are, that kid</span><span>'</span><span>s Kingdom Duel Badge isn</span><span>'</span><span>t something you can keep for yourself!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand it over! Or die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a dozen people erupted with overwhelming killing intent, completely locking Lionel in place.</span></p></div>
