        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana reminded, "You just need to drop the first drop of blood on the Star Token, and it will bind to your aura. If you encounter danger, just tap the Star Token three times, and I will sense it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you're not extremely far from me or in a completely sealed space, I can teleport to you instantly through the Star Token to protect you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished speaking, Osborne eagerly cut his finger and dropped blood onto the Star Token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, the Star Token emitted a dazzling light, enveloping Osborne entirely. Its power gradually synchronized with Osborne's aura, and then the light slowly dimmed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne fiddled with the Star Token in his hand, pondering, "Although the Star Token has no direct offensive ability, it can passively trigger a defense mechanism in deadly crises, teleporting me to a safe place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although it offers limited help in enhancing my strength, it provides me with an extra layer of security."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I hang it on the Warfare Ancient Tree, could it further enhance its power? If it evolves into an Imperial Artifact in the future, its might would surely become even greater."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought flashed by, and the Star Token in Osborne's hand instantly vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, it appeared in his Soul Current Ocean, hanging on the trunk of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's expression suddenly changed, and she curiously asked, "Why has the aura of the Star Token on you disappeared? How did you do it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned upon hearing this and said, "You can sense the aura of the Star Token?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana nodded and replied, "I mentioned before that the five Star Tokens are interconnected and can be used for mutual assistance. One serves as the main, while the other four are secondary, and I hold the main Star Token. In theory, I can sense the location, aura, and status of the other four secondary Star Tokens."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if you don't actively seek my help, as long as the Star Token's defense mechanism is triggered, I can still sense it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, the moment you put away the Star Token, I could no longer sense its aura, as if the connection had been severed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne simply smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "So the Star Token actually has a primary and secondary distinction. Ms. Alba can actively sense the status of the other four secondary Star Tokens through the primary Star Token."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the Warfare Ancient Tree possesses the ability to suppress all Sacred Artifacts. Once the Star Token is hung on it, all its aura will be completely concealed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, with the presence of the Warfare Ancient Tree, my Star Token will gradually strengthen, possibly even surpassing Ms. Alba's primary Star Token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the future, which one will be the true primary Star Token remains uncertain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne naturally wouldn&rsquo;t tell Adriana that this was the effect of the Warfare Ancient Tree, not because he didn&rsquo;t trust her, but because it wasn&rsquo;t necessary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone has their own secrets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana only asked out of sheer surprise. Seeing that Osborne had no intention of explaining, she smoothly changed the subject, "Anyway, from now on, you are the honorary patriarch of the Fairy Moon Sect. However, keep your identity confidential for now. This time heading to Necropolis City, the Fairy Moon Sect has two spots. I will bring another deputy patriarch along with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and curiously asked, "Ms. Alba, how much do you know about Necropolis City?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana shook her head and replied, "Not at all! I only know it's a very mysterious place, and only the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom knows how to get there."</span></p></div>
