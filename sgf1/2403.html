        <h1>Chapter 2318 Debate-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The clash between Jared and Leroy was still Leroy's responsibility! And as for Jared provoking a strong opponent? Osborne hails from your Tempest Fortress City. Given his power, why didn't you warn us sooner?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This all stems from your failure to provide reliable intel, and that's what led to this mess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maisie let out a disbelieving scoff. "Me being unreasonable? You guys from Radiant Enigmas Academy were the ones who proposed this alliance of the Eight Great Academies! And who did you pick as the team leader? One of your own! In the end, if Jared makes it into the top ten, all the glory goes straight to Radiant Enigmas Academy, while Azure Haven Academy gets zilch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So now I'm the bad guy for causing a stir? Fine, if that's the way it is, let's just scrap the alliance! You can go it alone, Radiant Enigmas Academy. We at Azure Haven Academy are out of this mess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked like Maisie and Ezra were about to have a full-blown showdown. The other six vice presidents could see things were going south fast, so they quickly stepped in to play peacemaker, trying to soothe the ruffled feathers of the two angry academicians.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them pleaded, "Hey, folks, let's take a chill pill! The state duel ain't over yet. Arguing and finger-pointing right now won't do us any good! We still have a shot. The Eight Great Academies have been in this together for ages. We shouldn't let a minor squabble tear us apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're spot on! Let's not lose heart..." another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to their words, both Ezra and Maisie started to simmer down, but they still huffed at each other and avoided making eye contact. Clearly, their beef wasn't going to be settled so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other vice presidents exchanged worried looks and let out a collective sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's such a shame. This state duel was our best shot at cracking the top ten. Now, with Jared injured and losing one-tenth of our points, our chances of breaking into the top ten are nearly gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the vice presidents turned their attention back to the projection, only to be left utterly flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes widened in disbelief, and they sprang to their feet, brimming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can this be?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the first layer of Arctic Maw Chasm, Osborne had just taken down Jared's squad. With a cold smirk, he seized Jared's emblem and stuck it next to his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, his score skyrocketed by an astounding 320 thousand points, while Jared's plummeted from 3.2 million to 2.88 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse yet, his ranking tumbled from tenth to twelfth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just flashed an icy, victorious smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Leroy and Clara walked over. They glanced at Jared's dropping ranking, and Leroy couldn't help but let out a soft sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she used to be on that team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alliance of the Eight Great Academies had set their sights on a top-ten finish, but now it felt like she'd single-handedly torpedoed their chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy, even though she didn't regret his choices, felt a twinge of unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a disciple of Azure Haven Academy and a member of the Eight-Great-Academies alliance, she'd wanted them to snag a top-ten spot just as much as anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no way Leroy could get in Osborne's way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Osborne defeated Jared, he was eligible to receive one-tenth of Jared's points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy asked, "What's our next play?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's only half a day left in the state duel. Osborne, do you still think you can crack the top ten? If you're going for it, we're more than happy to lend a hand! Each of us can transfer 800 thousand points. We can give you a tenth of what we've got.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If everything goes according to plan, you could rack up around 800 thousand points! Sure, we're a long shot from the three million of the top-ten teams, but if we get lucky and manage to take out a few high-ranked squads, you've still got a fighting chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara bobbed her head up and down eagerly. "You bet! Osborne, we're dead-set on helping you make it into the top ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing their words of encouragement, Osborne gave a serene smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shoot for the top ten? Absolutely! But here's the thing, I'm not stopping there! We're all going to make it into the top ten together! Alright, let's start doling out those points!"</span></p></div>
