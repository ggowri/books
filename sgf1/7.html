        <h1>Chapter 7 The Real Ace Up His Sleeve</h1>
        <div><p>&quot;Hold it! I&#x27;ll let her go!&quot;</p><p>Just as Ophelia finished counting down and was about to order the shooting, Osborne took a deep breath and pushed Evelyn away.</p><p>He stared at Ophelia with a crazy look in his eyes. &quot;Ophelia, tell your men to get out of the hospital right now. Otherwise, if a single hair on my sister&#x27;s head is harmed, I&#x27;ll make sure all of you pay with your lives!&quot;</p><p>Ophelia scoffed disdainfully at his words.</p><p>Seeing that Evelyn was free again, she sneered coldly, &quot;Loser, you&#x27;re in no position to bargain with me now. You&#x27;re nothing but a sitting duck!&quot;</p><p>With that, she waved her hand confidently. &quot;Go up there and capture him alive! If he resists, you&#x27;re allowed to shoot!&quot;</p><p>A dozen bodyguards moved at her command. Grinning and sneering, they rushed up the stairs with their guns in hand and soon reached Osborne.</p><p>But at that moment, Osborne laughed.</p><p>Ophelia snapped, &quot;What are you laughing at, loser?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m laughing at you for celebrating too soon!&quot;</p><p>With that, in full view of everyone, Osborne abruptly flung open his coat.</p><p>&quot;Ophelia, open your damn eyes and see what this is! If you&#x27;ve got the guts, order them to shoot! Come on!&quot;</p><p>Hearing Osborne&#x27;s roar, Ophelia remained calm at first, scoffing, &quot;Loser, I told you, no matter what tricks you have up your sleeve, today you&#x27;re...&quot;</p><p>Suddenly, she stopped speaking. Her eyes widened in horror as she looked at Osborne&#x27;s body.</p><p>Her eyes widened in horror as she looked at Osborne&#x27;s body.</p><p>Not just her, everyone was in shock.</p><p>They stepped back in terror, as if they&#x27;d seen something truly terrifying.</p><p>Under his coat, Osborne was covered in rows of homemade explosives.</p><p>And in his right hand, he held a remote control, his finger already on the red button.</p><p>&quot;Damn it!&quot; Ophelia gasped, feeling a chill run down her spine.</p><p>Osborne saw her fear and sneered, &quot;Ophelia, the high-grade explosives on me can turn my body into mincemeat and reduce this entire villa to rubble. None of you will make it out alive.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m just an ordinary civilian. It&#x27;s worth it to have you noble aristocrats accompany me to hell!&quot;</p><p>Osborne&#x27;s cold words made everyone gasp.</p><p>Ophelia shrieked, &quot;Osborne, you&#x27;re crazy! Where did you get so many high-grade explosives?&quot;</p><p>In Rosmandi, guns were everywhere.</p><p>It was easy to get a pistol if one had money.</p><p>Even automatic rifles, though more strictly controlled, weren&#x27;t a problem for the aristocratic families.</p><p>However, high-grade explosives were under extremely strict control.</p><p>Even a powerful family like the Caldwells had a hard time getting their hands on them.</p><p>So, Ophelia never imagined that Osborne would come to the Caldwell Estate strapped with explosives.</p><p>Osborne said coldly, &quot;Ophelia, I told you, I didn&#x27;t plan on leaving here alive when I came today. If I don&#x27;t get the divorce compensation, we&#x27;ll all go down together.&quot;</p><p>After saying that, Osborne suddenly took a few steps forward.</p><p>He walked up to a bodyguard who was still holding a gun. The guard didn&#x27;t dare to shoot. As Osborne approached, cold sweat dripped down his face, and his hand holding the gun began to tremble.</p><p>Osborne sneered and snatched the gun from him.</p><p>The guard didn&#x27;t dare to resist, afraid that any sudden move would make Osborne accidentally detonate the explosives.</p><p>At such a close distance, if the explosives went off, he wouldn&#x27;t even have a body left.</p><p>He could only watch as Osborne took the gun and then smashed the butt of it hard against his eyebrow.</p><p>The guard let out a scream and fell to the ground, blood gushing from his head.</p><p>Osborne looked down at him and said coldly, &quot;A few hours ago at the Caldwell Tower, it was you who smashed my head with the gun butt, right?</p><p>&quot;How does it feel to be on the receiving end now?&quot;</p><p>After saying that, Osborne suddenly stomped hard on the bodyguard&#x27;s face, crushing his nose bridge and knocking him unconscious.</p><p>Then, he turned to look at the other bodyguards around.</p><p>These were Ophelia&#x27;s bodyguards who had all laid hands on him earlier. They&#x27;d beaten his body and trampled on his dignity.</p><p>Now, there was nothing but terror in their eyes.</p><p>Without hesitation, Osborne brought the butt of the gun down on another bodyguard, knocking him to the ground, and then started punching and kicking.</p><p>And then the third.</p><p>The fourth.</p><p>The fifth.</p><p>In no time, the dozen or so bodyguards who had ganged up on Osborne a few hours ago were lying on the ground, their heads bloodied and faces covered in gore.</p><p>Ophelia could only watch helplessly.</p><p>As she stared at the crazy Osborne, a chill ran down her spine. It was as if she was seeing him for the very first time.</p><p>Was this really the good-for-nothing Osborne she used to know?</p><p>Today, he was a whole new person. He was wild, mighty, and dauntless!</p><p>&quot;Enough!&quot; Ophelia finally summoned the courage to push aside her fear and roared at the top of her voice.</p><p>&quot;Osborne, I know you. You wouldn&#x27;t go down with us. You&#x27;ve had your revenge. Call it off!&quot;</p><p>Osborne wiped the blood off his pistol and said nonchalantly, &quot;Are you really sure you know me?&quot;</p></div>
