        <h1>Chapter 295 Four Pieces of Jewelry</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After three days of relentless searching, Osborne emerged from the mines with 36 blood diamonds in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first glance, 36 didn't seem like a whole lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, a century ago, the Sinclair family had unearthed over 100 blood diamonds from the same mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to that, Osborne's haul was just a third of their impressive cache. But he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These thirty-six blood diamonds represented a staggering wealth, enough to build a substantial power base if used wisely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he played his cards right, they could catapult him into the ranks of a Class A master in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "My Satan's Eye can see through the soil and rock up to 32 feet deep. But I still can't find any more blood diamonds. Even if there are some hidden in </span><span>the mine, I doubt there's much left.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, there's something about this diamond mine that doesn't sit right with me. It's as if there's a deeper, powerful energy down there. Otherwise, how can you explain the existence of blood diamonds?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he knew he wasn't equipped to explore further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The longer Osborne stayed in the mine, the more uneasy he felt. Over the past three days, he had experienced odd sensations, as if something was trying to warp his judgment, leading him to become irritable and impulsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to his Satan's Eye, a refreshing wave of clarity would wash over Osborne, grounding him each time he felt overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, "What in the world is this energy?</span><span> </span><span>Never mind! Fortunately, that strange energy doesn't seem to affect ordinary miners.</span><span> </span><span>It only impacts martial artists and metahumans, so diamond extraction should be fine.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, I'll leave the management of this diamond mine to Alison. The high-quality diamonds produced here will propel Luna Jewelry to new heights, helping us expand nationally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having gathered what he came for, it was time to prepare for the next phase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Osborne returned to the headquarters of Luna Jewelry, where he found Alison waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked </span><span>exhausted,</span><span> her eyes heavy with fatigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past three days, she had been burning the midnight oil, tirelessly working to complete the four exquisite pieces of jewelry Osborne had requested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alison had finished</span><span> the task</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying a word, she retrieved four beautifully crafted boxes and presented them to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She announced, forcing a smile despite her weariness, "Mr. Augustine, the jewelry you asked for is right here.</span><span> </span><span>I used up just about every ounce of inspiration I had in me. I hope you like them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank a little at the sight of her weariness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've really outdone yourself, Alison. I can't thank you enough. Your hard work won't go unnoticed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he opened the first box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside it lay an incredibly elegant crown, reminiscent of the Crown of Fate but with a distinctive flair all its own. The design was sleek and minimalist</span><span> with </span><span>just a stunning pear-shaped diamond as the centerpiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had a way of capturing attention instantly, striking a perfect balance of simplicity and grandeur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was smitten</span><span> by it</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, how about we give it a name?" Alison suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's call it the 'Divine Favor Crown'."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Favor Crown?" Alison echoed softly, knowing it was destined for someone special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of envy washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "If only it were for me.</span><span> </span><span>But I'm just an employee; there's no way </span><span>someone like Osborne would gift something so valuable to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne opened the second wooden box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was long and elegant, nearly three feet in length. Inside, he found a beautifully crafted sword sheath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheath was unassuming yet striking in its simplicity, showcasing the brilliance of the perfect diamond nestled within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exclaimed, a satisfied grin spreading across his face, "Perfect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's going to love this. No matter how tough she is, at the end of the day, she's still a woman. I can't believe a gift like this won't win her over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled softly to himself, then reached for the third box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third and fourth boxes were identical, each about twenty inches long, designed to hold a scepter - a scepter meant for a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne opened both boxes, two magnificent scepters emerged, each stunning in its own right but with completely different styles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was a soft pink, while the other shimmered in a deep blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their designs seemed to draw inspiration from the scepter of Queen in Yalynch, </span><span>but they were </span><span>only more refined, capturing Osborne's admiration instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, his eyes sparkling with approval, "Wow, these are incredible!</span><span> </span><span>You've really outdone yourself, Alison. If these pieces ever see the light of day, you'll be the hottest designer on the planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, I'm just glad you're pleased," Alison replied with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had poured all her creativity into these four pieces, and now she felt utterly drained. The thought of designing jewelry again anytime soon was daunting; she just wanted to clear her mind for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Alison couldn't help but feel a deep affection for the pieces she had created.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she also knew that these treasures were not meant for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison's gaze lingered on the exquisite scepters, a bittersweet yearning in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne picked up the box containing the blue scepter and handed it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This one's for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison froze, her eyes wide with disbelief. "Wait, what? For me?"</span></p></div>
