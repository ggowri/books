        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending a few days on Necoton Planet, Osborne finally stepped onto the Cosmic Translocator bound for Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their destination? The Glorious Divine Kingdom, one of the three Top-tier Powers on Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three dominant forces&mdash;Glorious Divine Kingdom, Evernight Court, and Phantom Commerce Guild&mdash;controlled more than half of Racial Convergence Planet's territory combined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the Phantom Commerce Guild had a relatively small domain, while the Evernight Court claimed about 30% of the planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Glorious Divine Kingdom, slightly weaker, occupied around 20%.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what did that 20% even look like?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne struggled to find the right words to describe it. The Glorious Divine Kingdom was divided into ten zones, each containing a hundred states, and each state had a hundred cities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the size of each city?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no smaller than the entire Celestara Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to estimate, the territory of the Glorious Divine Kingdom was roughly equivalent to a staggering one hundred thousand Celestara Planets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, the Glorious Divine Kingdom was vast&mdash;so vast that even a regular Supernal Deity King would take years to fly from the southern tip to the northern edge of the empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, every city within the kingdom had its own Cosmic Translocator, allowing anyone with enough Celestial Crystals to travel freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, countless factions, both large and small, existed within the territory of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mystic Sirius Sect was one of these Second-rate powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overall, the forces on Racial Convergence Planet could be categorized into five tiers&mdash;Top-tier Power, First-rate Power, Second-rate Power, Third-rate Power, and Piddling Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top three powers were the Evernight Court, Glorious Divine Kingdom, and Phantom Commerce Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These three held supreme status, and no other factions dared to challenge them or offend them; they could only exist under the trio's shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were dozens of First-rate Powers on Racial Convergence Planet&mdash;at most, a hundred&mdash;each one incredibly strong, boasting numerous Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, there were many more Second-rate Powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mystic Sirius Sect, for instance, had elders, leaders, and elite disciples who were all Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were practically countless Third-rate Powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a faction to be considered a Third-rate Power, it had to have at least one Empyrean Sacredness warrior. Without one, they didn't even make the cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Glorious Divine Kingdom, there were more than twenty First-rate Powers and hundreds of Second-rate Powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of these factions had to pay resources to the Glorious Divine Kingdom every year, and in return, they got a certain level of protection from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Sirius Sect was in Eastern Zone 3 of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, close to Tempest Fortress City, which was one of the three Second-rate Powers in that area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a disorienting trip through the transporter, Osborne, along with Isa and Maddox, finally landed in the territory of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they materialized on the huge Cosmic Translocator, they saw a bunch of people popping up around them, all wearing excited expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Racial Convergence Planet! I'm finally here!" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! Is this really Racial Convergence Planet? The energy here is amazing! The gravitational pull is so strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at all these warriors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could sense the awe in their voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew these people had come from numerous medium-sized, small, and even tiny life planets in the vicinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them was a top-notch talent on their own planets. However, once they reached a certain cultivation level, their home planets no longer had the resources to support their further advancement. To break through to higher cultivation levels, they had no choice but to come to the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p></div>
