  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s exclamation caught Ophelia&rsquo;s attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia looked over and asked quickly, &ldquo;Wesley, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next second, she noticed the name of the painting, which was in Osborne&rsquo;s hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How could this be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How could Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s painting be the one you bid? It&rsquo;s impossible! This painting is ordinary. How could it be Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s work?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s words attracted a lot of people&rsquo;s attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They looked in the direction of Osborne. When they learned that the mysterious lot Clarissa provided was actually the painting that Osborne had just bid for ten million dollars, they were all dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, their eyes were filled with envy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not long ago, they thought Osborne was a fool for spending ten million dollars to buy a painting that looked crappy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, they envied him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If they had known that this painting was Clarissa&rsquo;s, let alone 10 million dollars, even if it was 20 million dollars or 30 million dollars, they would have bought it at any price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, as long as they had lunch with Clarissa, they would have a chance to make connections with the Radcliffe family. Then, they could make ten or even a hundred times the money they had spent before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They experienced a mixture of envy, regret, and sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone present wished that they could replace Osborne or buy the paintings in his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Impossible! It&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia were the two people who completely couldn&rsquo;t accept the fact. They dreamed of making a connection with Clarissa, but in the end, they had no chance at all. However, Osborne, whom they looked down upon, got the chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They envied Osborne so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled, &ldquo;Mr. Ashford, why do you think it is impossible? Do you think this painting is ugly? You think it is impossible that Ms. Radcliffe painted it, right?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; Wesley wanted to say that the painting was ugly and didn&rsquo;t look like Clarissa&rsquo;s work. But he suddenly realized that he could not say that, so he bit back his words and glared at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne is setting me up</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, </span>Wesley thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">If I said in front of Clarissa that the painting was ugly, how would Clarissa look at me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even if she didn&rsquo;t get angry on the spot, I would probably suffer the consequences in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Fortunately, I didn&rsquo;t fall into the trap.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley said, &ldquo;Humph! I didn&rsquo;t say that. I bid six million dollars to buy this painting. I knew it was extraordinary. It was indeed Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If Ophelia hadn&rsquo;t stopped me, I would have definitely bid higher than ten million dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying this, he secretly glanced at Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Clarissa didn&rsquo;t even look back as if she did not care who had bought her painting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley then stared at the painting in Osborne&rsquo;s hand with burning eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Desire and greed flickered in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled and said calmly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at it. This painting is mine. You have given in just now. Remember, men can never give in.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Fuck you!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was furious, feeling very regretful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He still stared at the painting, wishing he could snatch it away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne suddenly said in a low voice, &ldquo;Mr. Ashford, you seem to want this painting very much. Give up. But if you want the opportunity to have lunch with Ms. Radcliffe, I can sell it to you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What? You are willing to sell the quota. Really?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley exclaimed and looked at Osborne in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shrugged. &ldquo;Of course. Ms. Lewis said that I can bring two friends to have lunch with Ms. Radcliffe. But I don&rsquo;t have many friends, so I might as well sell the quotas.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s breathing became short when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He whispered, &ldquo;Osborne, sell the quotas to me. How much do you want? Just name your price.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled. Wesley really took the bait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He held up four fingers and said calmly, &ldquo;Forty million dollars for two quotas. You and Ophelia exactly give me twenty million dollars each.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What? 40 million dollars? Are you fucking crazy?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley exclaimed and glared at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He growled, &ldquo;Osborne, you bought the painting for ten million dollars, but you want to sell the two quotas for 40 million dollars. Are you crazy?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia also glared at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne ignored their angry eyes and said calmly, &ldquo;Yes. Buy it or not, it&rsquo;s up to you. If you don&rsquo;t want it, I will sell it to someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I think other big shots are willing to buy the two quotas. Even if no one bought them for 40 million dollars, I could sell them for 20 million dollars. Someone will buy them.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon hearing this, Wesley and Ophelia frowned and looked at each other quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia said, &ldquo;Osborne, what do you mean? You sell them to others for 20 million dollars, but you want to sell them to us for 40 million dollars. Humph, we can buy them with 20 million dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked at them in disdain. &ldquo;Sorry, I don&rsquo;t like you. I would feel sick if I sold the quotas to you, so I naturally have to sell them to you at a higher price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t change my mind. 40 million dollars for two quotas. It&rsquo;s up to you whether you buy them or not. If not, get out of here, and don&rsquo;t disturb me from selling them.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing Osborne&rsquo;s disdainful words, Wesley and Ophelia were pissed off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You are going on the scamp!&rdquo; Wesley was in a rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia said with a frown, &ldquo;Osborne, you know how important this opportunity is to me! You have already extorted 20 million dollars from my family. Give me the quotas, and I won&rsquo;t bother with you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne said coldly, &ldquo;I extorted your family? That&rsquo;s what I deserve. You want to get the quotas for free, huh? No way. Since you don&rsquo;t want to buy the quotas, I will sell them to others.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Osborne stood up.</p><div class="pagination">
