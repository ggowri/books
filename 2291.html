  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To get into the second layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm, one didn't just go deeper through those underground fissures. Nah, one had to use a Translocator. Plop a Celestial Crystal on that Translocator, and bam! It fired up and zapped an individual straight to the second layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they landed, everyone felt a shockwave go through them. The wind was howling in their ears like a pack of wild wolves, kicking up a blizzard of snowflakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't feel like they were deep underground at all. It was more like they'd been dropped into an ice-cold wasteland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more people started to tap into their divine power to fend off that bone-chilling wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they made it to the third layer. The cold wind here was like a monster on steroids. At least half of the thousand state duel participants were already using their divine power to defend themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't, those howling gales would turn them into human ice sculptures in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert declared, "The first three layers are a piece of cake! The environment here isn't that tough. You guys, being the top dogs of Zephyr State, have got what it takes to hang around here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the fourth layer? That's a whole different ballgame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, next up, we're heading into the fourth layer. But let me tell you, most of you won't be able to hack it. I know you're probably thinking I'm full of it. So, if you wanna see for yourselves, just step into the Translocator."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished talking, a bunch of folks didn't waste any time and hopped into the Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a bit of hemming and hawing, the rest of them decided to follow suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all believed in seeing was believing. They were itching to see with their own two eyes if the fourth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm was really as harsh and uninhabitable as Rupert made it out to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone murmured, "Searching for tokens in the fourth layer would be a game-changer! I mean, each token there is worth a thousand points! Finding one token in the fourth layer is like finding a thousand in the first layer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, there might be fewer tokens in the fourth layer, but there'll also be fewer competitors. You could definitely rack up points way faster in the early goings and leave the others in the dust!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm dying to see if the environment in the fourth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm is really that lousy! As long as I can tough it out, I'm staying put in the fourth layer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, nearly everyone piled into the Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Rupert flashed a mischievous smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really sure you wanna go down there? I already gave you the heads-up that most of you ain't got what it takes to survive in the fourth layer. It's a struggle just to stay alive, let alone look for tokens! But since you don't buy it, go ahead and see for yourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Rupert fired up the Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the group vanished from the third layer. When they came to their senses, they were in the fourth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, a terrifying sight unfolded before their eyes. In this fourth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm, the frigid wind was howling like a banshee. It lashed at their bodies like a barrage of knives, leaving streaks of blood on their skin in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the blood could even trickle out, it froze solid in an instant. Then, new bloody marks appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ice crystals formed on their bodies at breakneck speed, freezing their flesh and blood. Many people let out ear-splitting screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some quick-witted ones immediately conjured up divine power defenses. But in the howling gale of cold, their divine power defenses were no match. They started to freeze and crack bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can there be such a god-awful cold wind? It's like a barrage of ice knives! My divine power defense can't even hold up against it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Sacred Power defense can hold for now, but the energy consumption is through the roof! It's draining faster than I can say 'Jack Robinson'. I won't last long here. Once my Sacred Power runs out and the defense crumbles, I'll be frozen solid and won't be able to get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! How could it be this terrifying?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this is just the fourth layer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm ranked 260th on the power rankings, but I feel like I can barely last an hour or two in the fourth layer before I gotta bail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can only hang on for half an hour!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was chatting a mile a minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who could still spare the energy to talk were considered to have some decent chops. Most of them were pouring all their power into resisting the bone-chilling gales of the fourth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those ranked in the top hundred were relatively at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, folks like Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson, who were in the top twenty, didn't even bother with any defenses. They were just relying on their own brute physical strength to tough out the terrifying cold winds of the fourth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disparity in strength was as clear as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert had said earlier that only one or two hundred people would be able to search for tokens in the fourth layer. The rest would only be able to stay there for a short while before getting frozen solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now it looked like he wasn't pulling anyone's leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, even Clara had summoned her Sacred Power for defense and was frowning like there was no tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't bat an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His physical body was so tough that the cold winds might as well have been a gentle breeze. There was no way they could freeze or hurt him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, since only those ranked around the top twenty weren't using any defenses, Osborne didn't want to stick out like a sore thumb. So, Osborne also put up a defense, pretending that his body couldn't take the cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Clara and asked, "How are you holding up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara looked serious and shook her head. "Not good! The cold winds in the fourth layer are a real beast. I gotta use my Sacred Power to fend them off, and it's getting drained every second. At this rate, I'm gonna run out of juice in a few hours! Then I'll have to hightail it out of the fourth layer and head back to the third."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne frowned a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a real pain in the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara looked at Osborne and asked, "What about you? How're you feeling? This kind of cold wind should be a piece of cake for you, and your Sacred Power shouldn't be draining fast, right? You should be able to stay in the fourth layer all day, shouldn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a nod. "I'm doing just fine here! Staying in the fourth layer for as long as it takes is no biggie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Clara felt a twinge of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry about this! I'm cramping your style. When the state duel kicks off for real, you should stay in the fourth layer and hunt for tokens. Once my Sacred Power is all topped up, I'll head up here to search too. When the power drain gets too much, I'll head back down to the third layer, looking for tokens and recharging my Sacred Power at the same time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a smile. "Hey, we're a team! There's no such thing as one person slowing the other down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Rupert's power washed over everyone there, and the biting force of the cold wind was instantly gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grinned and said, "So, how'd you guys like the fourth layer? Now, if you feel like you can't handle it, you'd better hightail it back to the third layer right away! And if you're up for the challenge of the fifth layer, you can stick around!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he'd finished speaking, a bunch of folks in the crowd decided to beat a retreat from the fourth layer and head back to the third, taking a good look at their own abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if they couldn't even stand up to the cold wind of the fourth layer, there was no point in going to the fifth layer. It'd only end up with them looking like a bunch of losers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, only around three hundred people stuck around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was one of them. Even though she knew it'd be an uphill battle for her to make it in the fifth layer, she was still itching to give it a shot and see how the others were holding up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to find out just how big the gap was between her and them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert declared, "Alright then! Let's head on up to the fifth layer right now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
