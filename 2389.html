  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne listened to the discussions around him and couldn't help but sneer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't believe these people would truly see him as a public enemy or go all out against him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone here is a genius from the various states of Eastern Zone 3, not fools, so they wouldn't act so impulsively. Even if Valentino came to trouble him, he was probably just trying to show off his special status.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If someone really wanted him to deliberately cause trouble for Osborne, he definitely wouldn't do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, this is a treasure hunt. Everyone needs to seize every moment to search for resources and treasures, leaving no time to target others&mdash;unless they completely don't care about achieving any results.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, no matter what, Osborne is the champion of Zephyr State. Even though almost everyone thinks it's impossible for him to win, they must admit that Osborne's strength is absolutely among the top, if not the best, in their group.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, in the top ten betting pools set by Phantom Commerce Guild, Osborne's odds rank within the top twenty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among those present, few are confident in dealing with Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they are filled with righteous indignation, eager to label Osborne as their common enemy, probably just hoping others will target Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That way, they would have one less competitor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for themselves, unless they happen to encounter him, they definitely won't deliberately seek out Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne didn't really care about becoming the common enemy of all the contestants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the saying goes, in the face of absolute strength, all targeting is meaningless. Actually, the Phantom Commerce Guild's casino has a saying that's quite true...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne indeed didn't take these people present seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His goal is to dominate everyone effortlessly with absolute strength and win the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Silence!" A stern shout suddenly rang out, followed by a blurred figure appearing before everyone. He sat on a grand and towering throne, floating in mid-air, looking down on the crowd from above.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am the chief referee for this zone duel. My name is Gerald. Now, I will take you to the Cosmic Translocator. In one hour, the zone duel will officially begin."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Gerald waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A force enveloped the thousand contestants present. Everyone felt a blur in their vision and had already left Crescentia, arriving in its outskirts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, an enormous Cosmic Translocator appeared before them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such a massive Cosmic Translocator?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was extremely astonished and thought, "It seems the zone </span><span>duel</span><span> battlefield is indeed not on the Racial Convergence Planet but on a planet incredibly far away from it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne looked at Gerald again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald gave off an incredibly intimidating vibe. When Osborne looked at him, it felt like staring at a blazing sun, almost impossible to face directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "He must have reached the level of an Empyrean Sacredness supreme warrior, but I wonder if it's Lesser Perfection or Great Perfection."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked into the distance again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, near the Cosmic Translocator, there was a viewing platform. Below it, countless spectators were gathered densely, likely numbering in the billions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the viewing platform, there were quite a few people as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every spectator was incredibly powerful; only those who had at least reached Empyrean Sacredness could step onto the viewing platform.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly glanced around but didn&rsquo;t spot Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Ms. Olsen said Ms. Alba would personally come to watch, but I haven't seen her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had originally wanted to ask Adriana about Isa, Clarissa, and Anastasia, as it had been almost half a year since they last met, and Osborne missed them a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Maybe Adriana will show up after the zone duel begins!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stopped thinking about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Gerald again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Gerald was still suspended in mid-air. That enormous, ornate throne was clearly an extremely powerful Sacred Artifact. He sat there quietly, seemingly waiting for something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, someone quickly appeared beside him and whispered a few words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald nodded and then looked at Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Everyone listen up, now I will announce the rules of the zone duel! First, the battlefield for the zone duel of Eastern Zone 3 will be set on a small resource planet far away from the Racial Convergence Planet, Abyssal Planet. Abyssal Planet was discovered not long ago, and just two days ago, the Cosmic Translocator was completed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, prior to this, we only conducted basic preliminary exploration on Abyssal Planet, and no one has ventured deep into it yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have ten days to explore Abyssal Planet and collect as many rare resources and treasures as possible from it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, each of you will receive a list!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"According to the guidance on the list, the more resources or treasures you ultimately obtain, the higher your ranking will be. However, I must warn you, the environment on this small resource planet is extremely harsh, and there are many powerful native creatures. It will be very dangerous, so you'd better know your limits!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Gerald waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, all the contestants found a list in their hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly glanced at it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ethereal Bloom, a specialty of Abyssal Planet, is a transparent flower growing in the northern extreme cold regions, with flowing light on its petals. One Ethereal Bloom can be exchanged for a thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bloody Ivy, a specialty of Abyssal Planet, is a blood-red vine growing in the western desert region, hidden in the desert and capable of draining life force. One Bloody Ivy can be exchanged for five thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Abyssal Bone, the remains of native warriors from Abyssal Planet, can be found across the entire planet and is used as a crafting material. One early-stage Empyrean Sacredness Abyssal Bone can be exchanged for thirty thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. A mid-stage Empyrean Sacredness Abyssal Bone can be exchanged for three hundred thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, late-stage Empyrean Sacredness...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dark Mandala, a specialty of Abyssal Planet, is a flower growing deep within the eastern volcanoes, burning with purple-black flames and covered in starry patterns on its petals, highly poisonous. One Dark Mandala can be exchanged for one million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Abyssal Snake Slough, a specialty of Abyssal Planet, appears across the entire planet. It is the shed skin of a serpent-like creature, patterned like a galaxy and filled with Sacred Power. It can be exchanged for fifty thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly glanced through the list of resources and treasures and couldn't help but feel surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These were all things he had never heard of.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These things turned out to be specialties of Abyssal Planet, never found anywhere else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, if someone wanted to prepare these things in advance to cheat, it would be almost impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the value of these items varies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Low-value items can only be exchanged for a few thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The highest value item should be the Dark Mandala. A single Dark Mandala can be exchanged for one million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. Osborne, from the Sect Tournament to the city duel in Tempest Fortress City, and the state duel in Zephyr State, winning all the way to now, has only earned one million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> in total.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, just by finding a single Dark Mandala on Abyssal Planet, you can exchange it for one million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, equivalent to the value of one million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, with such high value, finding a Dark Mandala won't be easy; they must be incredibly rare. Moreover, places with Dark Mandalas will definitely be extremely dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether to search for high-value but rare and extremely dangerous treasures, or to look for lower-value but more abundant and less dangerous resources or treasures, depends on his own choice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, after the ten-day zone duel, whoever exchanges the most Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> will be the champion.</span></p><div class="pagination">
