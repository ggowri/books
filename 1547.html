  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah snapped back to reality at Osborne's question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if we're talking about big news, there's definitely something! And it's all connected to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned slightly, and Osborne leaned in, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? What's this big news that involves me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The biggest thing is about the Wild Flame Army! Recently, the Ninth Dark Deity Legion gathered a force of 400 thousand elite warriors from the Wild Flame Army, Inferno Army, </span><span>Thunderwind</span><span> Army, and Firestorm Army to launch an offensive against Divine Peak Nine. They just got the results, and it's not good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ninth Dark Deity Legion failed their mission!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reports say there were massive casualties&mdash;only about 200 thousand of the 400 thousand returned. That's nearly half!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Wild Flame Army alone lost over 40 thousand elite warriors! This is the worst loss they've faced in decades!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I heard that the Ninth Dark Deity Legion isn't giving up; they're planning to regroup and launch another attack on Divine Peak Nine. They've issued a call for reinforcements from all four armies to send more elite warriors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's expression turned serious as she glanced at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard that the Wild Flame Army is already preparing to select over 40 thousand elite warriors to head back to Divine Peak Nine for support. I'm worried you might get picked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock. "The Ninth Dark Deity Legion failed? Nearly 200 thousand elite warriors dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And they're still pushing forward? What on earth did they encounter at Divine Peak Nine? Did they run into a Deity King level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah shook her head. "I don't know! Information about Divine Peak Nine is classified, and it rarely leaks out. All I know is that it was a major defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that a Deity King level deputy commander was killed in this fight, along with dozens of Deity Overlord level warriors. The casualties among Celestial Deity level warriors were even higher."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah bit her lip, concern etched on her face. "With your strength and your status in the Human Community, I really think the Wild Flame Army will recruit you for this mission to Divine Peak Nine. They might even assign you to the most dangerous tasks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If even a Deity King level deputy commander was killed, and so many Deity Overlords died, I... I'm scared for your safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, but his expression quickly shifted to one of determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is so close to a full recovery. Ordinary high-grade death scent won't cut it anymore; only death scent liquid can do the trick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that's only obtainable by taking down a Deity King-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, which can only be found at the divine peak itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been racking my brain about how to get to Divine Peak Nine and secure that death scent liquid. But now, the opportunity has presented itself! Even if the Wild Flame Army doesn't recruit me, I'll volunteer myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have to make sure the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is fully restored! This isn't just about me gaining a complete immortal body; it's about my grandfather, my sister, and the others! If the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity doesn't fully recover, they won't be able to leave the Dimensional Microcosm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how dangerous it is to go to Divine Peak Nine, I have to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a moment to gather his thoughts, Osborne said firmly, "I'm part of the Wild Flame Army, and if they assign me to support Divine Peak Nine, I'll have to go! You know the consequences of defying military orders. But don't worry. I know how to take care of myself. Honestly, I've been curious about Divine Peak Nine, and I've wanted to see it for myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his reassurance, Hannah remained concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Divine Peak Nine is incredibly dangerous! They sent 400 thousand elite warriors from the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, and almost 200 thousand of them died! Even Deity King-level warriors fell in battle. Your strength is impressive, but in a conflict of that scale, an individual's power can seem insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if you applied for retirement right now? I can use my connections with the Gellar family to help you! If you wait until you're selected to go, it might be too late!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Hannah, touched by her worry for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had his own ambitions&mdash;he had set his sights on rising within the ranks of the Wild Flame Army. The idea of retiring wasn't on his agenda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I appreciate your concern, Hannah, but I can't apply for retirement. My goal is to rise quickly within the Wild Flame Army. I need to become part of the higher-ups to protect more of the Human Community and make a real change in the situation for the Human Community in Wild Flame City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his resolute stance, Hannah let out a sigh, deciding not to press the issue any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly shifted gears to lighten the mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mentioned there were several significant events, all tied to me. What else is happening besides this?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
