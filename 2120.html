  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them, a dozen Mud Golems were in hot pursuit. Ahead, another dozen emerged, and in an instant, they activated the crystals on their chests, bursting out with a dazzling blue light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck and the others, enveloped by the blue light, immediately felt a deafening roar in their minds. It was as if their souls were being ripped out of their bodies, and they could no longer control themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies froze in place, and they could only watch helplessly as the Mud Golems rapidly approached, raising their huge fists high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If those fists came crashing down, among these people, except for Chuck of Ascension Six, no one else could withstand the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would all be killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, there was nothing they could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fastest Mud Golem had reached them, and its massive fist came crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the combined number of the two exploration teams led by Prince Chuck and Princess Joanna had dwindled to just over fifty. Most of them were elite guards of the Sylvan Elf Clan Royal Family, either of Ascension Five or Ascension Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were dedicated to protecting Prince Chuck and Princess Joanna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were the first to bear the brunt of the Mud Golems' attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Ascension Four guard of the Sylvan Elf Clan was punched right in the chest by a Mud Golem. The divine power defense around his body only managed to offset a small fraction of the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The majority of the force penetrated his divine power shield, and his skin, and slammed into his internal organs and bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his body went limp like a noodle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no visible injury on the outside, but his internal organs and bones were completely shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His life force vanished in an instant, and his body fell into the swamp, slowly being swallowed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the second, the third, the fourth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One after another, the Sylvan Elf Clan guards were killed by the Mud Golems, and their bodies were swallowed by the swamp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prince Chuck, Princess Joanna, and even Letitia, Jaden, and Renata all wore expressions of horror on their faces, watching helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Prince Chuck's body moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally broke free from the restraint. Seeing his team members being killed one by one, his eyes turned blood-red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! I'll kill you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prince Chuck lashed out wildly. However, the real strength of the Mud Golems lay in their defense. Even though Chuck was of Ascension Six and was going all out, he could only knock them back. He simply couldn't pose a fatal threat to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he managed to fend off some of the Mud Golems, more of them were still attacking his team members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prince Chuck alone was no match for so many Mud Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he was in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So was Princess Joanna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone still alive around them was filled with despair. They all knew that facing more than twenty Mud Golems and already exhausted from their previous battles, Prince Chuck, who was now at the end of his tether, couldn't save them anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were going to be killed soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Princess Joanna watched as Chuck was going berserk, knowing full well that it was in vain but still refusing to flee alone. Tears welled up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Princess Joanna sobbed, her face streaked with tears, "Chuck, just go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave us alone! You've got to get out of here! If you don't go now, it'll be too late! Chuck, please, just go! Chuck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Princess Joanna was utterly desperate, pleading with Chuck to leave. With his Ascension Six strength, if he didn't have them as a burden, he might still have a chance to escape alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Prince Chuck seemed to turn a deaf ear at this moment. He was still going berserk and launching relentless attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He refused to leave and couldn't just abandon his sister and his squad members and flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Chuck was utterly exhausted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His divine power and soul power had been completely depleted in the previous battle. At this moment, he felt dizzy, and the world in front of his eyes became blurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Prince Chuck couldn't hold on any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He collapsed to the ground abruptly. He tried to get up, but it was all in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those two dozen or so Mud Golems, no longer impeded by him, quickly closed in again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their massive bodies exuded an overwhelming sense of oppression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chuck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, despair engulfed everyone. They could only watch helplessly as the two dozen or so Mud Golems raised their gigantic fists high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, a Mud Golem, standing a full 20 feet tall, lumbered up to Princess Joanna, Letitia, Jaden, and Renata. Its colossal fist, much larger than their bodies, was now raised high and came crashing down towards them with a terrifying gust of wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prince Chuck had already fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other guards of the Sylvan Elf Clan Royal Family were all facing their own perils. At this moment, no one could come to their rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were merely Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings. Facing these fearsome Mud Golems, they were utterly helpless. They could only watch as the massive fist grew larger and larger in their sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Death was looming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, no one noticed that two figures suddenly appeared about half a mile away. It was Osborne and Alfreda, who were rushing over at full speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the intense battle fluctuations, Osborne picked up the pace again. Regardless of the potential dangers in the swamp, he fully unleashed his interdimensional travel ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he reached a point about half a mile away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye scanned the area ahead, and Osborne immediately took in the entire situation clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were more than twenty huge Mud Golems running amok and carrying out a massacre!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prince Chuck had collapsed to the ground, completely spent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Princess Joanna, Letitia, Jaden, and Renata were now staring in horror at the massive Mud Golem in front of them as it brought down its terrifying fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair was written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne's face paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this split-second, Osborne didn't have the time to ponder what these Mud Golems were. Without hesitation, he activated his interdimensional travel ability once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he appeared in front of Princess Joanna and the others, blocking the path of the Mud Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the Mud Golem's gigantic fist, Osborne didn't have the time to mobilize his Sacred Power. He simply clenched his fist and punched out with his physical strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His puny fist looked so insignificant compared to the Mud Golem's massive one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Osborne's entire body was smaller than the Mud Golem's fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This punch seemed like a suicidal move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the two unequal fists collided violently, producing an ear-splitting sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwave radiated out in all directions, making people's eardrums ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the huge Mud Golem was sent flying backwards. Its fist, arm, and shoulder began to shatter in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then its body crashed heavily into the swamp and was swallowed up by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't in a good state either. The moment he clashed fists with the Mud Golem, he felt the terrifying power of the Mud Golem surging into his body, trying to shatter his internal organs and bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne's body had long since broken through its limits and become an Infinite Sacred Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Mud Golem's power was formidable, it wasn't enough to harm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne only staggered back two steps before regaining his balance. He quickly turned his head and looked at Princess Joanna and Letitia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "You guys okay?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
