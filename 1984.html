  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had his reasons for not wanting to rely on the God of Light to deal with the Baxter and Faulkner families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For one, he saw the God of Light and the God of Night as two sides of the same coin, best partners who had stood together against Lord Malevolence for a thousand years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But due to his complicated feelings about Isa, Osborne harbored a deep-seated resentment toward the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a simmering anger that he couldn't quite shake off, which made it hard for him to accept any help from the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why should Osborne involve her in resolving the issue with the two traitorous families?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The evidence of their betrayal was uncovered by him, so he would be the one to deal with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, by wiping out the Baxter and Faulkner families, he could harvest an immense amount of blood energy. This energy would allow him to elevate the cultivation levels of the Blood Demon members at an astonishing rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was exactly what he was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined forces of the Baxter and Faulkner families numbered in the millions. Aside from a few who surrendered, the rest were slain, including nearly a hundred Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer volume of blood energy generated was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne channeled this blood energy through the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, infusing it into the bodies of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, their cultivation levels began to soar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had previously been at the mid-Deity King level, but now, with the help of this blood energy, they quickly ascended to the late Deity King level, and then to the peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A full 10 thousand Blood Demon members reached their peak as Deity Kings, and astonishingly, the blood energy still hadn't run out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, such an abundance would have gone to waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members simply lacked the talent and potential to break through the peak Deity King level and become Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, everything had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had completely merged with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, gaining the ability of absolute control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members were essentially his Blood Golems, and their advancement faced no bottlenecks. As long as there was enough blood energy, they could keep rising in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, their cultivation levels could surpass even Osborne, their master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While the elevation of Blood Golems has no ceiling, breaking through from peak Deity King to Supernal Deity King requires an enormous amount of blood energy! The remaining energy should be enough to elevate a dozen or so Blood Demon members to Ascension One Supernal Deity King level, or perhaps even one to Ascension Two Supernal Deity King!" Osborne mused, glancing at his Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze finally landed on Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darren, step forward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren immediately emerged from the crowd, bowing respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, you called for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded, saying, "Darren, I've completed my full fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! I can now dissolve our master-servant bond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promised the God of Star that I would release you so you could pursue her without any reservations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm here to fulfill that promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, Darren's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, no! I can't agree to this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne interrupted, his voice firm, "Don't say another word! Right now, you're my Blood Golem, and we still have that master-servant bond, so of course, you're hesitant! But I can't let that stop you from chasing your happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Star is wonderful, and you shouldn't let her slip away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before I dissolve our bond, I'll raise your cultivation level to Ascension Two Supernal Deity King! Consider it my final gift to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After this, we'll be friends&mdash;buddies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Darren to respond, Osborne poured the last of the blood energy into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of power coursed through Darren's body, causing his features to contort as he struggled to contain the overwhelming energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Divine Flame rapidly fused with his Divine Body, propelling his cultivation level past the peak of Deity King and into Ascension One Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transformation was seamless; Blood Golems didn't need to face the Ascension Stairway trials to become Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a straightforward leap for Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't done yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining blood energy continued to push Darren's cultivation level even higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a tremendous aura erupted from Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had reached Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, surpassing Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief. "The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's 'absolute control' is truly terrifying! With enough blood energy, creating Supernal Deity Kings is a breeze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne focused again, pulling an invisible root from Darren's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren felt a jolt as he looked at Osborne, his eyes glistening with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand dismissively. "You're no longer my Blood Golem! I've dissolved our bond, so you don't need to call me 'my Lord' anymore! From now on, you're free to pursue your path. Go find the God of Star!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren gazed at Osborne, deeply moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he said, sincerity radiating from him, "My Lord! Everything I have is because of you! If it weren't for you, my life would have been ruined long ago! I might still be in the East Zone, enslaved and treated like a dog. I wouldn't have this life or this strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, whether our bond is severed or not, you will always be the person I respect the most! You will always be the one I pledge my life to!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I'm no longer a Blood Golem, I'll forever be your subordinate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Darren's face as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of emotion as well and waved his hand again. "Go on! Hurry up and find the God of Star! She's been waiting for you for ages, so make sure to treat her right. Otherwise, you'll see what I can do to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's face flushed at the teasing remark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hope shone in his eyes as he nodded vigorously. "My Lord, I'll go right away! I'll be back soon, and I'm still a part of the Blood Demon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot him a mock glare. "Make sure to spend time with the God of Star!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Darren took off, leaving Osborne to face the remaining Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I elevate all of your cultivation levels to Supernal Deity King, I'll dissolve our master-servant relationship too! Then you'll all be free!" he declared, ignoring the protests of his followers as he vanished from their sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Now, it's time to go back into seclusion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My current strength isn't enough to face a real warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to improve my Undead Cataclysm and Spatial Clone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, I'll never stand a chance against Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne closed his eyes, slipping into a state of deep meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flowed swiftly as he immersed himself in training, the world around him fading into a blur.</span></p><div class="pagination">
