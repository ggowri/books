  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I will only take on two&mdash;no, three personal disciples!" Angela </span><span>declared,</span><span> her expression resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Teaching three disciples is already stretching my limits! If I take on more, I fear I won't be able to guide you properly, and that could jeopardize your futures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'm sorry! Not accepting all of you as my personal disciples isn't a reflection of your abilities; it's simply a matter of my own constraints."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned her gaze toward Anastasia, Zoe, and Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the seven, these three stood out the most to her, and her teachings were best suited for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Bryce, Kendra, Diana, and Hannah, it wasn't that they weren't good enough; she just knew she wouldn't be able to teach them effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what do you think?" Angela asked, knowing that her decision hinged on his approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't agree, all her plans would be in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Angela felt a wave of anxiety wash over her, fearing a negative response from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Angela's surprise, he didn't seem disappointed that she chose only Anastasia, Zoe, and Mila. In fact, he looked pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a testament to Angela's sense of responsibility; it showed she genuinely wanted to invest in their growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she could have easily taken all seven if she'd wanted to, regardless of whether she could teach them well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne was really pleased with Angela. He was convinced that Anastasia, Zoe, and Mila would make much faster progress under Angela's guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, Ms. Olsen, for spotting their potential! I'm speaking for them when I say yes! Make sure you look after them, please," Osborne said, his voice calm and steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you three, don't forget to greet Ms. Olsen!" he added, then turned to Anastasia, Zoe, and Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of '</span><span>em</span><span> looked at each other, stepped forward, and bowed. "Ms. Olsen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Just great!" Angela beamed from ear to ear, </span><span>unable to</span><span> hide how happy she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None of that fancy stuff, okay? I'm not into all those strict rules. From now on, we're not just teacher and students, we're buds! Yeah, I've been around a bit longer, but I'll do my best to share what I know and help you guys outshine me. Become the top warriors on the whole Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was talking, an idea popped into her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached into her Dimensional Bag and pulled out three things, </span><span>each</span><span> giving off some serious energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quasi-Sacred Artifacts!" Osborne yelped, his eyes going wide as he realized how big a deal these things were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela gave Osborne a surprised look. She was impressed that he could recognize those artifacts so fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't think about it too much. Instead, she flashed a smile at Anastasia, Zoe, and Mila. "Now that you're my personal students, I don't have much, but I </span><span>wanna</span><span> give each of you something to help you stay safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could say no, she stuffed the items into their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three girls were totally caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were quasi-Sacred Artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they were a perfect fit for their power levels, which could make them even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding them felt like they were burning hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia frowned and tried to give the artifact back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen, this is way too much! We're already so thankful for you teaching us. There's no way we can take these quasi-Sacred Artifacts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shook her head </span><span>firmly</span><span>. "What's a quasi-Sacred Artifact compared to how happy I am to have you three as my students?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm over the moon! It's a pity I don't have anything better on me right now. But you can bet your bottom dollar, when I get the chance, I'll make sure each of you gets a Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sacred Artifact?!" Anastasia, Zoe, and Mila's eyes popped wide open in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since these are gifts from Ms. Olsen, you guys should take them!" Osborne butted </span><span>in,</span><span> his voice full of encouragement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, Ms. Olsen!" the three girls said in one voice, their faces brightening up with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela felt a rush of happiness. But when she looked at Kendra, Hannah, and the others, she saw a bit of envy in their eyes. A twinge of guilt hit her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip and spoke up, "Don't be bummed out! I told you I didn't take you in because I was </span><span>worried</span><span> I'd hold you back. But with how talented you are, any teacher would be dying to have you as their personal students!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's what I'll do&mdash;I'll hit up my closest senior and junior fellows and see if they can take you on. They're just as good as me, and they'll be even better at teaching you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela turned to Osborne, looking for his okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can we trust them?" Osborne asked, raising an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Definitely! You can count on it! My senior and junior fellows are all solid, and they'll pour their hearts into teaching </span><span>them</span><span>. They won't let you down!" Angela said, all sincere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, looking satisfied. "Then thanks a lot, Ms. Olsen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Angela started getting in touch with her fellow practitioners. She didn't even bother to keep it on the down-low from Osborne and the others. She whipped out her communication device and got cracking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amber, get your butt to </span><span>the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect! I've found some seriously talented students for you! I'm not kidding around! I swear they're all total prodigies, and you'll be over the moon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get here quick, or you'll miss out big time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keeley, it's Angela! Rush to </span><span>the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect. I've got some amazing students for you! When have I ever pulled the wool over your eyes? If I had more time and energy, I wouldn't be passing this golden opportunity your way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't come, you'll kick yourself later!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gwen, I know you've been on the hunt for personal students, and I've finally struck gold! She'll tick all your boxes! Right! Not only does she specialize in dark power, but she also majors in life power? What? You've reached the Cosmic Translocator? That's great, I'll hold tight for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Angela had gotten in touch with three of her fellow practitioners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched as Angela, a powerful Empyrean Sacredness warrior, chatted away just like an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela said with a smile, "Just wait a sec, they'll be here in a jiffy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me let you in on a little secret. I'm actually a trainee disciple at Fairy Moon Sect. If you know anything about Fairy Moon Sect, you'll know that my fellow practitioners are top-notch people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group went quiet, not showing much of a reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd never even heard of Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Osborne's eyes went wide in surprise. "Fairy Moon Sect?! The First-rate Power in Glorious Divine Kingdom? You're a trainee there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stoked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like they'd hit the jackpot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and Mila, since they've become Ms. Olsen's disciples, does that mean they could become full-fledged members of Fairy Moon Sect?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even Osborne felt a pang of envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I'd known Ms. Olsen was a trainee from Fairy Moon Sect, I should've stepped up my game earlier...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started toying with the idea of becoming a disciple himself!</span></p><div class="pagination">
