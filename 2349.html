  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You..." Seeing Osborne look at her, Agatha finally spoke, but realized she had no idea what to say.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All of this was so surreal that she even doubted whether the person in front of her was truly Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after carefully sensing, Agatha confirmed it was Osborne, because Osborne had fused with her nine drops of Phoenix Blood, creating a Bloodline Sensation between them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But precisely because she was sure this person was Osborne, Agatha found it even more unbelievable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Why would Osborne come to save me? How could Osborne possibly save me? All the warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan on the Racial Convergence Planet couldn't stop them together but instead threw me into deep space and chose collective self-destruction to buy me time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, Osborne saved me. Osborne is just an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King. Compared to the fallen warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan, Osborne's strength isn't that great."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you want to say?" Osborne said with a smile. "Do you want to ask why I came to save you? Or how I found you? It's actually quite simple. After fusing with your nine drops of Phoenix Blood, I discovered a Bloodline Sensation between us. When something happened to you, I immediately felt it and sensed your location."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was worried that your death would affect me, so I came to save you. That's all there is to it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, Agatha widened her eyes. "You can also sense my condition and location? Is Bloodline Sensation mutual?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha gritted her teeth and said, "Did you really come to save me just because you were worried my death would affect you? Actually, you don't need to worry about that. There's only Bloodline Sensation between us. Even if I die, it won't affect you at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shrugged and said, "You should have told me this earlier. If you had, I wouldn't have risked my life to save you. That guy with the black mask was too strong. I was almost scared to death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne deliberately put on a scared expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Agatha burst into laughter. "Were you scared? Why didn't I feel it? Anyway, thank you for saving me. I owe </span><span>you</span><span> my life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head and said, "It's too early to say that now. Because that man is still chasing us. We haven't shaken him off yet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's expression immediately changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She bit her lower lip and said, "Osborne, find a place to drop me off and leave quickly. I don't want to lie to you. This time, it's not just that one man chasing me, but a total of ten."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each of them is a top warrior at Empyrean Sacredness level. All the warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan joined forces but couldn't stop them, one by one falling to their deaths. Even our clan leader and deputy leader sacrificed themselves by self-destructing to save me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Agatha's eyes turned red, filled with overwhelming anger and hatred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Agatha quickly suppressed these emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Osborne and said seriously, "I don't want to cause more deaths. If ten top warriors at Empyrean Sacredness level want to kill me, no one on Racial Convergence Planet can save me. Don't worry about me anymore. You haven't been exposed yet, and they haven't regrouped or surrounded us. Quickly drop me off and leave immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's gaze was resolute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly and said, "Ten top warriors at Empyrean Sacredness level? This is indeed troublesome."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, I went through great effort to save you. How could I just leave you like this? No matter what, we have to try."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked outside, quickly thinking about how to completely shake off the pursuers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne..." Seeing Osborne unwilling to leave her behind, Agatha felt a bit touched, but she was still very anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew that with Osborne taking her along, escape was impossible, and it would only get Osborne killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha still insisted. "Osborne, don't worry about me. The leader among those chasing me likely has a special ability. He can track my scent and locate my approximate position through it. No matter where you take me, with their strength, they'll find me quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once we're surrounded, there will be no chance, and you'll be killed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Agatha's words, Osborne not only remained calm but even seemed a bit excited. "You're saying they track your scent to find you? In that case, if I hide your scent or change it, won't they be unable to find you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha was stunned, looking at Osborne in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just smiled and then took out the Sublime Concealment Orb from his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sublime Concealment Orb?" Agatha exclaimed, as she also recognized the Sublime Concealment Orb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Osborne in surprise. "You actually have a Sublime Concealment Orb. This is a very special treasure. There are fewer than a hundred Sublime Concealment Orbs in the cosmos, and all of them come from Umbra World. They are comparable to supreme </span><span>Sacred Artifacts. They possess powerful abilities to conceal auras, to the extent that even top warriors at the level of Empyrean Sacredness cannot detect anything unusual."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's words surprised Osborne a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew the Sublime Concealment Orb was precious, but he didn't expect it to be this rare, with fewer than a hundred in the cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "With the Sublime Concealment Orb, those pursuers' leaders shouldn't be able to lock onto your aura or determine your location anymore, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha nodded, then frowned and said, "Even with the Sublime Concealment Orb, we're not safe. If we can't shake off the person behind us, he'll keep sharing our location with others. Maybe the others have already circled ahead to surround us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "That is indeed a problem. But don't worry. I can't shake off the person behind us, but I can find a way to lure him away. As long as I distract him for a while, with the speed of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, we can lose him, and he won't be able to catch up again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne conjured a Spatial Clone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The appearance of the Spatial Clone quickly changed, soon transforming into Agatha's likeness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Spatial Clone?" Agatha murmured, "Are you planning to use the Spatial Clone to disguise as me and lure the person behind us away?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Inject a strand of Sacred Power into this Spatial Clone. That way, it will carry your aura. I'll have it escape in another direction later, and the person behind us will definitely be drawn to it. By the time he realizes something's wrong, we'll already be far away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, the Sublime Concealment Orb will hide your aura, making it impossible for anyone to find you. You can even use the Sublime Concealment Orb to live under a new identity. As long as you don't reveal the power of the Dark Phoenix, no one will know you're the Dark Phoenix."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, Agatha instantly became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes were filled with anticipation. If she could survive, why would she choose to die? If she could live under a new identity, out in the light without hiding, that would be even better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha said firmly, "Alright, let's give it a try. Osborne, thank you for everything you've done for me. If I really survive this time, I will never forget your kindness."</span></p><div class="pagination">
