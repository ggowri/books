  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The accumulated blood energy here was enough to empower nearly two thousand Blood Demon members to forge Divine Bodies, propelling them into the realm of gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought almost made Osborne lose his breath. That kind of power would be sheer madness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could rally two thousand newly ascended Blood Demons, what did he have to fear from the Deschanel Clan? No more schemes or manipulation needed to set them against the League of Divine Descent&mdash;he could march straight in with an army of Blood Demon members and wipe the slate clean!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two thousand! If that happened, not a single dominant force would be able to stand against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as excitement bubbled up within him, Osborne quickly reined in his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength of these ruling factions didn't solely stem from their current prowess; they were a tapestry woven with threads of ancient warriors, survivors from the Age of Gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These warriors weren't fully awakened yet, but their power, when roused, would be nothing short of terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, deep within their sanctum lay sixty-three Sanctuary Caskets, each housing a warrior of immense potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one could pack a punch stronger than Joseph's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was Terrence, the clan's elder and a peak Deity Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't awake yet, but if the Deschanel Clan found themselves at death's door, those ancient guardians might just rise to protect their legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, that would be a real headache!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The League of Divine Descent had its own set of hidden warriors, too. There had been over twenty Intermediate Deities that appeared out of nowhere when the League was </span><span>on the verge of collapse, and they were no pushovers themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With power levels soaring to Transcendent and Celestial Deities, their full return would be disastrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, calming his racing thoughts. "Hold your horses! Just because two thousand Blood Demons might ascend doesn't mean I should start celebrating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These powerful factions, like the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League, are steeped in strength. Back them into a corner, and those ancient folks will wake up&mdash;then I'll be in real trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if I really do get two thousand Blood Demons to ascend, I won't need to fear these ruling powers as much. If they try to come after me? Fine! I'll make sure to take a piece of them with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, a sense of ease settled over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All things </span><span>considered,</span><span> Osborn had played his cards right. By secretly orchestrating the battle between the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League, he had scored big&mdash;not only had he drained their strength, but he'd also accrued a massive amount of blood energy, which was enough to catalyze the transformation of his Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's see how this war wraps up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he cast his gaze back to the battlefield, he noticed something odd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eighteen remaining divine warriors of the Deschanel Clan seemed to be in retreat, pulling back amidst the furious chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, surprised. "Oh? The Deschanel Clan is calling it quits? Makes sense, though. "Out of their thirty-six godly warriors, they've already lost half. Sure, they took down quite a few from the Pantheon League, but most of those were Junior Deities. Right now, the scales are tipped towards a stalemate&mdash;no one can really get the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this is Pantheon League's territory! Who knows, they might still have more warriors ready to jump in at any moment. If that happens, the Deschanel Clan would be in real trouble&mdash;they could end up wiped out right here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, pulling back is a smart move for them! There's no way they can completely crush the Pantheon League now. Heading back to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> is the best decision they could make. If it were me, I'd be getting my folks out of here, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the question is, will the Pantheon League let them just walk away? If they decide to wipe out the Deschanel Clan here and now, they'd definitely rouse more warriors to hunt them down. If it comes to that, I'd have to step in again, taking out a few more Pantheon League fighters to keep things in check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Pantheon League can't fall! And the Deschanel Clan can't be allowed to perish either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to </span><span>himself,</span><span> his gaze fixed on the Pantheon League members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, that looming scenario didn't unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the remaining warriors of the Pantheon League saw the Deschanel Clan retreating, a wave of excitement washed over them. They surged forward, intent on pursuing, but Helios quickly stepped in to halt the frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios called out, his expression serious, "Hold it right there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With our current strength, even if we catch up, we wouldn't stand a chance at wiping them all out unless we head to the Mount of Gods and wake up more elder deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But doing so would massively impact their recovery. The price of waking them up prematurely is steep&mdash;their healing speed would be reduced by ten times! Plus, it could leave lasting damage, making it hard for them to reach their peak performance again, let alone push past it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just not worth that kind of sacrifice to take out the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget, they probably still have dormant elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they're really cornered, you can bet the Deschanel Clan will wake them up when they absolutely need to, and then we'd really be in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Helios finished, anger spread across the faces of the Pantheon League warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we really just going to let this slide?" one of them shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've taken down so many of us! We can't let them get away with this!" another barked, fists clenched in frustration.</span></p><div class="pagination">
