  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time went on, Osborne's pace of gathering Essence Crystals accelerated. Every few hours, he managed to clear out the areas with the highest densities of Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The haul just kept getting bigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He settled into a rhythm: ten hours of digging followed by two hours of rest. With this routine, he quietly scoured the No. 13 mining area, focusing on the spots that produced the most top-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any area that didn't belong to the Mystic Feather Clan was fair game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each day, he could easily clear two to three zones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the top twenty zones, seven belonged to the Mystic Feather Clan, which meant he only needed to clear thirteen zones to achieve his goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, within four to five days, Osborne could completely strip the top twenty zones bare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had transformed into a tireless super miner, and as the days slipped by, he lost track of just how many Essence Crystals he had amassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to count them all once he finished gathering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four days passed in a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, only Zone 3 and Zone 1 remained untouched, while Zone 2 was firmly under the control of the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne found himself deep within the core of Zone 3, methodically using his spatial energy to transfer mid-grade and top-grade Essence Crystals from a six-mile radius into his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After countless repetitions, he could perform this task with his eyes closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past four days, Osborne's mastery over spatial energy had soared to unprecedented heights. His precision control of this energy had rapidly improved, allowing him to instantaneously unleash thousands upon thousands of spatial energies. Each spatial energy thread was as responsive and manipulable as his own fingers, enabling him to deftly wield them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was worth noting that Osborne's cultivation system was unique; he could seamlessly switch between divine power and elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An improvement in his control over spatial energy meant that his grasp of divine power had also grown stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While this wouldn't directly boost his combat strength, it would allow him to navigate battles with greater ease and finesse, pushing his control to its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt confident that his mastery of power was already on par with most Deity Overlord warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, a flicker of anticipation igniting within him, "Finally, I can sense the bottleneck of the Transcendent Deity realm! I should break through to Transcendent Deity in the next couple of days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he hadn't engaged in any formal training lately, his Infinite Devouring Eyes had been tirelessly consuming various spiritual energies deep within the No. 9 mining area, effectively replacing his own cultivation efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of this absorption was far superior to what he could achieve with top-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that his breakthrough to Transcendent Deity was imminent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of impending advancement grew stronger, prompting Osborne to quicken his pace in gathering Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I clear out Zone 3, I'll head to Zone 1! I'll find a quiet spot there to focus on my breakthrough. After that, I can strip Zone 1 clean and finally head back to Wild Flame City! My vacation is almost over, after all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne swiftly finished gathering the Essence Crystals in Zone 3, amassing a significant amount before silently moving on to Zone 1.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zone 1 belonged to the Demonic Dragon Clan, and within this cl, the most powerful family was the Royston family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their claim on Zone 1 made them confident; after all, they believed that no one would dare to intrude on their turf to steal Essence Crystals. This overconfidence translated into weak defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even if those defenses were strong, it wouldn't make a difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could slip seamlessly through parallel spaces, and up until now, no one had managed to detect him hidden there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even a Deity Overlord warrior would catch a glimpse of his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With ease, Osborne navigated to the deepest part of Zone 1, where he discovered an abandoned mine. Without hesitation, he settled into a meditative position and </span><span>prepared to breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At last, I'm about to break through to Transcendent Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the pinnacle of Superior Deity, I could take down Deity Overlord </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> and hold my ground against someone like Fabian. Once I ascend to Transcendent Deity, my strength will truly align with that of a Deity Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I should be able to hold my own against someone like Fabian and even defeat talents like Hannah, who are at the peak of Celestial Deity and geniuses from Upper Races!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I can achieve all this without even tapping into my spatial or dark powers! Imagine how formidable I'll be if I unleash those powers whenever I want!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could easily take down any average Deity Overlord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thrill of such power coursed through him, but Osborne quickly suppressed his rising excitement, focusing intently on his breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep hum filled the air as the energy surrounding him began to vibrate, its intensity growing stronger with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, he had mastered a technique that masked his energy fluctuations, or the nearby miners would surely notice such a significant disturbance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt himself getting closer to the Transcendent Deity realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Osborne didn't yet realize was that a magnificent and imposing Malevolence Airship was swiftly making its way into Zone 1 of the No. 13 mining area.</span></p><div class="pagination">
