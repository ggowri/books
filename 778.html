  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old man nodded quickly as if afraid that if he spoke too slowly, Isa would beat him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Night, putting your name on the Godson Rankings is certainly doable. However, given your strength, I feel that placing you there would be a disservice to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa smiled faintly. "Just do what I ask. Why are you overthinking it? I'm merely toying with a young one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she spoke, Isa smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old man was momentarily stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's face turned cold again as she said calmly, "By the way, while you're at it, tell me where the person I'm looking for is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, the old man's expression changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Night, I haven't foretold anything in a long time. With my current condition, if I attempt it again, I might... die."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa responded calmly, "I'm here. What are you afraid of? I'll make sure you won't die."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gritting his teeth, the old man took out several ancient coins and tossed them into the air. They transformed into shining spots of light, eventually converging and pointing in a direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old man spat out a mouthful of blood, his complexion quickly turning ashen. His skin, like tree bark, aged rapidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this, Isa immediately waved her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A terrifying power surged into the old man's body, instantly stabilizing him. His pale face regained its color, becoming rosy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if he had instantly regained twenty years of youth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Overcome with excitement, the old man knelt before Isa, exclaiming, "Thank you, Ms. Night!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa waved dismissively. "Tell me, what did you foresee?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old man's expression turned serious. "Ms. Night, the person you're looking for is in Tethynia, but I couldn't pinpoint her exact location."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tethynia? So, she's really there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa murmured, waving her hand casually. "Stay here. I'm leaving now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Isa's figure vanished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Farewell, Ms. Night!" The old man bowed respectfully toward where Isa had been, only raising his head long after she had left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Someone, go update the Godson Rankings!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Osborne was about to put his phone down, having memorized all the names on both the Godson and Quasi-Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had also memorized their appearances and basic information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert Williamson, holding his Honor Quest Ceremony tomorrow, was ranked 35th.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the highest rank among the younger generation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No wonder he dares to hold an Honor Quest Ceremony!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne muttered. After all, if Cuthbert wasn't among the top ranks of the younger generation, holding such a ceremony would be meaningless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne then thought of himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt a little helpless. Cuthbert, the strongest of the younger generation, was holding his Honor Quest Ceremony to aim for S-Class status.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne still couldn't figure out why the Godfather had insisted he hold his own Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll wait and see how Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony goes tomorrow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne mumbled, getting ready to put his phone away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the screen on his phone flickered. He quickly looked at it and was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared in disbelief at the top of the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone had held the top spot codenamed "Lord," a name that had even been marked in silver by the Diviner League.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, that name had changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Night!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The first name on the Godson Rankings was now "Night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The name wasn't written in silver, nor in gold, but...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Black!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Deep, pitch-black letters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was dumbfounded. Others might not have known who this "Night" was, but Osborne was almost certain that it had to be Isa!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Night Witch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Night!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on? Isa's name wasn't on the list just moments ago. How did it suddenly appear at the top?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was completely shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ron noticed Osborne's reaction. He glanced at Osborne's phone before standing up abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What the hell?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ron exclaimed, "The top spot on the Godson Rankings has changed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment he said this, silence fell all around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone stared at him in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ron, are you crazy? How could the top spot change? Who could be stronger than Lord below S-Class Supreme Overlord?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ridiculous!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many scoffed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ron's face flushed red with anger. "Why would I lie? Don't believe me? Check for yourselves! Lord is no longer number one on the Godson Rankings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's 'Night'!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just a codename. No name, no photo, not even an age!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could the Diviner League have made a mistake?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who is 'Night'?!"</p><div class="pagination">
