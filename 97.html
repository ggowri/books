  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna looked contemptuous. &ldquo;Why am I poisoned?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, she glanced at Osborne. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Osborne&rsquo;s reminder, she might have been poisoned by eating the candy Paul gave her. In that case, she would have lost her power and could only watch Clarissa being killed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her heart was filled with worry, and she was grateful to Osborne for the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She came to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, leave the old man to me. Go protect Clarissa and kill all the enemies. Remember, you have to be careful with that traitor. That traitor is very strong.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that, Osborne nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He smiled. &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll keep Ms. Radcliffe safe.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Osborne backed to the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The battle between Donna and Raymond began. The battle scene between the two top metahumans was overwhelming, and it was not for anyone else to intervene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The others didn&rsquo;t have time to look on as the battle continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without a threat from Raymond, the men of Bodyguard Unit Three and Bodyguard Unit Four got out of the car and used the cover to shoot at each other with the remaining enemies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But their hitting percentage was just too low.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed to Osborne that these guys were just hiding behind the cover, raising their guns high in the air and firing as hard as they could without aiming. They might not hit a single enemy even if they ran out of bullets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But they couldn&rsquo;t be blamed for that. That was the real battlefield.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, they didn&rsquo;t have Osborne&rsquo;s Satan&rsquo;s Eye to see through the cover. If they dared to look at the enemy, they&rsquo;d probably be shot in the head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were mercenary bodyguards who were paid. They&rsquo;d be stupid if they went out of the cover to start a death charge, regardless of the danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If the enemy did the same, this war would be fought for a long time without being able to distinguish a winner from a loser.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, their enemies were a bunch of mad dogs who dared to die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne saw a group of black-clad men coming straight out of the cover and charging desperately towards them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They dropped their guns. Their bodies quickly sprouted long black hairs as they ran, and their eyes became scarlet. With that, they slumped down and turned into four-legged runners extremely fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if stray bullets hit them, they didn&rsquo;t hurt at all and continued to run.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked grave and thought, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re shape-shifting metahumans, werewolves.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He immediately shouted over the intercom, &ldquo;Ms. Smith, Ms. Foster, watch out! Enemy&rsquo;s shape-shifting metahumans are out, about forty werewolves.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Osborne raised his gun and shot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With Satan&rsquo;s Eye, Osborne&rsquo;s hit rate was extremely high. Unfortunately, the Draco Model H handgun was so weak that it could only penetrate the skin of the werewolves at best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, nearly twenty werewolves rushed to Clarissa&rsquo;s car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other twenty werewolves rushed the other bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne couldn&rsquo;t care about anyone else anymore. More than two dozen werewolves were charging at him at the same time, giving him a tremendous amount of pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He yelled at Clarissa, &ldquo;Unlock the doors from the inside and don&rsquo;t come out.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After that, he put away his handgun and took out two alloy daggers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were Class B utility daggers made by the Draco Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While they were much less expensive than the Class B Defensive Soft Armor, they were still a whopping five million dollars each and made of the toughest alloys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On top of that, the two daggers were inlaid with energy devices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They would release high-voltage electricity every time they hit an enemy, instantly stiffening and paralyzing the enemy&rsquo;s body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne swung his alloy daggers and charged into the werewolves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Compared to the first time he fought with the werewolves, Osborne was more experienced and stronger. In particular, with Satan&rsquo;s Eye upgraded to the third level, his ocular energy could manipulate substances. At critical times, Osborne could use ocular energy to restrain the movements of the werewolves temporarily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In just one instant, Osborne&rsquo;s daggers would pierce their hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne kept swinging his daggers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The alloy daggers of Class B were incomparably sharp. Even if the werewolves had high defenses, they simply couldn&rsquo;t resist them. They would be seriously injured whenever they were hit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And the high-voltage electricity released by the daggers could instantly stiffen the werewolf, briefly rendering them immobile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, they were stabbed through the heart by Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, a dozen corpses of werewolves fell in front of Osborne. The fetid blood almost recolored Clarissa&rsquo;s car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa, inside the car, was stunned at this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just two days ago, Osborne had fought incredibly hard against ten werewolves. If it hadn&rsquo;t for her desperately healing him from behind, Osborne would have been no match at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And now, faced with more werewolves, Osborne slaughtered the werewolves with ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne wasn&rsquo;t hurt and didn&rsquo;t need her treatment at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How did he get so strong?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa murmured, staring intently at Osborne&rsquo;s fighting figure. Her eyes were filled with softness and emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne saves me again</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> she thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">Time and time again, this man shows up when I&rsquo;m most in danger and need protection, like a Prince Charming, to save my life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa was very touched by this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, she saw a dark shadow eerily appear behind Osborne and slam his fist into Osborne&rsquo;s head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa was instantly anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, watch out!&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
