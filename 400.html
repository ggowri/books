  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in confusion, and his hands froze in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Did Isa kiss me forcibly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just kissed me forcibly because I had kissed her before, and she felt defeated, so she wanted to kiss me back, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did she think that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When did Isa get so bold?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought she hadn't even been in a relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was confused. Being pressed against the wall by Isa, he couldn't move at all. However, he was already a Class A martial master, and his body had mutated, so his strength was far stronger than ordinary Class A martial masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't resist at all in Isa's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just felt Isa's action was awkward, and she kept knocking her teeth against his lips, which Osborne couldn't help but find funny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Can you do it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do you know how to kiss? You don't even know how to kiss, but you're learning how to kiss me forcibly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt funny inside. He wanted to say that, but he didn't dare because he could feel Isa's body trembling slightly at that moment, and she looked nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was flustered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne dared to say that, he could be sure that what was waiting for him was definitely that Isa would beat him furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Osborne could only tolerate her clumsy kisses in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Osborne couldn't resist, he needed to enjoy it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's lips had a faint floral scent. Despite her clumsy kisses, Osborne felt comfortable. After a moment's hesitation, he finally lowered his hands and wrapped them around Isa's delicate waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he felt Isa's body shudder again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, she didn't move or push Osborne's hands away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne seemed to be encouraged as he began to dominate and cater to Isa, who was clumsy. Soon, he was sucking on her tongue and gently flirting with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Isa's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body froze, but she still didn't push Osborne away. Under Osborne's guidance, she began to cooperate with Osborne's kiss, their tongues intertwining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt his body burn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that Isa's power to control him had disappeared. He stepped forward at once and held Isa tighter, so that her body was tilted backward and completely pressed against his chest as he kissed her more passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had a bewildered look in her eyes at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she kissing Osborne forcibly or was Osborne doing it to her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa thought it seemed to feel pretty good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She closed her eyes and let Osborne hold her and kiss her passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breathing gradually became heavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't satisfied to just hold Isa's delicate waist, so he slowly touched downward with his hand. Without causing Isa to resist, he kept moving his hands downward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he touched Isa's sexy hips with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa opened her eyes instantly, her eyes still filled with bewilderment and astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next second, her eyes became calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a burst of sound, Osborne's body was slapped out of the way by her, slamming heavily against the wall of the mansion and leaving a human-sized crater in the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did Isa, who had just been cooperating with him, suddenly hit him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He covered his chest, looking helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Isa's face was flushed, and she didn't even dare to look Osborne in the eye. She used the back of her hand to wipe the drool that remained at the corner of her mouth, and her face turned even more flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa snorted coldly, "You kissed me forcibly before, and I didn't do anything to you, but you provoked me with an illusion today. So, now that I have kissed you forcibly, we are even. In the future, if you come back and dare to provoke me, I will definitely beat you up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying this, Isa didn't even dare to look up and was ready to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we even?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, were you sure you kissed me forcibly today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Isa and thinking about the scene that just happened, Osborne suddenly grabbed Isa's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Isa's surprised gaze, Osborne pulled Isa into his arms with a slight push.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hugged Isa's delicate waist again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's eyes widened as she looked up slightly at Osborne. She felt Osborne's face only about an inch away from hers, and they could even feel each other's breath. She seemed confused and forgot to struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, "Isa, do you want to get even with me? No way. I just kissed you for a second before, but you just kissed me for a full minute!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So it's still my loss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to be even with me, you should let me kiss you forcibly for another fifty-nine seconds!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, Osborne made up his mind. He didn't care what the consequences would be, and he suddenly lowered his head and kissed Isa on the lips again, sucking in her tongue instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne only kissed her for one second before, and she kissed Osborne for one minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, did Osborne have to kiss her forcibly for another fifty-nine seconds for them to get even?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was that so?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was no longer conscious. She felt something was wrong and wanted to kick Osborne off, but after feeling Osborne's kiss, she suddenly felt reluctant to do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was this what it felt like to be in love? Only people in love kiss each other, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa suddenly closed her eyes again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A minute had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was over two minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It even exceeded three minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Isa didn't refuse him, Osborne tried once again to do something with his hands. He didn't hesitate this time, and he just hold Isa's sexy hips instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's body shuddered, but she did nothing, much less punch Osborne out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne got even more excited.</span></p><div class="pagination">
