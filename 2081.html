  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just before Alfreda counted to three, fear gripped Nell's heart. The lethal glimmer in Alfreda's eyes sent her spiraling into a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed, "I was wrong! Princess Alfreda, I understand now! I shouldn't have offended Mr. Augustine! I apologize to him&mdash;please grant me your forgiveness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her desperate cries sliced through the silence of the inn like a knife, her nails digging into the wooden floorboards. "It was my fault! Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, veins bulged on Nell's neck, each word feeling like she was swallowing shards of glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please forgive me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda let out a cold huff, lightly waving her hand. The vines hovered ominously just above Nell's brow, the sudden rush of wind trimming a lock of her hair, inducing a violent tremor through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smirk, Alfreda turned to Osborne. "Did you hear that? She's begging for your forgiveness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Alfreda with a mix of resignation and admiration, giving a slight nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Pierce, Killian, and Harley hurriedly prostrated, their voices overlapping in a flurry of apologies. "We all know we were wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda cast a frosty glance at them and replied, "Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the four of them scrambled to make their escape, fear evident in their hurried step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were gone, the icy demeanor on Alfreda melted away, revealing a playful gleam in her eyes as she turned to Osborne. "Feeling satisfied now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was deeply moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Alfreda to confront Nell and her crew, even going so far as to force an apology from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, the power she demonstrated was awe-inspiring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I didn't activate my absolute forbidden zone, I would be no match for Alfreda! She handled all four Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings with such ease! No wonder she scored Class SS on the Astral Testing Arch!" Osborne thought to himself, admiration swelling in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Alfreda, thank you! But you really didn't have to do all this! Those four have decent power, and if we just explained things, they might've stuck around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda pouted at his words. "So what if they have decent power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care! You're my friend, and if they disrespect you, they're disrespecting me! Even if they reluctantly agreed to join my exploration team, who knows what trouble they'd cause on Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"People like that are the last I need!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When it comes to joining my team, strength is secondary&mdash;the most important thing is having good character! Otherwise, we'd be swamped with problems down the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, I've already sent them packing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's just forget about it! I believe others will want to join my exploration team. If not, it's no big deal; we can go in just the two of us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really not a problem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's easygoing nature brought a smile to Osborne's face, though he was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed at her, feeling a wave of gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew this trip to Umbra Earth was crucial for Alfreda. If she couldn't collect ten Flame Gold Crystals as compensation for Monica, her past mistakes would come back to haunt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, she'd either be kicked out of Elf City or confined to the Dungeon of Stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was acutely aware of the pressure weighing on her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it meant risking everything, she was willing to take Osborne into Umbra Earth. She had no idea about his real strength. On the surface, Osborne appeared to be at the lowest Ascension One level, making him seem like nothing more than a hindrance to everyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To safeguard him, Alfreda had driven away four powerful allies, even taking action herself to teach them a lesson, forcing them to apologize to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Osborne not feel moved by that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne truly saw Alfreda as a friend he could trust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I should show a bit of my strength, just to let Alfreda know I'm not a liability," Osborne thought to himself, but his musings were interrupted by a knock at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's excitement was palpable. "Look! Someone else wants to join my exploration team!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, three figures cloaked in gray robes stepped into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader, a woman with a raspy voice, spoke first, "Greetings, Princess Alfreda! We heard you're recruiting for your team, and we'd like to join!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the woman pulled back her hood, revealing a face covered in shimmering scales that glowed a vibrant green.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Avery Robbie, Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, Class A on the Astral Testing Arch, from the Voidborne Dragon Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her left, a man removed his hood, revealing a mechanical eye that flickered with a crimson light. "I'm Godfrey Kloss, Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, Class B on the Astral Testing Arch, from the Gearsoul Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a metallic box floated behind him, unfolding to reveal twelve elegantly engraved Pulse Rifles, their surfaces shimmering with intricate Divine Marks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Gearsoul Clan was a rare high-tier race in the cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but feel curious about those Pulse Rifles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Could they pose a threat to a Supernal Deity King?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can bring those back to Blue Planet, they'll keep scientists busy for ages!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last figure stepped forward, pulling back her cloak to reveal a peculiar form&mdash;a carnivorous plant with a delicate voice that sounded like a child's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Hermione Snape, Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, Class A on the Astral Testing Arch, from the Flora Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, the three figures began to transform, shifting into the elegant forms of the Elf Race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda beamed at them. "Welcome! You all have the strength to join my exploration team! But there's one thing I need to make clear first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm the captain of this team, and while we're on Umbra Earth, you must follow my orders! Don't worry, I won't send you on any suicide missions. If you have ideas or concerns, feel free to share them, and I'll consider them carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprised looks crossed their faces, but they nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's absolutely fine! You're the captain, and it's because of you that we have this chance to enter Umbra Earth. Naturally, we'll follow your lead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded, then suddenly pushed Osborne in front of the three newcomers, her tone turning serious. "This is Osborne Augustine. He's my friend, and I'm taking him into Umbra Earth with us! He's the vice-captain of the team! His level is only Ascension One, so I need everyone's help to ensure his safety while we're there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't accept that, then please leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda fixed her gaze on the trio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Osborne, sensing the determination radiating from Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfrey's mechanical eye focused intently on Osborne, data streaming rapidly across his vision. "Scanning complete. He's from the Human Community and indeed at the Ascension One Supernal Deity King level. However, his energy levels seem unusually high! If he's to be our vice-captain, I'd recommend a reassessment... but if the captain insists, we'll comply!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Godfrey finished, both Avery and Hermione nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're on board!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, we truly admire your spirit of not giving up on your companions! Once we enter Umbra Earth, we'll do our utmost to protect him! Of course, if you expect us to sacrifice ourselves to save him, that's a different story... we can only promise to protect him to the best of our abilities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes sparkled with delight at their words.</span></p><div class="pagination">
