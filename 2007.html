  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire Sanctum of Light was, in fact, a massive divine artifact, incredibly sturdy and impenetrable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall they were currently in was spacious, but it was far from enough for Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings to fight freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as God of Light hesitated, trying to decide where they should spar, Osborne suddenly acted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, faint waves of spatial power filled the entire hall. While the hall itself remained the same, its interior space expanded countless times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial magnification?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light stared at Osborne in shock. "I didn't expect your spatial power to have reached such a level! Even if the God of Space were still alive, her mastery over spatial energy wouldn't surpass yours by much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "Thank you for the compliment, God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, we can officially begin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light nodded. Osborne's display of spatial magnification had once again raised her opinion of him. She turned to the eight Ascension Four Radiant Guardians and said, "Be careful. Don't treat him like an ordinary Ascension One Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the most extraordinary prodigy the Human Community has produced in hundreds, if not thousands, of years! You're Ascension Fours&mdash;if you underestimate him and lose, it'll be a disgrace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight Radiant Guardians remained calm despite her warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with God of Light's caution, they still didn't take Osborne and his team seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was merely an Ascension One Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in strength between them was simply too vast. Even if Osborne was the most brilliant prodigy in a millennium, there was no way he could threaten them while still at Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even the legendary Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community could have done it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light couldn't do it either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nor could the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, God of Light. We'll make sure to&nbsp;properly&nbsp;guide them!" one of the Radiant Guardians said, his tone laced with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a powerful energy began radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other seven followed suit, surrounding themselves with energy and assuming defensive stances. It was clear they had no intention of attacking first, waiting instead for Osborne's team to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, if they attacked first, the fight would end in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet even in defense, the divine power emanating from them was overwhelming and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, not even an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King could break through their defenses without some special technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you can begin now," God of Light said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "Show me what makes you so confident that you think you're ready to participate in an Ascension Four competition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, God of Light felt an intense anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she doubted it was possible, prodigies were always exceptional. She couldn't help but wonder if Osborne had some unique ability that allowed him to challenge Ascension Fours despite being an Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She watched Osborne closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and struck without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you want to see it, I'll show you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolute Forbidden Zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hum!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made his move. A massive blood-red lotus phantom appeared behind him, then exploded, engulfing every corner of the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a strange transformation took place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings facing Osborne and his team felt their divine power rapidly weakening, their levels being forcefully suppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension One!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, all eight of them, previously at Ascension Four, were suppressed to Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing their levels had been suppressed, they panicked and quickly unleashed their power in an attempt to break free from the suppression&mdash;and they partially succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, they managed to break part of the suppression and restored their levels to Ascension Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ascension Two was their absolute limit. No matter how much they struggled, they couldn't restore their original levels any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, the battle began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack! Defeat them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke calmly, and immediately, Anastasia, Zoe, and the rest of the seven unleashed their attacks. Their coordinated and overwhelming strikes surrounded the eight Radiant Guardians.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the eight Radiant Guardians still had Ascension Two levels while Osborne's team remained at Ascension One, the Guardians were soon shocked to find they were utterly no match for Anastasia's group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without Osborne joining the fight, they couldn't hold their ground!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the rest of the team were far too powerful. Despite being only Ascension One, their combat strength was enough to give even Ascension Three opponents a serious headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their Divine Bodies, elemental essence, and even their Divine Ascendance Techniques far exceeded what should be possible at their level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, in the blink of an eye, the eight Radiant Guardians&mdash;whose levels had been suppressed&mdash;were soundly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the entire fight, Osborne didn't lift a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight Radiant Guardians lay on the ground, heavily injured and utterly bewildered. Even after Hannah used her life energy to heal their wounds, they remained stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings, defeated by seven Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings&mdash;without even putting up a proper fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To call it a one-sided massacre wouldn't be an exaggeration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even God of Light shot to her feet, staring at the scene in utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes gleamed as she fixed her gaze firmly on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke each word slowly, enunciating clearly, "The... Primordial... Crimson... Lotus of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow in surprise. "God of Light, you're familiar with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I know! A thousand years ago, the God of Night tried to claim the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity but failed. He claimed that it possessed unimaginable power, enough to help him rival Lord Malevolence and even defeat him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he failed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And to think that what the God of Night couldn't obtain has now fallen into your hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished speaking, a hint of regret crossed God of Light's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, looked rather pleased with himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night had failed to claim the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, but Osborne had succeeded. This time, the victory was his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "It doesn't matter who possesses the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, as long as it's used to deal with Lord Malevolence... Besides, I've already proven our strength. God of Light, do you still think we're unqualified to join the Ascension Four competition? Or that we can't win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light opened her mouth but found herself at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, she finally asked, "The technique you just used to suppress their levels&mdash;how stable is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Completely stable!" Osborne replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne explained, "That's the ability of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity&mdash;Absolute Forbidden Zone! Within a certain range, I can stabilize the suppression of any cultivators below Ascension Three to match my level. And when we're at the same level...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm unbeatable. Everyone else? They're fair game!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
