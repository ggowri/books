  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney sensed something was wrong and hurriedly ordered everyone to regroup to avoid being picked off by Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But, unfortunately, his command came too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had been relentlessly attacking. His Satan's Eye was far more powerful than anyone else's, allowing him to see his enemies clearly while remaining invisible to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, the energy pistol and its bullets had immense penetrating power, and Osborne's marksmanship was impeccable. Every shot he took was lethal, leaving them almost no room for defense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the enemy teams rushed to converge on Rodney, Osborne snorted coldly and increased his firing speed, determined to take down as many as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a flurry of gunshots, the enemies felt the crisis intensify. They desperately tried to defend themselves and flee, but they couldn't outrun the energy bullets. They were hit in the chest or thigh, screaming in agony as they fell to the ground, completely losing their ability to fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Twenty-five!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thirty!" Osborne silently counted in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, after Osborne had taken down the thirty-second enemy, the remaining enemies gathered around Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney unleashed a powerful energy, enveloping them all in protection. Even the energy bullets couldn't penetrate his defenses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, Rodney's mastered Stretch Soft Force as well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This energy pistol alone won't break through his Stretch Soft Force defense!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne muttered to himself, finally ceasing his attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sneered as he watched Rodney. Seeing Rodney's frantic and angry expression filled Osborne with satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's your next move, Rodney?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney looked at the thirteen remaining allies around him, his face dark with rage, his eyes burning with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't believe he was down to just thirteen men!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney never imagined that what seemed like a flawless trap would end with him losing thirty-two of his men. The sheer magnitude of the loss made him seethe with fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How the hell did he do it?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney clenched his fists and growled in frustration. He couldn't comprehend how Osborne could have taken out thirty-two of his men in just a few minutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, even he couldn't pull off such a feat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These weren't just ordinary fighters. They were all top-tier experts, at least Class A, with many even being Class A+. Rodney couldn't fathom how they could have suffered such a devastating defeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The remaining survivors looked equally grim. Their eyes were filled with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They exchanged anxious glances, just as baffled by the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We didn't even see Osborne, so how did we lose so many comrades?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is terrifying!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It must be that Osborne has a powerful ancient magic weapon capable of long-range attacks. Its penetrating power is overwhelming, and our defenses can't hold up against it." Finally, someone spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"More importantly, Osborne's Satan's Eye is clearly stronger than ours! We can't see him, but he knows our every move!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's attacking from where we can't see him. We can't defend against it or fight back, which is why we've taken such heavy losses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he finished speaking, Rodney fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face was a mix of shock, frustration, and bewilderment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had frozen the space within a 30-mile radius, confident that restricting Osborne's spatial power would allow him to capture Osborne and seize the Heir's Emblem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, without even catching a glimpse of Osborne, he had already suffered a devastating loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney never imagined that Osborne would make him more worried when fighting back than when fleeing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, he felt utterly at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney suddenly felt a wave of confusion wash over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He clenched his fists, his face full of rage. Suddenly, he shouted, "Osborne, if you've got the guts, come out and face me in a fair fight! Hiding in the shadows and ambushing us is what a coward does! In that case, even if you become the heir, I'll never respect you. No one will!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're a man, come out and fight me, beat me head-on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney yelled, his voice carrying far and wide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne heard him but merely curled his lips in disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "He's panicking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney's panicking!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smirked coldly, thinking, "I've got the upper hand now. Of course, Rodney wants me to come out and fight him head-on. But I'm not stupid; why would I do something so foolish?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne acted as if he hadn't heard a thing, calmly cleaning his energy pistol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had been using the energy pistol continuously, and it seemed to have been overworked. The grip was now intensely hot, and Osborne worried it might break.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, his concern was unnecessary. A few minutes later, the grip cooled down and returned to normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems the energy pistol needs a cooldown period after prolonged use. Otherwise, it might malfunction!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is a great weapon. It would be fantastic to get a batch of these! Now that Training Base No. 6 is under my control, with 500 cadets about to graduate, if each of them could be equipped with an energy pistol, their combat power would be terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What a pity! This kind of energy pistol isn't available in even the Draco Group's internal market. I've only ever seen this one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Next time I see the Godfather, I'll ask him about that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne pondered, Rodney continued to shout provocations from afar, trying to lure Osborne out for a fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the emblem on Osborne's chest sent out a signal again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Time to send out another signal? I'd better change my position before they surround me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne prepared to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But suddenly, he felt an overwhelming sense of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, no!"</p><div class="pagination">
