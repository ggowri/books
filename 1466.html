  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne laid eyes on the three Celestial Deity-level Human Community women, bound and displayed as auction pieces, he found himself momentarily stunned, a wave of intense anger surging within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were Celestial Deity warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In any major faction, such warriors were the backbone of their strength, a rare breed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take the Swift family, for example&mdash;the most powerful force in Wild Flame City&mdash;where the number of Celestial Deity warriors barely exceeded ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond them lay the Deity Overlords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, to see Celestial Deity warriors being paraded like this at an auction was nothing short of tragic. It painted a picture of despair that any human would find unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What made it worse was that these three women weren't just any Celestial Deity warriors; they were exceptional talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each possessed a blue Divine Flame and boasted a Level Five Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given time, they had a real shot at becoming Deity Overlords themselves, perhaps even aspiring to the rank of Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here they were, reduced to mere slaves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could see the fury and defiance burning in their eyes. Despite being bound hand and foot and their divine powers suppressed, they glared at the crowd below with icy stares, unyielding and even threatening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if they were silently declaring, "Whoever dares to buy us and treat us as slaves will face our wrath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They refused to submit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the auction hall shifted dramatically, buzzing with excitement and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected to see Celestial Deity-level slaves on the block today, let alone three of them at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was most striking was that these three were not only exceptionally young and beautiful but also possessed talents that far surpass the majority present here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you believe it? Celestial Deity slaves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They don't seem to have accepted their fate yet. They're still wild! If someone buys them, they might turn on their owners. Imagine the damage they could do to a regular faction!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True, if they lash out, it could spell disaster for any clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But their talent is off the charts, and they're stunning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think about it&mdash;bring them home, and you could force them to bear children for our best warriors. The offspring would surely be exceptional!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! They could become breeding machines!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's fists clenched tightly at the cruel chatter echoing around him. Each word stoked the flames of his anger, and he felt an overwhelming urge to drag those vile speakers out and teach them a lesson they wouldn't forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On stage, the three women overheard the degrading remarks, their expressions turning even colder. They fixed their gazes on the one who suggested they could be used as breeding machines, their eyes filled with a hatred that could cut through steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only they could speak, they would have unleashed a torrent of fury right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the auctioneer stepped forward, his voice booming over the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, everyone! As you can see, we have three Human Community female slaves up for auction, all at the Celestial Deity level. Not only are they young and stunningly beautiful, but they also possess extraordinary talent. With proper training, each one of them has a solid chance of becoming a Deity Overlord warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, as you can also see, they are still untamed. Once you bring them home, there's a significant risk they might rebel. It'll be up to you to figure out how to train them to serve you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In any case, you won't find slaves of this caliber again anytime soon! If you can tame them, the rewards will be immense! And let me remind you, we at the slave market have paid a hefty price to acquire them, so their starting bid is high!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scanned the crowd, letting his words sink in. "The opening bid is 20 million Essence Crystals! Each increment must be at least one million! If there are no bids, these women will be sent to other cities for auction. Who knows, your competitors might end up purchasing them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the auctioneer finished, the chatter in the hall erupted once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty million Essence Crystals? For just three slaves? That's outrageous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they are Celestial Deity-level, that starting price is ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, that's way too steep!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they were already trained and guaranteed to obey, I could see 20 million being reasonable. But they're wild and untamed! Who knows how to train them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if they escape? If they rebel, there's no way an average person could hold them back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too expensive! It's just too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the crowd grumbled about the price, a hand shot up from the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Wild Bull Clan bids 21 million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent, all eyes turning to the source of the bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice belonged to a warrior from the Wild Bull Clan, the only Deity Overlord present in the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grinned, an air of confidence radiating from him. "I, Fabian Wolfe, will take these three women! They will become my breeding machines! And as for their wildness, I've always had a thing for fierce women!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
