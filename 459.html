They looked at him in horror and dared not move forward anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne did not spare them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family was in collusion with the Aberrants!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the requirements of his fifth successor test, he had to eliminate all the leaders of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't know who the leaders of the Paltrow family were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it should be enough if he killed all the metahumans above Class B in the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he began the massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy pistol was fired continuously, and energy bullets with terrifying penetrating power poured toward the metahumans of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne would lock every metahuman at Class B and then penetrate them with energy bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they possibly block the energy bullets that even a Class A martial master couldn't block?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's marksmanship demonstrated its power once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each energy bullet could penetrate the head of a metahuman of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shrill screams resounded throughout the Paltrow Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they hid behind cover, they could not escape being shot and killed by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they tried their best to flee far away, they could not escape the attack range of the bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not an ordinary pistol that would lose its accuracy and power hundreds of feet away. This energy pistol was equally powerful even at thousands of feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the last metahuman of the Paltrow family above Class B was shot through the head by Osborne, Osborne finally stopped killing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Alexander and Wade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faces of the two were highly distorted at this moment. Osborne's punches had seriously injured their bodies. They had finally recovered a lot only now. They could only watch Osborne shoot Robert and the metahumans of the Paltrow family one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was hatred in their eyes, as well as fear that could not be concealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that the Paltrow family was doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the metahumans above Class B in the Paltrow family had been killed by Osborne, leaving only the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the two of them couldn't escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and walked towards them step by step, aiming the muzzle of the energy pistol at their heads with cold, murderous intent in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Dylan and Eugen were both stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been in shock ever since Clarissa suddenly took out the Fate Staff and was able to fight against the powerful Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's sudden appearance, saving Clarissa, easily defeating Alexander and Wade, and finally killing all the metahumans of the Paltrow family above Class B, shocked Dylan and Eugen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at each other and saw disbelief in each other's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had thought that Osborne was not worthy of Clarissa at all, so they brought Clarissa from Skyefall to Dampston and wanted to marry Clarissa to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their opinion, Alexander was stronger than Osborne in every aspect. Even if Osborne became the heir of the Augustine family, their thoughts had not changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had thought Osborne was far inferior to Alexander and only Alexander was the most suitable for Clarissa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they had been insisted on marrying Clarissa to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they knew they were wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, they had known they were utterly wrong when Osborne easily defeated Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander was known as the number one genius in Dampston, he was nothing compared to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, both Dylan and Eugen regretted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had known that Osborne was so capable, they would agree to let Clarissa and Osborne be together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they began to worry that Osborne would retaliate against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Osborne walk towards Alexander and Wade step by step, they didn't dare to say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I told you that one of us must die here today! Now, it seems that you will be the one," said Osborne with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was highly embarrassed. Hearing this, he stared at Osborne angrily. "I really regret it! I regret not destroying the Augustine family earlier and not killing you earlier! If I had known that you would grow so fast, I should have taken action earlier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "You regret it? There's no use regretting it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about you beg me? If you do, maybe I will spare your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Alexander was suddenly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was hesitant. He didn't want to die. He was still young, and his life had just begun. He didn't want to die now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are... are you serious?" Alexander gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "You can try it. If you don't beg me, you will die. But if you beg me, at least there is a glimmer of hope. Maybe God will forgive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Alexander gritted his teeth and looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered, "Osborne, I was wrong! Please forgive me. I really know I was wrong! For God's sake, please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately laughed at this scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "Alexander, you are so obedient, just like a dog. You beg me just because I tell you to. You really have no dignity just to survive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But unfortunately, forgiving you is God's business. I'm only responsible for sending you to see God!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
