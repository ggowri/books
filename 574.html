  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you won't move out?" Isaac asked calmly, without a trace of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Larry sneered, "Are you deaf or just stupid? Who do you think you are, telling us to move? You're nothing but insects to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne killed David, and we haven't even settled that score yet. Now you come here trying to provoke us? You're asking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you've got the guts, try taking it by force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll be waiting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac nodded, unfazed. "Alright, I've warned you. If you're not willing to leave, we'll see what happens."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Larry watched him leave, a disdainful smirk on his face, making no effort to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Idiots," he muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young man named Joshua Augustine, in his thirties, approached with a concerned look as he watched Isaac disappear into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, something about this feels off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Larry chuckled, placing a reassuring hand on Joshua's shoulder. "Relax, Joshua. It's just Dampston. The only one among them worth even a second thought is Osborne, and he's no match for us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that David is gone, you're the new heir to Ransford. It's your duty to make sure Dampston pays for what they've done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua nodded, his expression firm. "Don't worry, I'll make sure David is avenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it does seem odd. Why didn't they go after the First Estate or the second one? Why fixate on our estate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Larry laughed coldly. "They don't have the guts to go after the top estates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And there's nothing to worry about. I seriously doubt they have the courage to force us out. But if they do try, we'll hold our ground and make them regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they're foolish enough to start a fight, they'll be the ones who end up destroyed. I'll make sure everyone knows just how powerful Ransford is and how ridiculous Dampston truly is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First place in Branch Bloodline Competition?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They just got lucky. Do they really think that gives them the right to challenge us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're deluding themselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Larry went off to rest, confident that he had nothing to worry about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, word quickly spread among the other branch bloodlines of the Augustine family about how Dampston, despite winning first place, had chosen Third Estate and demanded that Ransford vacate it, only to be flatly refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance, upon hearing the news, sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I actually thought Osborne would go for First Estate and try to push us out. I'm disappointed that he didn't even dare to challenge us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam, who had mostly recovered from his injuries, also heard the news and laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems Osborne isn't completely reckless. He didn't go after First Estate or the second one. If he had, I wouldn't have hesitated to teach him a painful lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even targeting Ransford is a sign that he's overestimating himself. Just because David is gone doesn't mean they can push Ransford around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how strong Osborne thinks he is, he's nothing against the power of Ransford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, let's go enjoy the show!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, Osborne felt the power of the stars slip away, signaling the end of his night of intense cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly closed his Satan's Eye, his gaze now sharper, more focused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night's efforts had significantly strengthened both his body and soul, yet the goal of reaching Class AA still loomed in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daybreak," he muttered to himself. "Time to deal with Ransford."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Descending the stairs, he found Yulissa already bustling around the kitchen, preparing a lavish breakfast. When she saw Osborne, she quickly ran over with a bright smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're done cultivating? Come, breakfast is ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, but his gaze immediately fell to the faint handprint still visible on her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the mark stirred a fresh wave of anger within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gently, he reached out and touched her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa froze, her cheeks flushing crimson, too surprised to move as Osborne's hand lightly caressed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does it still hurt?" he asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head quickly. "No, not anymore! But... are you really going to confront Ransford? They're much stronger than Dampston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile played on Osborne's lips. "Strong or not, they crossed a line when they hurt you. I won't let them get away with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Yulissa's eyes, and without warning, she threw herself into Osborne's arms, holding onto him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not my real brother, but you're even better than one. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily taken aback, but he quickly wrapped his arms around her, gently patting her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, think of me as your brother. Now, go get Zoe and Kendra so we can all have breakfast together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa nodded, hastily wiping away her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the four of them were gathered around the table, enjoying the breakfast Yulissa had prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm coming with you!" Zoe suddenly announced, her eyes burning with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They dared to bully Yulissa, so I'm going to help her get revenge! I'm already at Class B+. I can fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra chimed in, her voice filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm coming too! I might not be able to fight, but I can cheer you on from the sidelines!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
