  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over three hundred blue Miracle Elixirs, but it's still not enough! I'll let Anastasia and Zoe use them first. Meanwhile, I'll head to the other divine peaks to gather more Miracle Elixirs! Once I have enough blue Miracle Elixirs, it'll be time for me to enter seclusion and enhance my elemental essences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne continued to tally his gains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During his expedition at Divine Peak Ten in the South Zone, he didn't just find Miracle Elixirs. He also discovered two Celestial Crystal Mines and extracted every last crystal from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, these two mines combined didn't yield as much as the one he had found at Divine Peak Nine in the East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they produced only a million Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Osborne was more than satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A million Celestial Crystals was no small fortune. Even the Dukedom Level Powers of the Human Community in the West Zone might struggle to come up with that amount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, at the Miracle Elixir auction in the Luminous Commerce Center, the average price for a single red Miracle Elixir was only a hundred Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a million Celestial Crystals, he could buy ten thousand red Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The priciest yellow Miracle Elixirs averaged around five thousand each, meaning he could snag two hundred of those.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overall, while the value of a million Celestial Crystals didn't quite match the value of the sixteen hundred Miracle Elixirs he had gathered, it was still a massive windfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he finished counting his spoils, Osborne felt a sense of accomplishment and set off again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His next target was Divine Peak Nine in the South Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After more than a day, Osborne emerged from Divine Peak Nine, and upon reviewing his haul, he found it was similar to the last, but with a bit more Celestial Crystals&mdash;two million this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad! Keep it coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His pace in gathering from the divine peaks was picking up, and he was getting faster. Osborne initially thought it would take him nearly a month to scour all ten divine peaks in the South Zone, but he was pleasantly surprised to find that he had wrapped it up in under twenty days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had nearly cleaned out all the Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals within 120 thousand miles of the ten divine peaks in the South Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gains were monumental!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Eighteen thousand two hundred Miracle Elixirs in total!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Among them, there are fourteen hundred yellow Miracle Elixirs, two thousand five hundred blue Miracle Elixirs, and three thousand two hundred black Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rest, over ten thousand, are white and red Miracle Elixirs, which I've handed over to the Blood Demon members for their breakthroughs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, more than five thousand of them have broken through to the Deity King level! And this is just from the South Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next, it's time to raid the East Zone! Besides Divine Peak Nine, there are nine more peaks waiting for me! The haul shouldn't be much less than what I gathered here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and I've got nineteen million Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grin spread across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that I've got over two thousand five hundred blue Miracle Elixirs, even though Anastasia and Zoe have been using them up, I still have nearly two thousand left. It's time for me to take a breather and enter seclusion for a while to boost my elemental essences! Once my elemental essence level increases, I'll be able to scour the divine peaks even faster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stepped into the Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy concentration in Hope Haven was even higher than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't disturb Anastasia and the others who were in seclusion. Instead, he took a thousand Blue Miracle Elixirs and entered a state of focused meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One thousand blue Miracle Elixirs should be enough to push my space, dark, and lightning elemental essences up to Level Nine, right? Let's get started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately immersed himself in his training. One by one, the precious blue Miracle Elixirs transformed into pure, unique energy that flowed into his body. His space, dark, and lightning elemental essences began to devour this energy voraciously, becoming incredibly active as they surged toward Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the leap from the peak of Level Eight to Level Nine was proving to be an uphill battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each blue Miracle Elixir consumed, Osborne could feel his elemental essences teetering on the edge of Level Nine, yet they just wouldn't break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time slipped away quickly in this relentless pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the days turned into months and months into years, Osborne continued to consume the blue Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After two long years, when he was nearly down to his last few elixirs, a significant change finally began to manifest in his elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first to transform was his dark power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pinnacle of Level Eight dark power was finally undergoing a metamorphosis. Waves of terrifying dark energy erupted around Osborne, swirling and crashing like a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the sky above Hope Haven darkened, cloaked in ominous clouds of energy that sent chills down the spines of anyone nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others who were in seclusion felt the shift and abruptly awakened, their expressions shifting to shock as they turned to the source of the disturbance&mdash;Osborne's seclusion chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne heard a faint crack, like the sound of glass shattering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dark elemental essence had finally broken through!</span></p><div class="pagination">
