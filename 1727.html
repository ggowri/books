  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul's face was etched with serious concern. He mused, "I'd rather believe it's true than risk thinking otherwise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If what Hannah says is real and I do nothing, I'd be the greatest traitor to the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City</span><span>, </span><span>and to the Gellar family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought weighing heavily on him, Raoul clenched his jaw. "Hannah, you need to gather everyone in the Gellar family immediately and get them into your Dimensional Microcosm! I'll issue the orders to ensure they cooperate with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the other factions of the Mystic Feather Clan, convincing them might be a challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They probably won't take me seriously. But I'll do my best; beyond that, it's in fate's hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting another moment, Raoul rushed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah let out a sigh of relief, knowing at least the Gellar family would be safe. Now, it was up to her grandfather to persuade the other factions of the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Gellar family, numbering over ten thousand, was left bewildered by the sudden orders. They had no idea what was happening but quickly gathered their important belongings and made their way to the designated assembly point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Hannah appeared before them, she commanded their attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, you need to enter my Dimensional Microcosm right now! Settle in there for the time being! I know you're all curious, but there's no time for explanations. Just understand that the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City is facing a life-or-death crisis. Once we get through this, I promise someone will explain everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Hannah activated the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dark dimensional portal opened, and the Gellar family members exchanged uncertain glances, but they quickly complied, forming a line and stepping through one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, all the members of the Gellar family had found refuge in the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah felt a wave of relief wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how things are going with Grandpa. I need to check on him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined flash, Hannah vanished, leaving the Gellar family's residence in an eerie silence devoid of any presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the center of the floating mountain, a massive structure housed the leaders of various factions within the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged puzzled glances as they looked at Raoul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them asked, "Raoul, why did you ring the Mystic Feather Clock?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you know that the Mystic Feather Clock is only sounded when Wild Flame City's Mystic Feather Clan faces a grave crisis?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything seems fine in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why the alarm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speaker was Maxime Lopez, the head of the largest faction within the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Deity King warrior himself, he was nearing mid-stage status and was considered one of the strongest in the clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul had a long-standing rivalry with Maxime. Both had been prodigies in their youth, vying for supremacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their competition had been fierce, fueled by their mutual affection for the same woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxime had triumphed in strength, but Raoul had won the heart of the woman, who was none other than Hannah's grandmother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This history had only intensified their rivalry, and they had been at odds ever since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, Raoul had no time for old grudges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the leaders gathered, he took a deep breath and addressed them directly, "The reason I rang the Mystic Feather Clock is that our Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame </span><span>City is on the brink of a catastrophe that could lead to our annihilation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hung in the air, and the room fell silent as the gravity of his statement sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxime couldn't help but scoff, "Raoul, have you lost your mind? You're saying the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City is about to face an extinction-level catastrophe? What on earth are you talking about? Are you getting too old and losing your grip on reality?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxime's mocking tone made Raoul's brow furrow deeper, a nagging sense of dread creeping into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, those factions that were closer to Maxime chimed in as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously, Raoul, what kind of joke is this?" one voice called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Mystic Feather Clan is growing stronger by the day. Where's this danger you're talking about? What catastrophe?" another added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your game here?" someone else questioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Raoul shouted, his voice cutting through the chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly recounted everything Hannah had told him, his urgency palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, the room fell into an uneasy silence, everyone momentarily taken aback by the gravity of his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it didn't take long for Maxime to erupt into laughter. "Oh, Raoul, you really are getting old! Your mind is slipping! We may not have the best relationship with the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan, but we've never been enemies! And the Bowman family? They have no reason to want us gone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think they're teaming up to wipe us out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You expect us to believe that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's downright ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bowman family is too high and mighty to bother with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted around the room, the leaders exchanging incredulous glances as they mocked Raoul's claims.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul sighed heavily, feeling the weight of their disbelief. He had anticipated this reaction, and it left him feeling drained and powerless.</span></p><div class="pagination">
