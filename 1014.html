  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked, momentarily stunned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, what did you just say? It belongs to Anastasia herself? She cultivated them on her own? That's impossible! When I found her, she was just five years old!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ever since then, she's been with me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She never trained, not even before she fell ill, she didn't know the world had metahumans! How could she possibly cultivate such formidable energy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa gave a casual smile. "You don't trust your woman, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he trusted Isa, but this time, her words were almost unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa explained, "You misunderstood me! I said her body is special! She indeed didn't </span><span>actively train, but as long as she's alive, she's essentially training!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be precise... she's not entirely human!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not human?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dumbfounded again, finding Isa's words increasingly absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How could Anastasia not be human?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, too, was left speechless, staring at Isa in disbelief, wondering if Isa had been drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Anastasia is not human?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I'm her twin sister, does that mean I'm not human either?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe looked down at her own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm human! Definitely a human!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa chuckled. "Let me be clear to avoid any wild speculations. What I mean is, she's not from this Blue Planet! Her body is different from Earthlings; she doesn't need to train. Her energy would rapidly increase just by being alive. By adulthood, she'll at least reach Class AAA!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne was even more stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not an Earthling, so she's an alien?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head, her expression turning serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alien? You could say that, but it's not accurate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, she comes from a destroyed and sealed realm&mdash;</span><span>Celestara</span><span>! She's a human born of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shaken to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia from </span><span>Celestara</span><span>? A human born of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa swiftly continued, "Remember what I told you before? A long, long time ago, </span><span>Celestara</span><span> was invaded by extraterrestrial Dark Deities. The powerful Lord Malevolence, leading countless Dark Deities, shattered </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, obliterating it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though the Seven Deity Kings eventually injured him and sealed him, </span><span>Celestara</span><span> was destroyed, filled with a thick death scent, making it nearly impossible to give birth to intelligent life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the Seven Deity Kings joined forces to seal the immense </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, leaving only a small portion, cleansing it of the death scent to serve as a breeding ground for intelligent life to develop!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This breeding ground is none other than Blue Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blue Planet is a tiny fraction of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. Even though </span><span>Celestara</span><span> is sealed, it doesn't mean it can't give birth to intelligent life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, due to the harsh environment of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, filled with deadly death scent, intelligent life born there is far more powerful, as the weak have been naturally selected out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa pointed at Anastasia, adding, "She's an intelligent life born of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, a </span><span>Celestara</span><span> human! Her body structure is 99% identical to Earthlings, except for the extra crystal in her brain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This crystal, unique to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> humans, is called the Crystal of Life. Its function is to filter the death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Crystal of Life, they can survive in the death-scented environment of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> without being corroded or enchanted by the death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Celestara</span><span> humans, once they reach adulthood, typically possess strength comparable to a Class A master, at the very least. Talented individuals might reach Class AA or even surpass that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before, perhaps due to the environment of Blue Planet, constrained by its rules, her power didn't manifest. It only erupted now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can feel her brain yourself; see if you can detect the Crystal of Life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was now utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Isa claims Anastasia isn't an Earthling but a </span><span>Celestara</span><span> human?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That she has a crystal in her brain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Crystal of Life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't believe it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached Anastasia, placing his hand on her head, and carefully sensed her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne was left dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really did feel a crimson crystal in Anastasia's mind, pulsating with immense vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Crystal of Life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Isa in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa simply smiled, "Now you believe me, don't you? I once followed my teacher to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> and saw </span><span>Celestara</span><span> humans. So, I'm quite sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Isa turned her gaze to Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, come here and let me check your body. Since you two are twin sisters, if she's from </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, so should you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
