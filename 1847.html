  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged with a smirk. "Think what you want! All I know is you haven't bought a single Miracle Elixir yet, while I've snatched up four!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you say you were going to buy every Miracle Elixir today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How laughable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're broke, don't go boasting. It just makes you look foolish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne shot Kurt another disdainful look, effortlessly brushing aside the mention of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Kurt's anger flared again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt sneered, saying, "Why are you so eager? Those four red Miracle Elixirs are the cheapest in the bunch! There are still six more to go. If you're so bold, keep bidding! I don't believe you'll dare to raise your offer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Kurt sank back into his seat, choosing to ignore Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until he secured a Miracle Elixir, he had no solid way to counter Osborne's taunts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only suppress his rage, vowing to get his revenge later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auctioneer at the Luminous Commerce Center cleared his throat. "Next up for bidding is the blue Miracle Elixir! There are only two available, and they significantly enhance elemental essence! Anyone looking to boost their elemental essence shouldn't miss this opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The starting bid is four hundred Celestial Crystals. Let the bidding begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the auctioneer finished, Kurt shot his hand up. "I'll bid five hundred Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blue Miracle Elixir was crucial for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reaching the Deity King level, advancing in rank was relatively easier compared to enhancing elemental essence, which required immense understanding and a lot of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Improving elemental essence had a direct impact on one's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most challenging aspect to advance was the Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Kurt didn't care much for the red Miracle Elixirs, he was determined to secure the blue Miracle Elixir and the yellow one that boosted the Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot a cold glance at Osborne, feeling a twinge of worry that Osborne might pull another reckless bidding stunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Osborne remained silent for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised to see the starting price for the blue Miracle Elixir was five times higher than the red one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really that valuable? Elemental essence is harder to enhance than rank, which could explain why the blue Miracle Elixir costs more than the red one. Even I could use a blue Miracle Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five hundred Celestial Crystals, going once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there a higher bid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five hundred Celestial Crystals, going twice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five hundred Celestial Crystals, going th..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the auctioneer prepared to bring down the gavel, a smug grin spread across Kurt's face. He suspected Osborne was out of Celestial Crystals. After all, Osborne had already spent two thousand. Surely, he had to be running low by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne snapped back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly raised his bidding paddle, his voice calm yet firm. "Hold on! I'll bid one thousand Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot Kurt a look of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Baxter, you think you can snag a blue Miracle Elixir for just five hundred Celestial Crystals? Dream on! When I'm here, don't expect to buy a Miracle Elixir at a normal price! Of course, if you're willing to raise your offer tenfold, I might consider letting you have one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was one of mock benevolence, as if he were doing Kurt a favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's fists clenched tightly, his face reddening with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was practically seething. "Five hundred Celestial Crystals is the standard price for a blue Miracle Elixir!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy has the audacity to say I can't buy it at a normal price? Unless I'm ready to pay ten times more, he won't even let me have one?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he trying to humiliate me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt glared daggers at Osborne, a murderous rage bubbling up inside him. If it weren't for the presence of the Supernal Deity King from the Luminous Commerce Center nearby, he would have already lunged at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's voice trembled with anger. "Fine, fine, you win!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A thousand Celestial Crystals for the blue Miracle Elixir, right? You must be dreaming! I'll go up to eleven hundred!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can't get the Miracle Elixir, neither will you! I'll see how much Celestial Crystal you're willing to waste at such a price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled smugly, "That's none of your business! I'll offer fifteen hundred!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne shot Kurt a disdainful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt had no idea how many Celestial Crystals Osborne possessed. In the mines of the Divine Peak Nine, Osborne had amassed over five million Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had spent a good deal, he still had more than two million left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spending a few thousand on Miracle Elixirs was nothing to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt hesitated, ultimately deciding not to raise his bid. He was worried that Osborne might suddenly back out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, spending over fifteen hundred Celestial Crystals on the blue Miracle Elixir was something only a fool would do!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the auction continued, Kurt's expression grew increasingly grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snapped up the second blue Miracle Elixir for fifteen hundred Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next came the black Miracle Elixir, which enhanced one's soul and insight&mdash;always a favorite of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly bid fifteen hundred Celestial Crystals and secured it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, out of the ten Miracle Elixirs, the extravagant Osborne had already bought seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only three remained&mdash;two white Miracle Elixirs, known for their healing properties, and one yellow Miracle Elixir, which could enhance the Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the most valuable of the lot.</span></p><div class="pagination">
