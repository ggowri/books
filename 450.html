  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan anxiously said, "Mr. Paltrow, don't act impulsively. I will convince Clarissa to go through with the wedding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he desperately gestured to Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Clarissa didn't even look at him. She focused solely on Alexander and said calmly, "Go ahead. I will not marry you. Today, either he comes to take me away, or I leave my body behind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Clarissa's face showed determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her resolute expression, and his anger boiled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Clarissa should be my wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she would rather die than marry me just because of Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Alexander jealous. He twisted his face as he coldly said, "Osborne cannot come to take you away, and you won't die either. With me here, you won't even have the chance to die. You can only lie in my bed and offer up your fate power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Alexander took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out, and suddenly, countless small snakes of lightning appeared on his palm, thrashing wildly. Dylan and Eugen felt their hair stand on end as they sensed a terrifying surge of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions changed, clearly shocked. "Alexander's power is so strong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "Now I'll numb your body, so you will complete the wedding with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His figure instantly appeared in front of Clarissa, pressing the horde of lightning snakes against her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his precise control, the lightning wouldn't harm Clarissa but was enough to paralyze her, leaving her unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's expression changed dramatically. She could clearly feel that Alexander's attack was much stronger than Eugen's. Without any hesitation, she activated the Divine and Demonic Wings, wrapping herself in them for protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this useful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Alexander's hand, surrounded by the lightning snakes, pressed against her wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a loud crackling of electricity rang out, and Clarissa felt a terrifying power of lightning that penetrated the defense of her Divine and Demonic Wings and struck her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, her body began to go numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have considerable strength, but unfortunately, the gap in our realms is too wide. You can't block my attack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, the lightning on Alexander's hands became more violent and powerful, completely breaking through the defense of the Divine and Demonic Wings, numbing Clarissa's body further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa panicked, her body rendered completely immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked disdainfully. "I told you, you won't die. Now, come with me to complete the wedding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander reached for Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dreaming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa shouted loudly, and a sacred white light enveloped her, lifting the paralysis from her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Divine and Demonic Wings moved swiftly, slicing toward Alexander's neck like two sharp blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression changed as he stepped back to avoid the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Clarissa in shock. "You can actually dispel the effects of paralysis? This must be your second type of energy, divine healing, right? I heard your divine healing can even bring back the recently deceased. It's something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm even more interested in you. I must make you my woman. Your divine healing will only serve me from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Alexander attacked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the lightning snakes in his hands became even more terrifying and powerful. The snakes coalesced into a sphere, resembling a prison of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand, and the lightning prison descended upon Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa gritted her teeth, her wings flapping fiercely, trying to shatter the prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her strength was only Class B+, creating an insurmountable gap compared to Alexander's power. Even the miraculous Divine and Demonic Wings couldn't withstand such overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning prison enveloped Clarissa's body, and no matter how fiercely the Divine and Demonic Wings struggled, it couldn't break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shrank the lightning prison down, his expression icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop struggling, and you'll suffer less pain. Otherwise, with the lightning upon you, you will regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, thinking, "Is it still not enough?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I've been desperately refining myself and improving my strength during this time, I still can't do it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is it so difficult to fight against fate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, where are you? Why haven't you appeared yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can barely hold on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various thoughts flashed through Clarissa's mind. She looked at Alexander's triumphant and arrogant face with nothing but disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the range of the lightning prison grew smaller, Clarissa took a deep breath, her gaze turning resolute as if she had made a decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her hand and, in a tone filled with utmost reverence, whispered, "Come forth, my Fate Staff."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the void shook violently, and the lightning prison surrounding Clarissa seemed unable to withstand the tremors, crumbling in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brilliantly radiant staff materialized in Clarissa's raised hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the Fate Staff, a divine artifact.</span></p><div class="pagination">
