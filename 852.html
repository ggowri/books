  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne emerged from the dungeon, cradling Kendra and Yulissa in his arms.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The scenes of God of Star wielding Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays continued to flash in his mind, leaving him deeply shaken.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne pondered, "Is this what divine power looks like?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With God of Star's strength, if he unleashed Destruction Orbs, he could easily annihilate an entire city! Anyone within the area covered by the orbs would be doomed, and even I would be helpless against them! Even the highest-ranking Class S Lesser Gods would likely fall.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is what divinity means? And how many gods like God of Star are there? He once mentioned that during the Age of Gods, he was just an ordinary god. There must be many more like him!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And how many Dark Deities like Mosley are out there?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shuddered, shaking his head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew better than to dwell on such thoughts. For now, he was only Class AAA, and matters concerning the ancient gods and Dark Deities were beyond his current scope.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What mattered was to continue improving his strength, await his Honor Quest Ceremony, defeat everyone there, and pass Sebastian's test.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he would set out to find his parents.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you found them?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan and the others gathered around, their faces filled with concern as they looked at the unconscious Kendra and Yulissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne snapped back to the present and nodded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. They're fine&mdash;just poisoned. They'll wake up soon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's head back."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne carried the two women to their quarters.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Dampston branch bloodline of the Augustine family had already moved from Mount Seven's Third Estate to the First Estate at the summit. This move was requested by Marce's branch, given that Osborne was now the primary heir of the Augustine family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his elevated status, Marce's branch bloodline couldn't afford to offend them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After laying Kendra and Yulissa on the bed, Osborne turned to Queenie.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take good care of them and let me know if anything happens."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie nodded firmly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stepping out of the room, Osborne found Caleb waiting in the living room.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb asked, his face etched with worry, "Osborne, what's going on?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did they end up in the dungeon? Is there a secret passage between Arena Number One and the dungeon?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shook his head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't planning to share details about God of Star or Dark Deity Mosley with Caleb. With Caleb's current strength, knowing this information would only add to his stress.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not sure of the specifics. Maybe it was just a spatial anomaly," Osborne explained.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb nodded, though he remained troubled.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He seemed to wrestle with something on his mind, opening his mouth a few times as if to speak, but he ultimately kept his thoughts to himself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Caleb Augustine, if you have something to say, just say it," Osborne said, sensing Caleb's unease.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb sighed, "There's nothing else to discuss, really. I just wanted to check in on how you're preparing for the Honor Quest Ceremony in two weeks. The invitations have already gone out, and soon, all the major superpowers will be arriving.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, are you confident? There's a lot of concern among the higher-ups of the Augustine family. They're worried that your Honor Quest Ceremony might turn into a public embarrassment."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled calmly, "Mr. Caleb Augustine, I've been preparing for this all along.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. I can't guarantee how far I'll go or how many victories I'll rack up, but I promise it won't be a disgrace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, I need to retreat and focus on improving my strength.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please handle the arrangements for the Honor Quest Ceremony. I'll emerge before it begins!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without giving Caleb a chance to respond, Osborne tore open a dimensional rift and stepped through.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was heading to a secure location for his seclusion&mdash;the Augustine family's dungeon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was the perfect place for uninterrupted training.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Osborne had any questions, he could always consult the God of Star. What seemed like a complex issue for Osborne might be resolved with just a few words from God of Star.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Osborne arrived in the dungeon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite his severe injuries, God of Star nodded in acknowledgment as Osborne entered.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finding a quiet corner, Osborne began his rigorous training regimen.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne set ambitious goals for himself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the next two weeks, he aimed to master Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays, elevate Thunder Realm, Spatial Domain, and Spirit Realm to Level Two, and, most crucially, perfect Explosive Force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With these achievements, he would stand a slim chance against the formidable Isa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's get started!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne wasted no time and swiftly entered a deep state of training.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he plunged into his training, news of his Honor Quest Ceremony began to spread rapidly around the globe, sending shockwaves throughout the world.</p><div class="pagination">
