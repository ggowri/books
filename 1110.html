  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce had always wondered where Osborne had managed to gather so many Class AAA and even Class S Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, training a single Class AAA warrior was a difficult task!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at its peak, Bryce's pirate crew could barely field more than a hundred Class AAA warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he watched in astonishment as six hundred Blood Demon members effortlessly broke through to Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It left him completely stunned!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could hardly believe his eyes, thinking that everything he was witnessing must be an illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea that these warriors could advance to Class S so easily was beyond anything he had ever imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce considered himself a prodigy, yet he had been stuck at Class S for over a decade. To break through, he had even given away the Trident of Poseidon to Clarissa in a desperate attempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Bryce felt as though his years of hard training had all been in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson, don't be so surprised!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their bodies are unique; as long as they have enough blood energy, breaking through to Class S is not too difficult for them. Still, even after breaking through, their individual strength won't compare to yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce rolled his eyes at Osborne's comment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so stunned he could hardly speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One Blood Demon Class S warrior might not be as strong as he was, but if ten or twenty of them surrounded him, even he would be doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, standing before him were a thousand Class S Blood Demon members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This force of a thousand Class S Blood Demon warriors could easily overwhelm ninety-nine percent of the world's superpowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can the Aberrants possibly withstand this?" Bryce thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found himself almost pitying the Aberrants at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne commanded, his voice ice-cold, "Wipe out the Aberrants! Capture Gerardo alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to tear him limb from limb!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, Osborne led the group in another series of interdimensional travels, quickly covering the remaining 120 miles to reach the Aberrants' stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It appeared to be an ordinary mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew that this mountain had been hollowed out, transformed into the Aberrants' hidden base, a Gerardo's meticulously built kingdom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, there were at least a thousand Class S clones and numerous Human Slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any superpower that dared to attack this stronghold would likely face devastating losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Osborne looked at the thousand Class S Blood Demon members behind him, he felt a surge of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, we will utterly destroy the Aberrants' stronghold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members, brimming with fighting spirit, launched their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They unleashed their powerful attacks on the mountain. Though the Aberrants had heavily fortified it, the mountain could not withstand the combined assault of a thousand Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, the mountain crumbled and shattered, revealing a deep tunnel within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the Class S clones of the Aberrants emerged from within, attempting to mount a defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Osborne's command, the Blood Demon members split into ten battle squads, each charging towards the clones, eliminating every opponent in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson, it's your turn to fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After today, the Aberrants will be no more! If you don't act now, you'll miss your chance for revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's eyes blazed with fury as he heard Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded, his expression filled with determination. "Osborne, make sure to leave Gerardo alive! I want to see him ground to dust! I want to witness his agony as he dies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a firm nod in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Bryce gripped the Trident of Poseidon and charged into the fray, unleashing his rage upon the enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As more and more Class S clones appeared, it became clear that despite their numbers, they were no match for the Blood Demon members in terms of strength or coordination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, it wouldn't be long before they were all annihilated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The countdown to the Aberrants' demise had begun!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't planning to wait there idly, and his true target had always been Gerardo!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was a spatial metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he realized he was losing, he might use his spatial abilities to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no intention of giving him that chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see where you're hiding!" Osborne muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, he vanished from his position, using interdimensional travel to enter the depths of the Aberrants' stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, everything was eerily quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the clones and Human Slaves had rushed out to engage the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began to sense Gerardo's location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't detect anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, Osborne muttered, "Could Gerardo have already escaped? He did say he'd come back to merge with more corpses of gods and then seek revenge against me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, he's undoubtedly desperately trying to merge with those corpses. And since those corpses were discovered here, they won't be easy to transport. They're his only hope for turning the tables, so he must still be here. He hasn't fled yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold snort and continued his search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was certain that Gerardo was attempting to fuse with the corpse of the third god and that if he could locate the place where the corpses were stored, he would find Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The base was vast, but Osborne was methodical in his search, confident that he would eventually uncover Gerardo's whereabouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's guess was spot on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was indeed still there, hiding in the deepest part of the stronghold, within the massive chamber that stored the corpses of gods!</span></p><div class="pagination">
