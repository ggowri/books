  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth was the first to notice the changes in his body. Previously, because he had used the Hudson family's deadly forbidden technique, his body had turned into something like a leaky funnel. Even if he did nothing, his vitality would drain uncontrollably until there was nothing left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he realized his vitality was no longer leaking. The "funnel" that was his body had been repaired. His once-empty frame was now brimming with immense vitality, and not a single drop was slipping away. For the first time in a long while, he felt powerful again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth's face lit up with a mix of excitement and relief. After all, if given the choice, who wouldn't prefer to live?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Seth had handed the white Miracle Elixir to Virgil because Virgil was his nephew, the Hudson family's most talented young member, and the heir to their legacy. Seth believed Virgil's survival mattered more than his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that Seth wanted to die&mdash;he simply had no choice but to face death for the sake of the Hudson family. But now, the sheer joy of being alive overwhelmed him. "I'm fine. My body is healed. I've recovered," he murmured, his voice trembling with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soft sound of Seth's murmurs sent a wave of excitement through the crowd outside. They could feel it clearly&mdash;his vitality had stopped draining. At that moment, everyone's eyes turned red with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan burst through the door and threw his arms around Seth, sobbing loudly. The others were wiping at their eyes, trying to hold back their emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you crying for? A grown man bawling like a child&mdash;have some dignity!" Seth barked at Tristan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Tristan didn't care in the slightest. Compared to the despair of losing his father, hearing his father's firm, chastising voice again felt like the greatest blessing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, stop crying," Seth grumbled, shoving Tristan away half-heartedly. Then, he turned to Osborne, his expression full of gratitude and emotion. "Osborne, thank you for saving me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Seth said that, the others finally snapped out of their daze. Immediately, they swarmed around Osborne, thanking both him and Hannah repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some time, Zachary seriously asked, "How did you do it, Osborne? I mean, how did you stop Seth's vitality from leaking? His condition is something we've seen far too often in the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our family's deadly forbidden technique may be immensely powerful, but it comes with devastating consequences. After using it, the body suffers irreversible damage, causing vitality to continuously drain away until death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No medical treatment has ever worked. Only the white Miracle Elixir has the power to repair this damage. Over the years, as the wars with the Dark Deity Legion along the borders have intensified, more and more members of our family have had no choice but to use the deadly forbidden technique. But the white Miracle Elixir is far too rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most of our family members who use the deadly forbidden technique are left with no choice but to wait quietly for death. Our family has lost too many people this way..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Zachary spoke to this point, his expression grew unbearably heavy and filled with pain. The others wore the same look of sorrow and anguish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community in the West Zone knew well that the Hudson family had fallen into decline in recent years. It all traced back to the heavy losses they had suffered on the border battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large portion of those losses stemmed from members like Seth, who had used the Hudson family's deadly forbidden technique. The aftermath was devastating; the uncontrollable loss of vitality inevitably led to their deaths. Even now, many in the Hudson family, like Seth, were lying on their deathbeds, waiting for the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's voice turned grave as he said, "Osborne, how did you manage to heal Seth without using the white Miracle Elixir? Is this treatment something that can be made widely available? It's incredibly important to the Hudson family." As he finished speaking, his gaze fixed on Osborne with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others also turned their expectant eyes to Osborne, equally curious about how he had managed to save Seth. If this method could be made accessible, countless people in the Hudson family, who were currently waiting to die, might have a chance at survival. At this moment, everyone looked at Osborne, their eyes filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke up, "I can't fully explain how I healed Uncle Seth. Unfortunately, this method can't be generalized. But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His initial words brought a wave of disappointment across the room. But as soon as he hinted at a twist, everyone's hope reignited. "But what?" someone urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "But for me, this treatment is very simple. As long as the patient is brought before me, I can heal them quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he finished speaking, Zachary and the others lit up with joy and excitement. "Really?" Zachary's voice trembled with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile. The reason he was able to heal Seth was due to the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. He didn't fully understand the mechanics behind it, but for the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, injuries like Seth's were trivial. Moreover, it didn't even require any effort from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne's confirmation, everyone was overcome with excitement. "There's hope! Everyone has hope now! Quick! Gather all those who've used the deadly forbidden technique and are still alive. They can all be saved!" Zachary shouted in exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room erupted into action, with people hurrying off, their faces alight with joy. Osborne, however, found himself growing increasingly intrigued by the Hudson family's deadly forbidden technique.</span></p><div class="pagination">
