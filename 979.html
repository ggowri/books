  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Greyson's authoritative voice echoed in the air, the members of the Lambert family snapped back to reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the shock still coursing through their veins, they hurriedly bowed to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One after another, they murmured in unison, "Greetings, Godfather!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne blinked in surprise, rubbing his nose awkwardly. "Please, no need for all this formality. You're my elders; just call me by my name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Greyson looked at Osborne, his eyes wide with disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just a short while ago, he had felt a twinge of disappointment over the Augustine family's choice to send only this young man to assist them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought Osborne was far too inexperienced to tackle the issues facing the Lambert family despite Osborne's evident talent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Greyson had even been mildly rude, believing that the Augustine family's decision to send Osborne alone indicated a lack of regard for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then came the unexpected call from Wesson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson had informed him that Sebastian, the former head of the Augustine family, had stepped down, and Osborne had ascended to take his place. Even more startling was the fact that both the Draco Group and the Godfather's scepter had been handed over to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, Osborne was now the new Godfather!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Greyson was utterly stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew Wesson wouldn't mislead him, so he swiftly turned around and bowed sincerely to Osborne, acknowledging that, in terms of status, Osborne was now above him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Godfather, respect must be maintained!" Greyson emphasized, forcing down his shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sighed, "Mr. Greyson Lambert, I'm just a junior. It feels odd for you to call me Godfather; just call me by my name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Greyson shook his head firmly. "That won't do! You've inherited the title of Godfather, which makes you the king of the Rosmandi underworld! The Lambert family may be a Secluded Family, but we are part of the Rosmandi underground world. We owe you the respect you deserve, regardless of your age."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, he turned to address the rest of the Lambert family, "This time, the Godfather himself has come to support us&mdash;we're saved!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The family members exchanged excited glances, their relief palpable on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet deep down, they couldn't help but feel a sigh escape their lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Osborne had become the Godfather, his strength was still only Class AAA. If the former Godfather had come, perhaps there would be hope; with Osborne, however, the chance was slim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one truly believed he could save the Lambert family from their predicament.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Godfather, please come in," Greyson said, his voice filled with courtesy as he gestured for Osborne to enter the cabin, deliberately falling half a step behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne realized he couldn't change Greyson's mind, he shrugged and stepped inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside was a conference room, and Greyson insisted that Osborne sit at the center of the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how much Osborne pushed back, he ultimately conceded to Greyson's insistence, feeling the weight of Godfather's power wash over him for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once everyone was seated, Osborne quickly inquired, "Mr. Greyson Lambert, what's the current situation of the Lambert family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Greyson frowned, his expression grave. "Godfather, we're immensely grateful for your presence, especially at such a critical time! But I must stress that our situation is dire!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eityreia Organization, they..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Greyson could finish, a chilling scream echoed from afar, instantly draining the color from the faces of the Lambert family members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh no! Another family member has been attacked!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Quick, we need to help!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, all of them&mdash;Greyson included&mdash;sprinted out of the cabin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression darkened as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a swift motion, he tore open a dimensional rift, stepping through it and reappearing hundreds of yards away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The chilling scream had originated from that very spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Here in the outskirts of the Lambert family's territory, Osborne had barely arrived when his eyes fell upon a young woman, desperately clutching at her throat. Blood gushed through her trembling fingers, staining her clothes a deep red. Terror filled her eyes, a haunting panic that radiated from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her gaze, filled with both anger and fear, was fixed on something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He followed her line of sight and, in an instant, caught a glimpse of a figure slipping away into the shadows. Even with the power of Satan's Eye activated, he couldn't track where that person had gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just that fleeting moment was enough for him to recognize the silhouette.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Scarlett!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt his heart race. He knew well enough that Scarlett's stealth tactics were almost impossible to detect, even for him, without the Realm activated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that she had vanished, he couldn't tell if she was gone for good or hiding right around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tension rippled through his body as he switched to the Light Realm, ensuring that Scarlett was indeed out of reach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A frown creased his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne muttered, frustration lacing his voice, "Damn it, you're a fast one!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, I'd make you pay for this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that whispered threat, his focus shifted back to the woman whose throat had been slit by Scarlett's blade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her injuries were catastrophic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In any other circumstance, she would be destined for death&mdash;no skillful doctor could save her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But fate seemed to have played a hand in her luck; she had come across Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Light of Redemption!"</p><div class="pagination">
