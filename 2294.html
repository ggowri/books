  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, everyone trailed Rupert out of the Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they escaped that brutal environment, a collective sigh of relief swept through the group. Even though the world around them was still buried under a thick layer of snow and ice, and the bone-chilling cold still nipped at their skin, it felt like a slice of heaven compared to what they'd endured inside the chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd never imagined that a frozen, snow-covered landscape could feel so darn cozy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could have their druthers, they'd never set foot in the Arctic Maw Chasm again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, well, that was where the state duel was going down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bright and early tomorrow, they'd have to plunge back into its depths, on the hunt for tokens, ready to fight until the ten mightiest warriors were selected to represent Zephyr State in the whole Eastern Zone 3's zone duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next seven days were going to be spent holed up in the Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, head back now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get some shut-eye! Once the state duel kicks off tomorrow, you probably won't get a moment's peace. If you want to come out of the state duel with something to brag about, you gotta roll up your sleeves and fight harder than the rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words ringing in their ears, Rupert shepherded everyone back to the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thousand participants scattered like leaves in the wind, each making their way back to their own digs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also made a beeline for his courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All along the way, folks were still chewing the fat about what they'd seen in the Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good gravy! What a mind-blower today was! I'd only heard tales about the Arctic Maw Chasm before. I knew the environment in there was rough as a cob, like a no-go zone, but I'd never laid eyes on it myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seeing it for real today, I realized those stories weren't just hot air! And we only scratched the surface above the sixth layer! I've heard it's a whole lot scarier below the sixth layer. Supposedly, a bunch of Empyrean Sacredness warriors have bought the farm in there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, the conditions there are tougher than old boots! I've made up my mind. I'm only gonna stick to the top three layers. There's no way I'm going below the fourth layer. I'd be a goner before I even knew what hit me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm with you on that. I'm staying in the top three layers, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can tough it out in the fourth layer for a few hours. I'll be shuttling back and forth between the third and fourth layers! The tokens in the fourth layer are a whole lot more valuable. Finding one token in the fourth layer is like hitting the jackpot compared to finding ten in the third layer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count me in on that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm green with envy for those who can stay in the fourth layer for ages! And those who can operate in the fifth and sixth layers for long stretches, their scores are gonna leave ours in the dust!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No point in being jealous. That's just the difference in strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, there are only about a dozen folks who can really make a long-term go of it in the sixth layer. The rest can only last a few hours at best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And there are only around a hundred who can stick it out in the fifth layer for a good while!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid all this banter, Osborne made his way back to his Courtyard 8 in Zone One. Clara tagged along behind him, itching to hash out some strategies for the state duel tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shut the courtyard gate behind him and turned to face Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara didn't beat around the bush. "Osborne, I can't hang in the fourth layer for long. I can barely last six hours tops! So, I've made up my mind. I'll bounce between the fourth and third layers to hunt for tokens. Once I find them, I won't register them right away. I'll hold onto them until I meet up with you, then hand them over for you to register. That way, the points will go straight to your score!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Clara, taken aback by her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you don't have to do that! Once you find a token, just register it under your own name," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara shook her head firmly. "No way! They've gotta be registered in your name. That's the only way you'll have a shot at a higher ranking. Otherwise, we'll both end up in the dumps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused for a moment, then finally nodded, deciding not to turn down her offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara continued, "Which layer are you gonna be in? You're way stronger than me. You should be able to stay in the fourth layer for ages, maybe even last a bit in the fifth layer, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you flit between the fourth and fifth layers? Just steer clear of the sixth layer. No matter how lucrative those tokens are, your life's worth a whole lot more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned and nodded. "Sure thing! I won't go taking any unnecessary risks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hashing out their game plan with Clara, she headed back to her own courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was about to catch some Z's when there came a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced over and recognized Leroy. He opened the courtyard gate, a look of bemusement on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy nodded, his expression dead serious. "Osborne, are you really set on dueling Conrad in the sixth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm? You're no match for Conrad, and the sixth layer's a real death trap. Don't go off half-cocked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and replied, "You came all the way here just to tell me that? If that's the case, head back and get some shut-eye! The state duel's tomorrow. Don't go burning your energy on my business. I can handle things on my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Leroy hesitated, nibbling on her lower lip. "I'm sorry! Maybe I can't give you a hand, but I'll be there with you! At least if things go south in the sixth layer, I can pull you outta there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Leroy spun on her heel and took off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just shook his head, not really paying it much mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the night rolled by, and the state duel was finally on the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, Frost Peak City was buzzing with activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Folks from far and wide swarmed in to catch a glimpse of the event, and the city was all but bursting at the seams. Unfortunately, the state duel was gonna go down in the Arctic Maw Chasm, so they couldn't get up close and personal. Instead, they'd have to rely on some camera-like gadgets that had been set up in the chasm beforehand to project the action up in the sky above the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, there were two leaderboards floating up in the city sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was, of course, the old state duel strength leaderboard, with Agatha sitting pretty at the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other leaderboard, though, was as empty as a desert right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the state duel score leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the state duel hadn't kicked off yet, no one had racked up any state duel points, so the board was blank as a slate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the state duel got underway, the on-lookers could use this leaderboard to keep tabs on who was raking in the most points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final state duel standings would also be decided by this very leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, Osborne and the others had already made it to the outskirts of the Arctic Maw Chasm, all geared up and raring to enter and start the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert was hovering in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a wave of his hand, and in a flash, every single participant in the duel, Osborne included, got a chest badge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This chest badge had a screen on it, and there were two numbers flashing on the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, both of those numbers were a big fat zero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly cottoned on to what the chest badge was and what those two numbers signified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One number represented the state duel score a person had earned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other number was the ranking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both numbers would be updated non-stop once the state duel started. Once one found a token, all he had to do was hold it up against the chest badge, and the points from that token would be registered in his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tokens in the first layer were only worth one measly point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ones in the second layer were worth ten points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It went all the way up to the sixth layer, where tokens were worth a cool hundred thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert announced, "Alright! Everyone got their state duel chest badges, right? Now, head into the Arctic Maw Chasm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your state duel is officially kicking off now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
