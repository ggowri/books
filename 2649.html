  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, along with his disciple, attempted to escape Necropolis City through the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as he was about to succeed, Frederick suddenly threw a punch. His target was the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the black vortex raged violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That terrifying force instantly swallowed, tore apart, and completely obliterated the warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior fell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene shocked everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, that was a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior! Even if Frederick personally struck, that person should have been able to hold on for a moment and wouldn&rsquo;t have been killed so easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet at this moment, the raging black vortex effortlessly wiped him out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's even scarier is that Frederick's casual punch threw the black vortex into chaos!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the raging black vortex was like a life-devouring forbidden zone, where anyone who approached would face certain death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even someone as strong as Adriana had to quickly lead Osborne and the other four away from the vortex, fearing being dragged into it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick watched the panicked crowd fleeing, a contemptuous smirk appearing at the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You don't need to worry! As long as you stay away from the black vortex, you'll be fine. But you can't leave anymore. Did you really think I'd come to Necropolis City multiple times without any preparation?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Entering and leaving Necropolis City can only be done through this black vortex. And now, I've completely unleashed the power hidden within the vortex."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This power is enough to keep the black vortex in chaos for the next ten days. Anyone who approaches it will die, including myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you can't leave!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At least for the next ten days, don't even think about leaving Necropolis City. Only when the vortex calms down can you leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Frederick's lips curved slightly upward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued, "But unfortunately, you won't survive until then. Ten days is more than enough for me to kill every single one of you. Necropolis City is such a small place, there's nowhere to hide."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick unleashed an even more terrifying aura, and the dark red Panoply Armor on him began to emit a chilling pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You will all die here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you all die, the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom will no longer have anyone who can threaten the Royal Family, no one who can threaten me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick burst into mad laughter, his killing intent boiling over, and his aura growing even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's expressions changed drastically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked at the raging black vortex and the surroundings of Necropolis City, feeling a trace of panic in their hearts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Necropolis City only had nine massive Skyfall Monoliths supporting nine Skyfall Caskets, along with the Celestial Spire at the top.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Other than that, there was nothing else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such an environment, their retreat was blocked, they couldn't leave Necropolis City for ten days, and there wasn't even a place to hide.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone shouted loudly, "Frederick, you're crazy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think blocking Necropolis City's exit can scare us? We have nearly fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, while your Royal Family has only a dozen."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're not afraid of you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to kill us all here? We can join forces and take you down, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glorious Divine Kingdom has ruled for too long, your end is near!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, take action together, kill Frederick, wipe out the Royal Family. Once we leave Necropolis City, we'll divide the Glorious Divine Kingdom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, many people already showed hesitation on their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The body of the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior who was speaking suddenly exploded, instantly killed by the attack from behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It all happened so fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the people from various forces had not yet recovered. When they saw who made the move, their eyes were instantly filled with shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick laughed loudly and said disdainfully, "You want to join forces against me? Even if you truly unite, you're no match for me! Besides, you won't even have the chance to team up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over twenty of the fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors immediately stepped out from the crowd, standing respectfully behind Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people had just joined forces to instantly kill the one who proposed uniting against Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene left everyone present stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana's expression suddenly changed, and she questioned, "You&rsquo;ve already sided with Frederick?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over twenty of them sneered and replied, "We simply saw the situation earlier and made the wisest choice."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are no match for Frederick."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't want to die, I suggest you kneel now and swear allegiance to Frederick. Swear by the Divine Principle to become Frederick's loyal servants from now on, and perhaps he will spare you and give you a chance to live."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, you'll meet your end here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their tone was full of killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, the major forces had fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, while the Royal Family had only fifteen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They held an absolute advantage in numbers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They originally thought that in an actual battle, they had a chance to win and might even eliminate Frederick and the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, the situation has changed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than twenty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors from various major forces had secretly pledged allegiance to Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This shift brought the number of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors under Frederick's command to nearly forty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Adriana's side had only just over twenty left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number directly dropped by more than a dozen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The key point is that Frederick is a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, far stronger than everyone present.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, the Royal Family also has over a hundred guards at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana was completely at an absolute disadvantage. Whether in the number of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors or overall strength, they couldn't match Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faced with such a situation, everyone's expressions changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana clearly hadn't anticipated the situation would escalate to this point.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her expression was extremely grave as she quickly thought of a countermeasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick coldly looked at Adriana and sneered, "Adriana, I'll give you one last chance. Marry me, be my woman, bear my children, and I can spare your life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With our talents, our child will surely be extraordinarily gifted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marry me, bring the Fairy Moon Sect under the Royal Family as a subordinate force, and I'll spare your life. Otherwise, don't blame me for killing you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After your death, the Fairy Moon Sect will also be destroyed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Adriana coldly said, "Frederick, you're delusional! Even if I die, I will never marry you. Just seeing you makes me sick!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can even cruelly kill your own children, and you still want me to marry you and have your kids? You're insane!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you have the guts, come and kill me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
