  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria used Detoxify, which swiftly alleviated her negative state and allowed her to recover quickly from severe injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Detoxify is a unique application of the light elemental power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While I can't replicate the Detoxify, it demonstrates that the light element has a strong healing cap power. Clarissa's divine healing also uses the light element!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I can use the light element to heal my back injury!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Osborne made another attempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His light elemental essence was far more powerful than any other elemental essence, making it easier for him to wield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After acquiring the light elemental essence, he could immediately use the intermediate-level application, Dissolving Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a strange feeling surged within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized he could use the light elemental to perform an extraordinary power even stronger than the Detoxify.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to suppress the thought, he began casting it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated the light element and instinctively called, "Light of Redemption!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a brilliant light descended from the sky onto Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a wave of pleasure as his back injuries vanished in an instant as if they had never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His petrified body also returned to normal, the stone skin disappearing completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His nearly depleted spiritual energy was instantly replenished, leaving him feeling incredibly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body reached its peak in just a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation completely shocked Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light of Redemption?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the second intermediate use of the light elemental power. Its effects surpass those of Aria's Detoxify! It can instantly heal even the most severe injuries and negative statuses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with excitement, Osborne noticed Duke Medusa, who was pursuing him furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression changed dramatically upon seeing the brilliant light enveloping Osborne, as his aura returned to its peak, and the remnants of her petrification vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, what's happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger flared on Duke Medusa's face. She had always been confident, believing Osborne could not escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she felt the situation slipping out of her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne stopped fleeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His spiritual power was fully restored, allowing him to use interdimensional travels multiple times without issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no need to run, he casually waved his hand, tearing through space to create a dimensional rift behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to face the rapidly approaching Duke Medusa, a cold smile on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay back! If you come any closer, I'll escape through the interdimensional travel." Osborne yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa's face darkened as she glared at the rift behind Osborne, clenching her fists in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You deserve to die, little bug!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "You're only one realm above me. If I were also Class AAA, it's uncertain who the bug is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa snorted but remained silent her expression grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was only Class AA, and according to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' intelligence, he had just broken through. Yet, he proved to be a formidable opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized that if he reached Class AAA, she would be no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, few Class AAA beings could rival Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought filled Duke Medusa with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wasn't eliminated, he would become a significant threat to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really want to kill me?" Osborne asked with a faint smile. "Too bad you can't! I'm curious. What Duke Medusa number are you? How many Class AAA clones like you exist in the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Medusa retorted, "I'm not a clone. I'm a perfect evolved human born for war!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "It doesn't matter. You're not normal anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Duke Medusa held her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to trick me? You want to know through me how many Class AAA Medusa Dukes are in the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>? Dream on. I won't tell you. And don't even bother to know my number."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled lightly. "You misunderstood. I wasn't thinking that far. I just thought, with you all looking the same, the next time I see another Duke Medusa, I might mistake her for you and accidentally kill the wrong person."</span></p><div class="pagination">
