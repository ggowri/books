  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're asking for trouble! If you don't know what's good for you, then don't blame me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll kill you right here on this stage! You lowly Humans deserve to die! Get ready to fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar's voice was menacing as he spoke. An overwhelming divine power erupted around him, and a massive black vortex formed above his head, swirling violently and devouring the energy of the surrounding world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, it felt as if time itself had come to a standstill, with only the frenzied rotation of the black vortex dominating the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce and Kendra exchanged serious glances, their earlier bravado fading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had mocked Caesar with their words, but deep down, they recognized that his power far surpassed theirs. After all, Caesar was a late-stage Deity King, and the gap in their levels was insurmountable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The seven behind Caesar were also mid-stage Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seven mid-stage Deity Kings, alongside one late-stage Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On their side, only Anastasia had reached mid-stage Deity King; the rest, including Osborne, were still stuck at early-stage Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The average level difference between their group and Caesar's was a whole small level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Deity King realm, such a gap was enormous and incredibly difficult to bridge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, all eight of them were top-tier talents from the Paramount Supreme Clan, equipped with divine artifacts like the Supreme Malevolence Sword and the Supreme Malevolence Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Defeating them while overcoming such a significant realm gap was a daunting task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Take Mila and Tristram, for instance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mila, second only to Osborne and Anastasia among their group, had reached the peak of early-stage Deity King. Despite her efforts, she had struggled to defeat Tristram, who belonged to the Paramount Supreme Clan, and had ultimately failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Mila couldn't overcome Tristram, then Bryce, Kendra, and the others, who were even weaker than Mila, stood no chance at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With their hearts heavy, they understood the gravity of their situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this final showdown, with such a vast average realm gap and a disparity in divine artifacts, their only hope lay with Osborne and Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All eyes turned toward Osborne and Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne fixed his gaze on Caesar and the others, his voice cold and measured. "It's no surprise coming from the Paramount Supreme Clan. Among the younger generation, they've got a late-stage Deity King and seven mid-stage Deity Kings! Even if we had an endless supply of Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs, we'd still fall short compared to these super talents from the Paramount Supreme Clan. They likely have just as many resources, if not more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Paramount Supreme Clan was the true ruler of Celestara, and thanks to Lord Malevolence, their super talents would never lack for resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, do you think we have a chance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Should we consider retreating?" Zoe whispered, her voice tinged with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at her, a calm smile on his face. "Retreat? Why would we run? Sure, their average level is higher than ours, but it's not enough to make us flee!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, they're all from the Paramount Supreme Clan! And Caesar is one of the Five Brilliant Scions! Just imagine if we could take him down or even wipe out their entire group on this stage! Wouldn't that send shockwaves throughout Celestara? The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings would be known far and wide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, the eyes of his companions lit up with renewed hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From his words, they felt a surge of confidence. The thought of being able to take down Caesar and the other members of the Paramount Supreme Clan in front of a crowd of millions from various races sent a thrill of excitement through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's do this! With Osborne here, what do we have to fear? I refuse to believe that this Caesar can outmatch Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if he's a late-stage Deity King, I doubt he poses any real threat to Osborne!" Bryce declared, his face alight with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others recalled the times they had sparred with Osborne in the Hope World, witnessing his formidable strength firsthand. Their confidence swelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly! Why should we be afraid? We're going to take down the Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They rallied, and their fighting spirit ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the massive black vortex above Caesar was growing increasingly terrifying, wildly devouring the energy of the heavens and earth, enveloping the arena like an omen of doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar sneered, saying, "Are you ready?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're prepared, then I'll begin my attack! I'll show you that in the presence of me, you won't be able to withstand even a single blow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Or are you scared?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ready to surrender and submit to me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Tristram and the other seven shared mocking glances at Osborne and the others, their faces twisted with derision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked up at the swirling black vortex with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That technique was powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though they all trained in dark power, none could comprehend this move. Only Caesar, under Lord Malevolence's guidance, had managed to master it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When this strike lands, you will die!" Caesar declared ominously.</span></p><div class="pagination">
