  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I need to reach Class AAA for my body to be able to handle it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, with the help of the tempering of fate power, I can directly break through the realm and become a Class S Supreme Overlord?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breathing became rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was now Class A, and reaching Class AAA did not seem that far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Isa also mentioned that as long as he could defeat her, he would have the freedom to do as he pleased with her. Osborne speculated that he would be able to win against Isa as he reached Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she said that she was not the Class S Supreme Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, he showed a smile suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't someone who was in a rush to engage in sexual relations, and being intimate with Clarissa was something he wanted to happen naturally. He wasn't incapable of waiting. As long as he reached Class AAA, he would be able to withstand the fate power, so he could patiently endure until then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said with an indifferent attitude, "Are you feeling very happy? The leap from Class AAA to becoming the Class S Supreme Overlord is a barrier that blocks many prodigies. No matter how amazingly talented someone may be, they might never break through and remain stuck at Class AAA until the end of their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you, then, only need to sleep with Clarissa, and in the extreme pleasure, you will be able to break through the biggest barrier in your life. Aren't you very happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne touched his nose awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her and said earnestly, "Breaking through realms might not be as important as it seems. But when two people truly love each other, they should be together to enjoy happiness, shouldn't they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was stunned as she heard that, then her pretty face turned red and she spat at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't set your sights on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, she continued, "In addition, not only do you have to reach Class AAA, but she'd better reach Class AAA as well before you can sleep together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is this?" Osborne wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident that he could break through realms and reach Class AAA in a short amount of time. However, Osborne had no idea how long it would take for Clarissa to reach Class AAA as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because the fate power is also very important to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the fate power disappears too early from her body, it will greatly affect her talent and potential. In the future, Clarissa may not be able to reach the heights she should, or even her Soul of God..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said this, Isa suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soul of God? What Soul of God?" Osborne asked puzzledly. He felt that she was a little strange today and always said some strange words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said, "You misunderstood! What I meant was that it wouldn't be good for Clarissa to lose the fate power too early. If you truly love her, then wait for her to reach Class AAA and then engage in a relationship with her. Together, you can become a Class S Supreme Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, she is the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>. Her breakthrough speed will not be slower than yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne nodded seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Isa and said gratefully, "Isa, thank you! If it weren't for you, I might have made a serious mistake today. You saved me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne walked over and gently hugged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Isa didn't push him away anymore. Her icy expression slowly receded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned her head on Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hesitating for a moment, Isa bit her lip and said, "Bastard, I don't care how many women you have, but remember that I'm the oldest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was speechless and quickly said, "Okay, okay, you are the oldest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying that, Osborne glanced at Isa's firm and ample breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were really firm and ample!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand immediately grasped them, and the feeling of fullness made him unable to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's body trembled, and she instinctively wanted to kick Osborne away, but in the end, she managed to hold herself back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, after all, it was me who ruined your good fortune, so I'll just consider this as compensation to you!" Isa said proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing those words, he seemed to receive an instruction and immediately began to play more happily. Isa's face grew even redder, but as she looked at the unconscious Clarissa on the bed, a smug expression appeared on her lips, and she felt a sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fate! Grow up quickly and awaken the Soul of God. As your Soul of God awakens, you will find that you and I belong to the same man, and I am the older one and you are the younger one. Will you go crazy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa thought to herself, glanced at Osborne, and her pretty face suddenly turned redder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a lucky bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he was unable to do anything more outrageous because she did not allow him to do so and he could not defeat her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne was already very satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least he felt that Isa's hostility towards Clarissa had seemingly diminished significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, Clarissa was still in a coma, and he sat on the sofa holding Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, is </span><span>Clarissa</span><span> okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said with a calm tone, "Why? Are you heartbroken? Don't worry, I have controlled my power and will not hurt her, so Clarissa will wake up soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt completely relieved and said, "Isa, I have a plan, and I think..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could finish, Isa interrupted him and said, "If you're going to ask for my help, then don't bother saying it! I've already told you that you need to grow in danger and under pressure. Relying on me all the time is not beneficial for your growth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she stood up and stretched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, your girlfriend is about to wake up, so I'm leaving now! Remember, you can't sleep together until you reach Class AAA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, don't expect any intimacy with me again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, Isa hugged his head for the first time and kissed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, her figure disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne had no idea how she disappeared, feeling incredibly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at the moment Isa disappeared, Clarissa turned over, as if she had had a beautiful dream, and slowly woke up.</span></p><div class="pagination">
