  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got 10,000 battle points this easily? This is way too simple!" At this moment, everyone was extremely excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The warriors' projections emerging in the light pillar were merely equivalent to ordinary Ascension Ten Supernal Deity Kings, let alone the fact that they had already advanced to Empyrean Sacredness. Even if they hadn't, they were fully confident in swiftly defeating them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll take on the second one!" Someone couldn't hold back and rushed straight into the light pillar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A warriors' projection immediately appeared before him. Following Seraphina's guidance, he fully prepared himself and unleashed a force, striking the Battle Points Monument with precision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the Battle Points Monument flashed red, he immediately launched a full-force attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the warriors' projection on the opposite side was instantly crushed, the entire process taking less than one breath. He successfully gained a full 10,000 battle points from the Battle Points Monument, with the striking red number "10000" appearing above his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Subsequently, the illusory staircase to the second level appeared, and he proceeded to enter the second level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm next!" Then, everyone took turns stepping into the light pillar to challenge the levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, everyone took turns entering the light pillar to challenge the levels. Each person managed to defeat the warriors' projections within one breath, earning the maximum reward of 10,000 battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All fifty-six people took only a few minutes to pass the first level's test and successfully entered the second level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne appeared near the light pillar with Clara, Leroy, and Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them didn't have Satan's Eye, so they were unaware of the specifics and could only curiously watch the light pillar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne briefly explained the situation, they immediately became excited. "You can earn battle points as rewards for clearing levels in the Celestial Spire? These points can even be exchanged for resources, treasures, or even Sacred Artifacts or combat techniques on the ninth and eighteenth floors?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their eyes were filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded. "Let's go! The first level isn't hard, as long as we don't make mistakes, we should pass easily. They've already entered the second level, so let's catch up quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three quickly said, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stepped into the light pillar first, quickly completed the trial, and earned a full 10,000 battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he saw the red numbers floating above his head, he couldn't help but feel surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "How is this formed? This isn't just simple energy condensation. If it were, I should be able to easily destroy or alter it, but in reality, I can't affect these red numbers at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it, anyway, I don't feel any danger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Osborne entered the second level of the Celestial Spire through the staircase projection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The environment of the second level was similar to the first, also shrouded in dense black fog, but the fog was thicker, further reducing the visibility range for ordinary people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina and the others were continuing to advance deeper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, to successfully pass each level's trial, one must first locate the specific trial site. Once the location is determined, it relies solely on one's own strength to overcome the challenge and earn the reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Clara, Leroy, and Casey also successfully entered the second level, Osborne led them forward once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The trials of the Celestial Spire are way too easy!" Casey said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "Don't celebrate too soon! That was just the first level's trial. The higher you go, the harder it gets. Don't forget, back then, the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet all failed at the seventeenth level and couldn't reach the eighteenth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for whether we can pass the eighteenth level and obtain the key to the Skyfall Casket, it's hard to say right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing this, Casey stuck out her tongue. "Champion, you're right, I got a bit carried away! But as for obtaining the Skyfall Casket key, I'll leave that to you guys. What I can do is probably just accumulate some battle points here and see if I can exchange them for resources or treasures!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey had a clear understanding of her own strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the sixty people who entered the Celestial Spire, her strength barely ranked in the top ten. The six princes and princesses, along with Osborne, Clara, and Leroy, were all far stronger than her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, she felt that obtaining the Skyfall Casket key had little to do with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earning some battle points was already enough for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne shook his head and said, "Things will never be that simple. If it were really that easy, why would Emperor Frederick bring you all in? Why would Princess Seraphina fight for leadership and insist on bringing along a group to burden her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So I speculate that the rules of the later trials will definitely change! It might even require us to work together to pass."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It might even require some of us to make sacrifices to complete the challenge. Otherwise, with Princess Seraphina's current strength, wouldn't she clear the trials faster on her own?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey was stunned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she looked at Osborne with admiration. "Osborne, following you was definitely the right choice! You're so smart to think so far ahead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said helplessly, "Alright, stop praising me. Let's move on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne used Satan's Eye to observe the surroundings while following behind Seraphina and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, they found the second trial location, and a light barrier descended once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second level's challenge was roughly similar to the first, with the only difference being the increased strength of the warriors' projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, they were just ordinary Ascension Ten Supernal Deity Kings, but now they were at the genius level among Ascension Ten Supernal Deity Kings, capable of ranking in the top ten even in a city duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for those who had already advanced to Empyrean Sacredness, it was still effortless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Failing to defeat the warriors' projections in one breath would definitely be a mistake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle points rewarded for this level were similar to the first, with a minimum of 100 battle points and a maximum of 10,000 battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, everyone once again received the maximum 10,000 battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, everyone's total battle points had reached 20,000.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasn't sure what 20,000 battle points could ultimately be exchanged for, so he couldn't determine its value.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next is the third level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The test on the third level was still not too difficult. The strength of the warriors' projections was stronger but still remained at the level of Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, roughly equivalent to the top ten in the state duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, everyone who had reached Empyrean Sacredness easily passed again, each gaining another 10,000 battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, everyone reached the fourth level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps the tests of the first three levels were too easy, so everyone seemed a bit relaxed. However, the difficulty of the fourth level's test suddenly increased significantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were still warriors' projections, but their strength was already comparable to everyone's level before their breakthrough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, everyone became serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, several people still failed to defeat the warriors' projections within one breath, thus missing out on the highest reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, starting from the fourth level, the rewards also increased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The minimum reward was 1,000 battle points, while the highest reward reached 100,000 battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Except for a few who had unexpected situations, everyone else received 100,000 battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The difficulty of the fifth level rose again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strength of the warriors' projections was comparable to that of the princes and princesses in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, nearly one-third of the people failed to defeat the warriors' projections within one breath and only received 50,000 battle points, while the others got 100,000 battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sixth level, the difficulty increased again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strength of the warriors' projections was comparable to Seraphina's level before breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><div class="pagination">
