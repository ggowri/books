  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face was fraught with a deep, oppressive gloom because of his inability to steer the tumultuous waters of the family's dissent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had not foreseen that anointing Osborne as heir would ignite such vehement resistance within the clan. A misstep could further fracture the already fragile unity of the Augustine family, plunging it into deeper chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian swiftly contemplated a remedy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, his inexperience as the acting head left him ill-equipped to manage such a crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a moment of clarity dawned upon him; perhaps this was not his battle to </span><span>fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused inwardly, "Osborne, this predicament is of your making; you must resolve it yourself! It's an opportune moment for me to gauge your true capabilities. That esteemed gentleman holds such faith in you, even proclaiming your ability to rescue the Augustine family from its dire straits. Thus, I collaborated with The Wise Order to conceal your true identity and install you as the heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you cannot even surmount this hurdle, how then can you hope to salvage the Augustine family's fortunes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this realization, Brian fell silent, content to observe the unfolding drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne seemed privy to Brian's thoughts and offered a subtle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze settled upon the four most vociferous dissenters, but his composure was unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne inquired calmly, "Brian, might you introduce these individuals to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian hesitated briefly before nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Nathan and replied, "This lad is my son named Nathan Augustine. He means no harm and merely adores strength. At 24, he is a Class B metahuman adept at wielding fire, though his temperament matches his element."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne acknowledged with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A 24-year-old Class B metahuman was indeed commendable, on par with Apollo. Across the entirety of Skyefall, perhaps only Orion surpassed Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you raised a fine son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remarked with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, don't think a few kind words will sway me! I've made it clear. I have no issue with your claim to the heirloom, provided you can best me in combat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, dismissing the challenge from Nathan as he turned his attention to another of the quartet, a towering figure even more imposing than Nathan, standing over six feet tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is Kaden Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian continued, "He's the grandson of Manson Augustine. 26 years old. A Class B shape-shifting metahuman. Capable of metamorphosis into a colossal form, he boasts immense strength and formidable defense. His sole weakness lies in his limited offensive tactics!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was another prodigy on Apollo's level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man named Kaden voiced his discontent, "Brian, are you not being a bit too partial? You've revealed all my flaws!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian shot Kaden an irritated glance, choosing to ignore him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian pointed to the third young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Ryan Augustine, the grandson of Isaac Augustine. He's 27 years old this year. Do not be deceived by his frail appearance; he is the most formidable of the younger generation, a Class B+ metahuman master of gravity. It's a shame his extra energy is somewhat lacking; otherwise, he would be unchallenged."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Brian finished speaking, Ryan smiled and nodded at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, by blood, I should address you as a brother. I have no desire to contest the </span><span>heirloom with you, but its significance is paramount. Should an incompetent assume the role, our family's fate would be sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thus, I must fight you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was already at Class B+ at a young age, on par with Orion, proving his remarkable feat indeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne remained silent, his gaze finally resting on the sole woman among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She appeared to be around 22 years old, strikingly beautiful yet defiant. Her hair was dyed in a riot of colors, mirroring her natural rebellion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian regarded her with a hint of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to speak when the woman preempted him, introducing herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me introduce myself. I am Queenie Augustine, and others call me Queen. My grandfather is Manson Augustine. I am also a Class B metahuman with the ability of mind control and a Class B martial artist. Should you face me, beware! I might snap your neck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these words, she lifted her chin slightly with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "A Class B metahuman in both mind control and martial arts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having heard the introductions of the four, Osborne could not help but inwardly acknowledge the formidable challenge they presented. No wonder these four were so vehemently opposed to his ascension as the Augustine family heir; they were all exceptionally capable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the weakest were of Class B caliber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan, adept at controlling flames and harnessing their explosive properties, boasted an attack power that rivaled even Class B+ metahumans. He was likely the strongest among the quartet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kaden could transform into a giant, wielding immense strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, master of gravity, held the distinction of being the most powerful among the younger generation of the Augustine family. Osborne had previously encountered opponents who could manipulate gravity, so he knew firsthand how arduous they were to contend with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Queenie, her dual prowess as a Class B metahuman and martial artist made her equally formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is going to be a bit challenging."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought swiftly, weighing his options. He was deliberating whether to employ decisive measures to defeat these four and assert his strength to secure his position as heir or to maintain a low profile and conceal his true capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he showcased his strength, it would expedite his footing within the Augustine family, facilitating his endeavors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, such a display would be overly ostentatious, a trait Osborne had never favored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, Osborne made his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he had kept a low profile in the past was due to his insufficient strength and the need to conceal his cards to ensure his safety cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the initial ability to protect himself, maintaining a low profile seemed somewhat contrived and could only serve to invite unnecessary trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, Osborne decided to let the battle commence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pondering, Osborne fixed his gaze upon the four challengers and declared calmly, "Since none of you acknowledge me, let us settle this through combat! Which of you four shall step forward first?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. No need to trouble yourselves with such formalities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys come together to fight me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
