Only by announcing in public that he and Clarissa were lovers could the fourth test be completed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So tough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought the fourth successor test was more challenging than the first three put together.</span><span> If he weren&rsquo;t lucky, he might have failed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder even Godfather advised him to give up before he started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To complete the fourth test, he made a lot of effort and killed many people</span><span>, including, Apollo Chevalier, Orion Lark, and </span><span>Derek Chevalier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them</span><span> </span><span>were</span><span> </span><span>once Osborne's distant idols,</span><span> but</span><span> now </span><span>they were all killed by him</span><span>, serving as </span><span>the stepping </span><span>stones for his test completion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also, because of the fourth test, Osborne felt that he had indeed completed his transformation, which came from the inside out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was now full of confidence. Even if he was not Godfather's grandson, he was already an absolute big shot in Skyefall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter who he faced from Skyefall, he could hold his head high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when facing an ancient family, he was fearless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, the fourth test led Osborne to his </span><span>soulmate--Clarissa</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Clarissa, Osborne showed a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly opened the Draco Star Wristlet to check the rewards for completing the fourth test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First of all, it was still about Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The method to upgrade Satan's Eye from level four to level five had now appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class B mental power?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prerequisite for Satan's Eye to reach the fifth level was for him to possess Class B mental power. Godfather gave him many ways to quickly improve his mental power, such as taking medicine, injecting genetic drugs, and so on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne did not need these methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If nothing unexpected happened, his mental power would have already reached Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa told him that mental power was related to physical fitness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher the physical fitness</span><span> was</span><span>, the higher the mental power would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Isa, a martial artist, could be Zoe's master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was a psychic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isa trained Zoe's body, Zoe's mental power would naturally increase rapidly. At least before her mental power reached Class B+, it would be enough just to train her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Isa, Zoe's improvement was rapid, and her mental power had already reached Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mental power was initially not as good as Zoe's, but ever since he absorbed the unique energy of the blood diamonds, his physical fitness had skyrocketed and reached Class B+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his mental power also surged to Class B+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to improve his mental power, </span><span>simply training his body wouldn&rsquo;t be enough</span><span>. It required more complex training. However, Osborne was not a psychic, so the mental strength of Class B+ was enough for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect that the conditions for upgrading Satan's Eye to level five could be achieved so easily," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe even Godfather didn't expect that his physical fitness could improve so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month ago, Osborne was unaware of martial arts, and even the most talented could only reach Class D in a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne reached Class B+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't need to spend much time enhancing his fitness and mental power and could promptly upgrade Satan's Eye to level five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye of level five was considered above average even in the Augustine family in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for Godfather and some evildoers, few people could upgrade Satan's Eye to level six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Satan's Eye of level five! My strength is going to increase again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't upgrade Satan's Eye right away despite meeting the conditions, as the process was risky and required thorough preparation without any distractions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to check other rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second reward was still </span><span>about money-A full 20 billion dollars in cash</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>F</span><span>or Osborne, although 20 billion dollars was a lot, he no longer cared about it because money was just a number to him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He owned Luna Jewelry, Skyefall Security, and a diamond mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already had more money than he could spend.</span><span> He remained unfazed in front of the cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter what, Osborne was thrilled to have received 20 billion dollars, which he could allocate to charity or save orphans, making a meaningful impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then checked the last reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Generally speaking, Godfather would reward him with some tangible assets in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, after completing the second test, Godfather rewarded him with the Luna Jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the third test completion, </span><span>he </span><span>rewarded him with Skyefall Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna Jewelry was worth one billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Skyefall Security was worth tens of billions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Osborne was quite looking forward to the scale of the industry that Godfather would reward this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be a giant company worth hundreds of billions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and finally clicked on the last reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he was stunned.</span></p><div class="pagination">
