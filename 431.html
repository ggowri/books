  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a bright smile, but inside, he was incredibly uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but remember the last time he was here when Isa had pinned him against the wall and kissed him forcefully. Then he turned the tables and pressed Isa against the wall, kissing her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he had even run his hands over her entire body, lifted her onto the sofa, and pinned her beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Zoe hadn't come downstairs and interrupted them, he had no idea where things might have led.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, meeting again, Osborne naturally felt a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the one who was even more embarrassed was Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa clearly didn't expect Osborne to return so soon. As their eyes met and she saw the bright smile on his face, she suddenly felt flustered for some reason, and her cheeks flushed red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she quickly regained her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing here so early? I don't have your breakfast ready," she coldly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Isa's response, Osborne let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was worried that Isa would kick him out the moment she saw him, without saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Isa didn't do anything, that was a good sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least it showed that she wasn't truly angry about what he'd done last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, she would have definitely cut his dick off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Isa, I came because I missed you. Last time, you complained that I never visit when I'm free, so here I am."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's cheeks flushed slightly, but she maintained a frosty expression. "Did I really say that? You must be mistaken. And don't you dare sweet-talk me, or I'll beat you up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa raised her fist. But even a fool could tell she wasn't really angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't a fool, so he didn't take Isa's threat seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over to the sofa, sat down, and asked curiously, "Zoe's still not up? She is slacking off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa rolled her eyes. "She's not slacking off. She works way harder than you! She knew your mission this time would be dangerous, but she's not strong enough to help, so she trained extra hard last night. She just fell asleep a little while ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa also sat down on the sofa, stretching her long legs across the coffee table. "So, what do you want from me this time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious, and he said earnestly, "Isa, thank you! If it weren't for you, I'd be dead by now. You saved my life last night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa raised an eyebrow and replied calmly, "I was here all night until Zoe showed up. How could I have had time to save you? Whether you live or die has nothing to do with me, so don't thank the wrong person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled lightly, "Isa, it's fine if you don't admit it, because I know it was definitely you who sent Bryce to protect me. No one else would do that for me. In this world, only you would be so kind to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Isa pouted. She mumbled softly, "Humph, glad you know that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Osborne didn't catch what she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's expression turned cold again as she said indifferently, "You're thanking the wrong person. I don't even know who Bryce is, so how could I have sent him to protect you? And am I really that good to you? You must be mistaken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Isa, seeing her stubborn denial, and couldn't help but feel a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly stood up and walked over to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa immediately became flustered, clenching her fists nervously as she stammered, "W-what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't expected Isa to get so anxious. It amused him, and without warning, he spread his arms and pulled her into a tight hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, stop being so stubborn! I know you're tough on the outside but soft on the inside. No matter what, you saved me, and I owe you for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!" Osborne whispered in her ear as he held her close, causing Isa to tense up completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks turned bright red, and she quickly shoved Osborne away. "Are you crazy? How dare you touch me? I will..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her sentence, Osborne suddenly cupped her face and bit down on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's eyes widened in shock, her body frozen as Osborne cupped her face and kissed her. His tongue, quick and slick, slid past her lips and tangled with hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Isa was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected him to be so bold, to kiss her before she'd even finished her threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was at a loss for how to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I kick Osborne away?" she thought, but something held her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I let him keep kissing me? Would that make me seem too easy? Besides, this guy... He has a girlfriend, doesn't he? But then again, does it really matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was deep in thought when Osborne suddenly stopped. He looked at her with a smile and asked, "Isa, what did you just say? You said if I dared to lay a hand on you, what would you do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face turned bright red as she heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth and replied coldly, "Boy, do you even know what you're doing? Have you forgotten that you still have a little girlfriend waiting for you to rescue her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you feel sorry for her?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
