  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So many Essence Crystals! This should last me a long time! The mining area is right here, so I can always come back when I run low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it's time to head back to Wild Flame City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided to abandon his search for more Essence Crystals and made his way back to the surface to reunite with Jeffrey and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey and the Wild Flame Army members, along with overseers like Chester, had all been transformed into Blood Clan members by Osborne, becoming his most loyal subordinates. Naturally, no one cared that Osborne hadn't returned all night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon Osborne's arrival, Jeffrey immediately launched the Malevolence Airship, and the group boarded the vessel to return to Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three and a half hours later, the Malevolence Airship touched down on the outskirts of Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a centurion, Jeffrey had to report on their mission, so Osborne discreetly gave him a few instructions before letting everyone go about their business. He then retreated to his stone house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trip to the No. 9 mining area had been incredibly fruitful for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he fully recovered from his injuries, but he had also transformed Jeffrey and the others into Blood Clan members, solving the potential issue of exposure. Plus, he had acquired a wealth of Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was time to execute his second plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next step was&mdash;promotion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, he was just a low-level team leader in the Wild Flame Army, with limited authority and freedom. The important operations of the army were far beyond his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided he needed to rise through the ranks quickly, aiming to become a centurion or even a chiliarch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, climbing the ranks in the Wild Flame Army wasn't going to be easy, especially since he was still a native of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For natives, advancing in rank was significantly more challenging than for other races. The highest-ranking native in the Wild Flame Army was a chiliarch named Calvin, an elder of Lachlan's clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I want to become a centurion, I need to plan this carefully!" Osborne muttered as he stepped into his stone house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Harry and Amelia were practicing when they heard the sound of his arrival and rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne, they all sighed in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"O&hellip; Lachlan, you're finally back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia relaxed, initially wanting to call him by his name, but quickly remembered his instructions and changed to address him as Lachlan to avoid drawing attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Yeah, I'm back. Everything went smoothly. Did anything happen while I was gone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia nodded eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, a woman came looking for you last night, but you weren't home. We didn't dare respond. She knocked for a while, but when she didn't get a reply, she left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "A woman came looking for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered who it could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's memories of women were scarce; he cared more about power, wealth, and strength than romantic entanglements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Lachlan had a complicated love life, Osborne wouldn't have chosen to disguise himself as him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who could have come looking for Lachlan? Could this cause me trouble?" Osborne wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no point in overthinking it; without knowing who it was, he couldn't make any judgments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were something truly important, the woman would surely return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne dismissed his concerns and entered the room with Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stone chamber was fortified with an even more potent divine power, and Osborne had augmented it further, ensuring that even Celestial Deity warriors, let alone Deity Overlords, could not eavesdrop on conversations within its sacred walls. With this reassurance, he finally felt at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He produced a handful of ten top-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Harry, Amelia, these Essence Crystals are for you. Use them to accelerate your cultivation. You need to bolster your strength quickly. Otherwise, when I eventually restore your freedom, surviving in Celestara will be a daunting task for you. There's a high chance you might be recaptured and forced back into mining."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia's faces grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we already have Essence Crystals, we..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry started to decline, but his words caught in his throat as he took in the sight of the crystals in Osborne's hand. His eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are these... top-grade Essence Crystals?!" he exclaimed, her voice tinged with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled gently and nodded, saying, "Indeed, top-grade Essence Crystals. I acquired these unexpectedly from the No. 9 mining area. Take them and use them for your cultivation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed the crystals firmly into their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Harry and Amelia were left speechless, their breaths catching as they felt the pure and immense energy emanating from the top-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry whispered, his mind reeling, "One top-grade Essence Crystal is equivalent to 10 thousand lower-grade crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you've given us ten of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never possessed such wealth before, let alone seen top-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's said that cultivating with top-grade Essence Crystals increases the absorption rate of energy by a hundred times compared to lower-grade crystals, and ten times compared to mid-grade crystals," Amelia marveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's shock was evident as he added. "Even in Wild Flame City, only the big shots who reside on the floating mountains have the luxury of using top-grade Essence Crystals for their cultivation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions were a mix of awe and gratitude as they looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled warmly, saying, "Keep pushing forward. Only with greater strength can you truly thrive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if on cue, a soft knock echoed through the chamber.</span></p><div class="pagination">
