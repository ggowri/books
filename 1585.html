  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after Osborne and Donald left, Laird arrived on the west side of town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He made sure no one was tailing him before rushing to the courtyard. He used his key to unlock the divine lock on the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn Christine! Has she figured something out? She's getting way too suspicious&mdash;having people watch me all the time. I can't even come here as often as I want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christine Swift was his official wife from the noble Soaring Lion Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Swift family was one of the top powers in the Soaring Lion Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In terms of strength and influence, they were leagues above the Borden family. So, even though Laird didn't like Christine, he didn't dare cross her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Christine's father was a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And it was thanks to her father's influence that Laird had become a general in the City Guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Laird didn't like Christine, but he couldn't afford to offend her, and he definitely couldn't let her know he had another woman on the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every time he came here, he had to be extremely careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, all this time, his affair had gone unnoticed. Thinking of his mistress' alluring figure and pretty face, Laird was full of excitement and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Christine's getting nosy, so I'd better stay away for a while after tonight. But tonight, I'm going to make it count&mdash;really let loose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Laird stepped into the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as soon as he did, his expression changed. He saw that all the servants in the courtyard were unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it, something's wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird rushed to the back courtyard, and when he saw what had happened, his eyes went wide with fury, his face twisting in rage. His beloved mistress lay unconscious on the ground, completely naked, her beautiful body covered in bruises and marks of abuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything around him made it obvious&mdash;someone had snuck into the courtyard not long ago and done something unforgivable to the woman he loved most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird roared, rushing to her side and picking her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman soon regained consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she saw her condition, she froze, her eyes welling up with tears, full of pain and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My lord, I... I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She broke down, clinging to Laird, sobbing uncontrollably, unable to form a complete sentence. Her pitiful state made Laird's heart feel like it was shattering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lena, don't be scared! It's all right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everything's going to be okay! I swear, I'll get revenge for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman cried even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But... but I've been defiled. I'm not pure anymore. I've failed you, my lord, I&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird's eyes were bloodshot. "Lena, this isn't your fault! You did nothing wrong! Don't blame yourself. I swear, I will find whoever did this, and I'll tear them to pieces&mdash;I'll make them pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spoke with pure rage in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't care who it is. Whoever touched my woman is dead. I don't care who they are&mdash;I'll kill them to avenge you, Lena!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After making his vow, Laird carried her back into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lena, did you see who it was?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman bit her lip, still crying. "I... I didn't know him! But I saw his face, and if I see him again, I'll recognize him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My lord, you have to get justice for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her desperate sobbing made Laird's heart \ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gritted his teeth. "Don't worry, Lena. I promise you&mdash;I'll kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, something caught Laird's eye. He noticed something lying in a corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used his divine power to bring it into his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird's expression turned dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wild Flame Army?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Centurion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He ground his teeth. "A soldier from the Wild Flame Army? Once I find out who you are, you're dead meat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird immediately contacted his trusted subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get over here. Bring a lot of men!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I want a thorough search! I need to know if anyone's been in this area recently! And I want to know who this centurion badge belongs to&mdash;figure it out for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird gave his orders coldly, his rage boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Wild Flame Army's command center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The command center was where only the majors and generals of the Wild Flame Army worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman Saxton, being a general, had his own office here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?! You're saying Donald and Murray are both seriously injured?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Their divine essence nearly shattered? They almost ended up crippled?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who did this?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman roared in anger, his killing intent filling the entire command center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Someone dared lay a hand on my son?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't care who you are&mdash;you're dead! Find out who it was! I want everyone in Wild Flame City to know what happens when you mess with my family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman was livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald was his only son, and he spoiled him rotten. He'd never so much as scolded him, and now someone had almost crippled him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman was beyond furious!</span></p><div class="pagination">
