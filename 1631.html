  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now I can only hope that the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity can restore me faster than I'm falling apart," Osborne thought, feeling a sense of urgency wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no idea that breaking through to Level Seven would place such immense demands on the strength of his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It made sense, though; this was the realm of the Deity Kings. Not only was it notoriously difficult to achieve, but it also required exceptional talent and comprehension. Only a body as robust as a Deity King's could withstand the transformation of elemental essence at this level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne's Divine Body was already advanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, it was even a notch or two above most Deity Kings. The issue lay in his current realm; although his Divine Body was high-level, its strength hadn't reached its full potential. There was still a significant gap compared to a Deity King warrior's Level Seven Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I were any weaker, I'd be in serious trouble," he thought, realizing that if the transformation of his elemental essence had hit him even harder, his Divine Body would have shattered completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that case, not even the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would have had time to heal him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, Osborne began to feel a sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He noticed that the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was indeed powerful; it was restoring him faster than his Divine Body was crumbling. As long as nothing unexpected happened, he should be fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, half an hour later, Osborne's space elemental essence completed its transformation, solidifying firmly at Level Seven. He felt an overwhelming surge of power, a sense of mastery over space that was beyond anything he had ever experienced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, this is what Level Seven space elemental essence feels like?" Osborne murmured, a sensation of merging with the very fabric of space washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, he felt like a god of space itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, he knew this was just an illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's control over space had indeed improved tremendously, but he was still far from the level of the God of Space, one of the seven most powerful Deity Kings of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the God of Space had forcibly ripped the Blue Planet from Celestara and sealed the entire Celestara within Dimensional Space to trap Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was a feat Osborne couldn't even dream of achieving yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The God of Space was a top-tier Deity King, one of the strongest among the Human Community! It's only natural that I can't compare to him just yet. But aside from him, my spatial power must be among the best out there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When my space elemental essence broke through Level Five, it granted me two spatial techniques&mdash;Space Collapse and Phantom Steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Space Collapse remains my most destructive attack, while Phantom Steps has saved my life more times than I can count.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both techniques are incredibly useful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's a shame that when I broke through to Level Six, I didn't gain any new spatial techniques. Will this breakthrough to Level Seven finally yield something new?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he pondered this, a massive surge of information suddenly flooded into his mind from his space elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, he absorbed the knowledge, and a look of astonishment spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He exclaimed, excitement bubbling within him, "Breaking through to Level Seven has actually granted me three brand-new spatial techniques!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Spatial Clone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Spatial Cleaving!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Spatial Sealing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without wasting a moment, Osborne sat cross-legged, diving deep into the understanding of these three new techniques. With the help of his enhanced comprehension and exceptional control over space, he mastered them in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Spatial Clone enabled Osborne to shape perfect replicas of himself using spatial energy. Even a Deity King warrior would struggle to distinguish between him and his clone, as they shared identical power levels. However, the clones could only wield spatial power, which happened to be Osborne's strongest ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Essentially, his Spatial Clone would match him blow for blow in terms of combat prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This technique had nine levels of mastery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Level One, Osborne could create one clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Level Two, he could form two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By Level Three, he'd unlock the ability to create four clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Level Four, the number would rise to eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time he reached Level Nine, Osborne could potentially summon an astounding 256 Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just think about it&mdash;if he mastered Spatial Clone to its maximum capacity, he could command two hundred and fifty-six replicas, each capable of displaying his full battle strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought exhilarated him. What made it even more intriguing was the prospect of seamless switching between his real self and any of his clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne's original form came under attack, he could instantly switch places with a clone to absorb the blow. Unless an enemy could strike down both his clone and his true self simultaneously, they wouldn't be able to end him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, his eyes wide with excitement, "It's like I've found a cheat code for immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as I don't get taken out simultaneously, I can't be killed! This is practically... a form of immortality, isn't it?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
