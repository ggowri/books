  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry quickly assessed Jasper's condition, and his face fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?! Why are you attacking us?!" Terry shouted, glaring at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shrouded in a dark energy, obscuring his features. He merely chuckled coldly, showing no inclination to respond. "Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that command, hundreds of Shadow Drakes roared and surged toward Terry and Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already witnessed the devastating power of the Shadow Drakes, and with Jasper's strength being comparable to his own, he knew they had little to no defense against such an onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his earth walls had been obliterated in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Terry didn't panic. Just as Osborne had identified the weaknesses of the Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes, Terry quickly recognized that, for Supernal Deity Kings like them, the Shadow Drakes were a bit too slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with their overwhelming numbers, they needed to surround them to be effective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry was determined not to give Osborne that chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thick earth walls erupted from the ground, forming a barrier against the charging Shadow Drakes. While these walls wouldn't hold for long against the relentless assault, they bought Terry and Jasper precious time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grabbing Jasper, Terry swiftly retreated, knowing the Shadow Drakes couldn't keep up with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is definitely a hassle! Trying to take down a Supernal Deity King isn't easy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you can taste the effects of Soul Spark Oblivion, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne called out, directing the same devastating technique at Terry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of Soul Spark Oblivion was fearsome; it could forcibly ignite even a Supernal Deity King's soul. However, the soul power cost was immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most would need time to recover after using it once before attempting to cast it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's soul power was formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even casting Soul Spark Oblivion in rapid succession posed no strain for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, an inexplicable wave of soul energy surged toward Terry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry's expression hardened as he realized the true threat wasn't Osborne's Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes but this soul attack capable of igniting his very essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the danger, he quickly attempted to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Terry's soul power was ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he didn't waste time trying to extinguish the flames consuming his essence. Instead, he immediately severed the connection to his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face paled, but this quick decision stopped the spiritual fire from spreading further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had managed to block Osborne's soul attack at minimal cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, frowned in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "So decisive! He acted fast, but it's clear that my level is still too low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference in strength is glaring. While I can ignite his soul power with Soul Spark Oblivion, the flames don't burn quickly enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only I had a bit more strength, I could utterly consume his soul power in an instant, leaving him no chance to cut it away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne's expression turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But do you honestly think that will save you? That's downright na&iuml;ve! Each time you sever your soul, it weakens further. Let's see how many times you can do that before you crumble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile appeared on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's find out who breaks first! Soul Spark Oblivion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A finger pointed toward Terry, and once again, his soul was ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry's eyes went wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What! How can you wield such an attack? Is that a Divine Ascendance Technique? You can't possibly use it so easily and frequently! The speed of your casting is unreal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His shock morphed into anger, but he had no choice; he gathered his strength and quickly severed the burning parts of his soul again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every pass, his face grew whiter, revealing how drained he truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't done yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soul Spark Oblivion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soul Spark Oblivion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soul Spark Oblivion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed the attack again and again. By the fifth cast, he felt dizzy from the sheer drain on his soul power; he needed a moment to recover&mdash;but it didn't matter now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry's face was paler than a sheet of paper, the result of continuous Soul Spark Oblivion attacks from Osborne. His soul power had been repeatedly ignited, burned, and sliced, leaving him severely weakened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The majority of his soul power had already been severed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every inch of his body swayed precariously, as if on the verge of collapsing at any moment. His limbs felt like lead, and his vision blurred. He knew he couldn't hold on much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Terry looked up at Osborne, shrouded in darkness, a mix of shock and terror radiated from his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice low and strained, he sensed death drawing closer&mdash;Osborne hadn't stopped his attacks on his soul power, and the Shadow Drakes were closing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his current state, Terry had no hope of defending against or evading them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Drakes loomed, ready to overwhelm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne remained nonchalant, eager to finish off Terry before anything unexpected happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Terry was fueled by desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't let me live, then I'll take you down with me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Meteorite Cataclysm!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
