  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the barrier to Class S within him, so tantalizingly fragile that it seemed like the lightest touch would shatter it, allowing him to transcend to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he began, Osborne quickly realized just how formidable this barrier truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He attacked it relentlessly, but the barrier only quivered slightly. It appeared ready to yield at any moment yet remained frustratingly unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne had a reservoir of immense power within him, allowing him to </span><span>continue his relentless assault without restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having started, he had no intention of giving up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Osborne didn't know was that because his body was extraordinarily strong, his Class S barrier was also more formidable than others'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking through would be a tougher challenge. Few in this world manage to ascend to Class S&mdash;the path was reserved for those with unrivaled talent, insight, and perseverance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The primary reason for this rarity was the sheer resilience of the Class S barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This barrier was like an impassable chasm, a fortress wall that stopped over ninety percent of Class AAA individuals from ever advancing, no matter how desperately they tried until they eventually perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Osborne could even make the barrier tremble indicated that he was on the brink of a breakthrough. With sustained effort, he was certain to overcome it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed this closeness and immersed himself in his task, oblivious to everything else around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days flew by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the vast, lonely island, Osborne sat cross-legged on the beach, continuously hitting against the Class S barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in Newport City, at the Augustine Estate, preparations were in full swing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The estate, sprawling across nine hills, covered an expansive area&mdash;about three miles from north to south and over two miles from east to west, more like a small city than an estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could easily accommodate hundreds of thousands of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, the place was bustling with activity, even feeling a bit cramped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Representatives from major </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> powers had gathered there&mdash;a coalition of at least a hundred Ancient Families and fifteen major organizations&mdash;amassing nearly a million people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family couldn't possibly offer rooms for such a multitude. Many had to pitch tents wherever they could or simply sit on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions were grim; they all knew the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' army was on the move and would soon be upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In recent days, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had rampaged through </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. Those who refused to surrender were wiped out mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surviving factions had fled to the Augustine estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet even here, they were not entirely safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was overwhelming. Could the Augustine family fend them off? If not, all these people would likely be annihilated by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew it, plain and simple. Come tomorrow at the latest, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' army would descend upon this place like a plague, ready to lock horns with the Augustine family in a final, decisive clash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such was the bloodthirsty and ruthless nature of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>&mdash;known all too well by these factions. Decades ago, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' brutal rule over </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> underworld had become intolerable, prompting these powers to support Sebastian in expelling them from </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had come back for revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> won, none of them would be left alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope we can take them down tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people were praying at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the expansive conference room of the Augustine family, leaders from over a hundred Ancient Families and a dozen powerful factions had gathered, embroiled in a heated debate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesson, do you have any idea of our odds?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Decades ago, we helped Godfather Sebastian against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. Now they're out for blood; you can't just sit back and do nothing. The Augustine family must protect us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Godfather Sebastian? He was able to drive Gerardo out of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> back then; and he can do it again, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesson, we need to see Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he doesn't have a plan either, let's scatter and save ourselves! At least we can preserve our bloodlines!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesson..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voices made Wesson feel drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't tell them that former Godfather Sebastian was currently in critical condition, unconscious from his injuries. If he did, he feared the room would lose hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow and spoke up, "Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell over the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, everyone! Arguing is meaningless! We need to go back and prepare for battle. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> is coming for us, and besides fighting with everything we've got, what else can we do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> is our home!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can fight, we fight! If we can't, we'll still stand our ground! The Augustine family won't back down; if any of you want to run, then you're free to go!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
