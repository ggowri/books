  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, everyone had left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the entrance of the slave market, only Betty, Darren, and the rest of the Spark of Blaze remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally relaxed completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty, Darren, and the others also let their guard down, their worries melting away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He actually pulled it off." Betty and her two sisters marveled, their faces filled with awe as they stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being at the same Celestial Deity level, they had even advanced before him, yet they knew they could never have achieved what he did in his situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian alone could easily have killed the three of them, not to mention the threat from Oswald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Oswald unleashed his divine power, his face contorted with murderous intent, they almost believed Osborne would cave under the pressure and submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Oswald was no Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald had no weaknesses; if he had attacked, Osborne wouldn't have stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had stubbornly refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew they couldn't have done the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, you're amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and her sisters' eyes sparkled with admiration. It was their first time feeling such reverence for someone. In their eyes, Osborne seemed to glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't just the sisters who were in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire Spark of Blaze team looked at Osborne with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some had been skeptical about Osborne becoming their leader, only tolerating it because he had saved them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, every single one of them was thoroughly convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having Osborne as their leader was a source of pride for Spark of Blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the seasoned Darren couldn't hide his astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He actually did it! In my prime, even I might have only managed as much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian and Oswald aren't just strong&mdash;they have powerful clans backing them. Yet he, a Human Community member in a city that treats humans as lowly, withstood their pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's stronger than I ever was."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren was completely convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his mind began to drift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps he truly can establish Spark of Blaze in Wild Flame City, even make it shine in the East Zone. He could ignite a blaze that spreads far and wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alas, I'm just a broken man now. Otherwise, I'd love to assist him in battle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's spirits sank as he pondered this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go to find some place to stay," Osborne said as he rejoined the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing their adoring gazes, Osborne remained grounded and vigilant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew this was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spark of Blaze had many challenges ahead to secure their footing in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They needed to find a residence as their base first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I guess we'll need to purchase a big manor," Osborne mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With nearly five thousand five hundred members, Spark of Blaze had grown into a small clan, necessitating the purchase of a substantial manor to accommodate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only with such a residence could they establish defenses and ensure their safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, as members of the Human Community, they were always at risk of being targeted by hunting parties from other races and clans, snatched off the streets, and placed on the auction block.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Spark of Blaze had yet to garner enough influence to deter such threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final glance at the slave market, Osborne set off deeper into Blazing Flame Street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To buy a manor in Wild Flame City, one would need to visit the Urban Development Exchange, located further down the street and still open for business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, inside the slave market, Tiana furrowed her brows as she addressed an elderly figure beside her, her voice respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Eugene Royston, why didn't we intervene earlier to help Lachlan? He is, after all, our Super VIP. We promised to protect him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure of Eugene Royston, shrouded in a faint black mist with horns protruding from his head, exuded an aura of dominance, nobility, and sternness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Deity Overlord from the Demonic Dragon Clan, he sneered upon hearing Tiana's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Protect him? Why would we protect such a lowly human? We in the Demonic Dragon Clan would rather wipe out every Human Community on the planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a torrent of murderous intent burst from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If not for the Mystic Feather Clan always meddling, we would have exterminated every human in the East Zone by now. To expect me to save one? That's a pipe dream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thankfully, the good times are nearly over for those humans in the East Zone. The Mystic Feather Clan, their protectors, are on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once we cripple them, it will be the end for the Human Community in the East Zone."</span></p><div class="pagination">
