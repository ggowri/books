  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Infinite Devouring Eyes had manifested during the breakthrough of Osborne's Satan's Eye to Level Nine. It appeared as a colossal eye&mdash;a mere illusion without any physical form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This existence was both unique and enigmatic, even to Osborne himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With just a thought, he summoned the Infinite Devouring Eyes from the No. 9 mining area, and in an instant, it vanished from there, reappearing right beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It looks like it's grown bigger!" Osborne exclaimed, his eyes widening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the Infinite Devouring Eyes first appeared, it was roughly 3 feet in diameter, but now, to Osborne's amazement, it had expanded to at least three times that size&mdash;now surpassing 9 feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as it manifested, the Infinite Devouring Eyes began to voraciously consume the dense energy surrounding it. The speed of absorption was astounding, leaving Osborne utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A small vortex started to form around the Infinite Devouring Eyes; no energy could escape its grasp, quickly being transformed into pure divine power to elevate Osborne's cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt a rapid surge in his realm of power&mdash;a pace at least a hundred times faster than before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whoa, this is impressive!" he marveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he had anticipated such a rate of improvement, feeling it firsthand left him almost speechless with wonder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was already close to the mid-stage of Transcendent Deity, and in just a few minutes, he sensed his realm effortlessly shifting to the mid-stage of Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What was more, he could feel himself rapidly pushing toward the late stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This rate of enhancement was exponentially faster than what those prodigies experienced while cultivating with Ultimate Essence Crystals&mdash;perhaps even more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the thrill of reaching a new level of power flooded him with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Here's the place. If I set the Infinite Devouring Eyes here, with this pace of improvement, I might reach the late stage of Transcendent Deity in just two days!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In five days, I could hit the peak, and within ten days, I should be able to break through to Celestial Deity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His spirits lifted at this prospect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Resolutely, Osborne began to establish the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As before, he placed them within the parallel space. This way, even if someone were to approach this area, they wouldn't detect the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most they'd notice is the bizarre disappearance of vast amounts of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's hope this all goes smoothly!" he murmured, preparing everything carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, Osborne returned to the surface from the depths of the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lifted his gaze to the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thick, swirling mist enveloped his surroundings, and even with his Satan's Eye active, he could only make out the massive form of Divine Peak Nine floating overhead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Curious, he turned his gaze eastward, eager to see what secrets lay beyond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to his dismay, visibility dwindled to nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The impenetrable mist obscured all sight, rendering anything beyond a few hundred miles invisible. He still had at least several hundred thousand miles to the central area&mdash;a daunting distance shrouded in mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it! There's definitely a big secret inside, but it's not something I can explore right now. Whatever lurks within has even made the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity feel anxious, so it must be a terrifying presence on par with that massive root creature!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps the sudden appearance of the Celestara and these divine peaks is tied to that mystery! Even Lord Malevolence couldn't breach a single divine peak and ended up getting seriously injured&mdash;likely because of that enigmatic power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With my current strength, recklessly approaching to investigate would be nothing short of suicide! If I want to explore, I'll need to wait until I reach the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For now, I should focus on my cultivation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Infinite Devouring Eyes will take care of my realm improvement, but I need to cultivate my elemental essence myself to truly grow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here, my comprehension will improve dozens of times over. I'll use these few days to see if I can push my space elemental essence to Level Seven!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After settling on this plan, Osborne descended once more into the depths of the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sat cross-legged, but he hesitated to begin his cultivation right away. The thought of falling into an illusion worried him; after all, a boost in comprehension also meant a heightened danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although his realm was low, his soul power was formidable enough to theoretically withstand the creation of illusions; he couldn't shake the fear of the unexpected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne reached out to Riley, asking him to wake him every ten minutes just to be safe. Once that was arranged, he finally began his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he entered the meditative state, Osborne was immediately struck by the exhilarating rush of heightened comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt like his mind had been cleared, as if ice had enveloped it, sharpening his clarity and allowing him to think through problems with lightning speed&mdash;he could even draw connections he hadn't seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this state, Osborne's understanding of spatial power deepened significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been stuck at a bottleneck with his space elemental essence for quite some time, but now, with his newfound clarity, he felt it beginning to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could distinctly sense his space elemental essence pushing past the barriers, advancing toward a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Closer and closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The breakthrough was within his grasp.</span></p><div class="pagination">
