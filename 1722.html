  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce muttered under his breath, "Can we really take them on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others shot him a look, and Kendra didn't hold back. "Bryce, can you not embarrass yourself? Weren't you just shouting about how eager you were to take on the talents from all the races? You wanted to beat them so badly they'd be begging for mercy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you see their strength, you're scared?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I suggest we kick my brother out of the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings'! With him around, we won't get anywhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra's seriousness was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce immediately protested, "What's with you, girl? How can you talk like that? I'm your brother! I was just amazed at how strong they are; I never said I couldn't handle them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The stronger they are, the greater my victory will feel, you know? Raising the bar for my opponents means raising my own game! Sure, they're tough, but I promise I'll take them down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm the one who came up with the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings' idea; I'm absolutely core to this group. There's no way you can just kick me out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words drew laughter from the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra was only joking, but the reality was that the 250 talents on that list were indeed formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reviewing the details, everyone wore a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Celestara is massive! Anyone who can gain fame in a region as the strongest young talent is bound to be a super warrior! None of them will be pushovers, but we shouldn't be afraid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're strong too! And this list is just the beginning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These super geniuses are all below the Deity King level; at best, they're Quasi-Deity Kings. Even if we beat them, the impact will be limited. Hannah, could you help us compile a list of super geniuses at the Deity King level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A list of Deity King super geniuses?" Hannah blinked in surprise, looking at Osborne with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied casually, "We might need it down the line."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, the talents on her first list didn't impress Osborne much. With his current strength, anyone below the Deity King level wouldn't stand a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His true opponents would have to be super geniuses, at least at the Deity King level, or even mid-stage Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if they wanted to make a name for themselves, defeating Deity King-level super geniuses would certainly speed things up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure! But it'll take some time, and..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah bit her lip, her expression turning anxious, clearly still worried about the Bowman family's pursuit and revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reassured her, "Don't rush on the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, let's see if the Bowman family will continue targeting the Gellar family and the Mystic Feather Clan! Plus, one of the heirs of the Bowman family, Alfred, is currently at the Royston family's residence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfred is on the list too; he's one of the super geniuses Hannah identified! If the chance arises, our first battle as the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings' will be against him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of determination flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group buzzed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go check it out! We need to see how strong these super talents really are. I hope they're not just all show and no go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was eager to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah glanced at </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> her concern still evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move! Off to the Royston family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne led the group into the parallel space, heading toward the floating mountain east of Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Wild Flame City, the three major Upper Races</span><span>: </span><span>the Demonic Dragon Clan, the Mystic Feather Clan, and the Soaring Lion Clan</span><span>, </span><span>each occupied a floating mountain. The floating mountain of the Demonic Dragon Clan hovered high above, just east of Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the strongest family within the Demonic Dragon Clan, the Royston family held the prime central area of their floating mountain, boasting the best environment around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a sprawling expanse of jungle and marshland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Towering above the swampy terrain were several grand palaces, each incredibly lavish and ornate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, this was his first time on a floating mountain, and he couldn't help but feel astonished by the Royston family's impressive surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah explained, "Do you know why the three major Upper Races choose to reside on floating mountains? First, it's a symbol of status, setting them apart from other races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, they actually prefer to revert to their original forms, and the Demonic Dragon Clan thrives in damp, cool swamps! As for the palaces, they're meant for guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bowman family members should be holed up in one of those palaces right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, the rest of the group began to understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated his Satan's Eye and, sure enough, spotted numerous massive Demonic Dragons weaving in and out of the swamp, drifting through the murky depths, and even breeding in hidden nooks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that's a raw, primal scene!" he remarked, awestruck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted toward one of the palaces. Osborne could sense several incredibly powerful auras emanating from within, surrounded by a protective barrier of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he noticed eight members of the Bowman family's guard, whom he had modified, entering the very palace he was observing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" Osborne urged, leading the group swiftly toward the palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called upon the Eclipsing Mantra to cloak their energy completely, ensuring that not a trace of their energy leaked through and risked their discovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They approached the palace, hearts pounding with the thrill of the unknown.</span></p><div class="pagination">
