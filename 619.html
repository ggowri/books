  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rules for the heir selection of the Augustine family were certainly not as simple as that, but Osborne might have caught on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were about to go to war against Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their first goal would be the Draco Group and the industries of the Augustine family in the provinces of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. They planned to take over the industries of Godfather little by little to strengthen themselves and weaken Godfather and the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Augustine family failed to defeat them, the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> would replace the Godfather to destroy the Augustine family and become the underground king of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they had to do was to guard the Augustine family and the Draco Group's industries so that they wouldn't be taken away by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, and they should try to kill as many of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' masters as they could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they protected the industry better and killed more enemies, the higher their scores would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, it was the score that determined their ranking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and looked serious. He had crossed paths and fought with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> when he was still very weak. Not long ago, he even killed the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' disciple, Chris, with his own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew the power of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> very well, so he didn't dare to have the slightest contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he have to win this heir selection of the Augustine family against five competitors, but most importantly, he had to survive the brutal and bloodthirsty battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> would no longer fight a small-scale war this time but a full-scale war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be a war between two superpowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Osborne didn't know how many people would die, but with the violence and brutality of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, if they couldn't resist, the Augustine family would definitely bleed to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family would most likely be destroyed by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, where will the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' attack begin? Where are the areas we are to guard? What industries will we guard respectively?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Matthew asked seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather smiled faintly at him and waved his hand to project a map of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at an area and said calmly, "According to my information, there are a total of twelve provinces in this area, and they have all been heavily infiltrated by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, so their attack will definitely start from here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the direction Godfather was pointing, and Osborne couldn't help but become nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he realized that </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> and </span><span>Dampston</span><span> were both within this area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, once the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> started the war, both </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> and </span><span>Dampston</span><span> would be the first areas that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> would try to occupy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lips and looked worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have to talk much about </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. The branch bloodline in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> was the ninth branch bloodline of the Augustine family. If the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were going to attack </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, they certainly wouldn't spare the branch in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall</span><span> was also Clarissa's hometown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Radcliffe family was an ancient family in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, and the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> definitely knew about his relationship with Clarissa, so they probably wouldn't leave the Radcliffe family alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> started a war against the Radcliffe family, Clarissa would not keep out of the war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa belonged to the Radcliffe family, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also, the Montague family was in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin had now taken over the Montague family's industry completely, and the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were surely aware of his relationship with Austin, so they would fight the Montague family as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All twelve provinces will be the focus of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> attack, so the six recognized heirs will be responsible for the defense of two provinces respectively."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather continued, "If you have any energy left, you may go to other provinces to defend and help kill the enemy, and you will receive extra points! If you can't hold out, you can seek help from the others, but you'll get points deducted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can choose the area of defense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Godfather finished speaking, Osborne hurriedly said, "I'll choose </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> and </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, where I grew up, and I wish I could defend the places myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, Vincent, Matthew, Emma, and Lance did not object.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their opinion, these twelve provinces were more or less the same, so there was no need for them to compete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, however, sneered, "Why should you choose first? </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> and </span><span>Dampston</span><span> are both your regions, so if you choose to fight on your regions, you'll have too much of an advantage, and it'll be unfair to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, there are only six coastal provinces in total. They are definitely the first choice for the offense of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, so you have more chances to kill enemies and get points. Also, </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> and </span><span>Dampston</span><span> are both coastal provinces. What makes you </span><span>pick two?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd also like to pick </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> and </span><span>Dampston</span><span> if possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen looked at Osborne teasingly when he finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes instantly showed anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "My family and friends are in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> and </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, so I'm worried about leaving them to you to protect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen snorted, "You can let them leave and go back when the war is over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was worried about the Augustine family, the Radcliffe family, and the Montague family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, and all of their industries and people were there. How could they leave so easily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have to compete with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coldly, his eyes filled with indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't I compete with you?" Owen, however, defiantly locked eyes with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen had long been unsatisfied with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Owen's opinion, Osborne's power was completely inferior to his, and it was only by luck that Osborne could save the day in the fight and even get access to a divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen had long wanted to teach Osborne a lesson and show everyone that he was stronger than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two argued with each other, and it seemed as if a fight was about to break out.</span></p><div class="pagination">
