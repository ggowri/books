  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, May's voice echoed in Osborne's mind. "Osborne, let me go! Whatever you want, I can give it to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very puzzled, thinking, "Could it be that May is about to admit she has a problem?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly responded, "First, tell me who you really are."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am May," May said urgently. "Let me go! I swear, whatever you want, I can get it for you. I have the ability! Do you want power, treasures, or women? I can satisfy you, as long as you act like nothing ever happened."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly and said, "If you're really May, what are you afraid of? It seems you're unwilling to let me check honestly and are trying to tempt me with things. Sorry. Until I figure out what's going on with you, I won't believe a word you say."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne scanned May with Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May's power had been suppressed, leaving her unable to protect her body. As a result, Osborne's Satan's Eye could effortlessly see every corner of her body with absolute clarity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, after scanning around, Osborne was stunned because he didn't find anything unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned, thinking, "May has no issues? That's impossible! If May has no issues, why is she so resistant to being checked? Why does she seem so flustered? Why does she want to tempt me? And why is she begging me to let her go?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt he must have overlooked something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne scanned May's body again, even including May's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May's Soul Current Ocean was much smaller than Osborne's. Her murky soul power was no match for his pure golden soul power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne stared at May's Soul Current Ocean and noticed something seemed to be hidden deep within her murky soul power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne's Satan's Eye couldn't see what it was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Since I can't see it, I can use soul power to probe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's Satan's Eye emitted a faint glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Strands of pure and powerful soul power spread directly from his Satan's Eye, surged into May's body, and then into May's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, May screamed in terror, "Stop! Stop it now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to stop Osborne's soul power from probing her Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But seeing her reaction, Osborne knew he was right.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, May's power had already been suppressed. She couldn't stop his probing at all. His soul power twisted into a single strand, directly piercing into May's Soul Current Ocean, then rushed into her murky soul power, quickly searching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, May's face turned extremely pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having someone else's soul power invade the Soul Current Ocean is extremely dangerous and incredibly painful. Fortunately, Osborne's intention was not to harm her but merely to probe. Otherwise, Osborne could severely damage May's Soul Current Ocean with just a thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, May still felt the pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She cursed furiously, "Bastard! Osborne, you're asking for death! Don't let me find a chance. Otherwise, I will kill you. I will devour you completely!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne ignored May's curses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his soul power detected something unusual in May's murky Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed to be a peculiar bug.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was utterly shocked. There was actually a peculiar bug in May's Soul Current Ocean. This bug resembled a centipede, with many legs. However, these legs grew suction cups like octopus tentacles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those suction cups made the bug cling tightly to the barrier of May's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is this?" Osborne frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This bug was clearly something that didn't belong in the Soul Current Ocean. Osborne tried to remove it but discovered that the bug was tightly fused with May's Soul Current Ocean. If he forcibly removed the bug, May's Soul Current Ocean would inevitably collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, even if May didn't die, she would become a madwoman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were someone else, Osborne would have pulled the bug off without hesitation and studied it thoroughly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this person was May.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but ultimately didn't take direct action, merely continued suppressing May's power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana, come in." Osborne called Adriana inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing May tied up with the Dragon Binding Rope by Osborne, her face full of pain while still furiously cursing Osborne, Adriana immediately felt a bit guilty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She asked, "Osborne, did you find anything?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "See for yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne explained the strange bug in May's Soul Current Ocean. Adriana's expression changed instantly. She quickly directed her soul power into May's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's soul power couldn't compare to Osborne's, but it was enough for her to clearly examine the situation in May's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on?" Adriana was utterly shocked. "Why is there a strange bug in May's Soul Current Ocean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana asked May worriedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, May kept cursing furiously. She not only cursed Osborne but also Adriana, clearly completely consumed by anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought May's mind must have been taken over by that bug.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This thought made his expression incredibly serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe Primordial knows what's going on." Osborne summoned Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial stood on Osborne's shoulder. After listening to Osborne's account, Primordial was shocked. "A bug in the Soul Current Ocean?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could she be parasitized by the Soulbane Parasite? That shouldn't be. The Soulbane Parasite was supposed to have been extinct long ago."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Soulbane Parasite?" Osborne and Adriana looked at Primordial in confusion, waiting for Primordial to continue explaining.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said gravely, "The Soulbane Parasite is a strange and powerful creature. It can parasitize the Soul Current Ocean of any intelligent being, suppress their consciousness, devour their memories, and take control of their body."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne and Adriana were stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation is exactly the same as May's current state. The body still belongs to May, but her memories and soul have already been taken over by the Soulbane Parasite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was a bit flustered. "Then, can someone parasitized by the Soulbane Parasite still be saved? Is she still May?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, Adriana wanted to save May, to expel the Soulbane Parasite from May's body and restore her own consciousness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course," Primordial continued, "after all, she was just recently parasitized by the Soulbane Parasite. It hasn't fully merged with her yet. Otherwise, you wouldn't have been able to detect the Soulbane Parasite in her Soul Current Ocean."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, since you can still detect the Soulbane Parasite, you still have a chance to expel it. She might lose some memories, and her Soul Current Ocean will be injured, but she can regain consciousness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Adriana became very excited. "Then how can I expel the Soulbane Parasite from May's Soul Current Ocean? Tell me quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial calmly said, "Don't rush. Even if I tell you the method, you can't do it. Though you're strong, it's impossible for you to expel the Soulbane Parasite."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want to expel the Soulbane Parasite, there's only one way, and that's with fire."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But this is no ordinary fire; it's the Nirvana Flame of the Ember Phoenix Clan, also known as the Undying Flame and Resurrection Flame, the nemesis of the Soulbane Parasite."</span></p><div class="pagination">
