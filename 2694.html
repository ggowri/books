  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After rushing into Ice Crystal Hall, Frederick saw the scene of Osborne and the others disappearing through the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm one step too late again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's eyes were filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But do you think you can escape like this? I said I would hunt you down to the death, and I will! You can't escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter where you hide, I'll find you soon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick angrily threw a punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive Ice Crystal Hall instantly shattered. Over a dozen giant ice mountains of the Fairy Moon Sect also collapsed and vanished under his terrifying power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, you must save Weston!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Callista rushed over, pleading.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That damn bastard is still alive. He even seriously injured our son and took him away! Honey, you must save him! He&rsquo;s your most outstanding son!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick snorted coldly, "Why are you shouting? Of course, I will save him! Now, pass my order: issue a hunt for the Fairy Moon Sect! Announce that the Fairy Moon Sect has betrayed the Glorious Divine Kingdom and colluded with the Evernight Court. Anyone who finds members of the Fairy Moon Sect must report immediately! Anyone aiding them will be executed on the spot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, mobilize all the armies and all forces under our rule. Have them spread out and search! No matter where the Fairy Moon Sect members are hiding, they must be found! Even if they&rsquo;ve fled to other Stellar Regions, they must be tracked down!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick finished coldly, his eyes filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he closed his eyes, seemingly sensing something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The west?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seems like they're either hiding in the Evernight Court or have left the Racial Convergence Planet for another planet. They might have even gone to other Stellar Regions!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, they're definitely in the west."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick sneered, "They're most likely in the Evernight Court! After all, the Fairy Moon Sect indeed didn't have a Level Three Cosmic Translocator before. Their secret base must be on the Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They think hiding in the Evernight Court means I won't dare to find them? Ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whoever dares to stop me, I'll destroy them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick ordered again, "All of you, go search in the west! Spread out and find them as quickly as possible! Once you locate them, notify me immediately. I'll destroy them myself!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick soared into the sky, following the aura toward the west.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne and Adriana stepped out of a translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's so good that you're okay!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa and the others gathered around. Seeing that the two were fine, they breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, they had been in a constant state of fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick and his group's strength was overwhelming. Nearly fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors were an unrivaled force on Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the Evernight Court and Phantom Commerce Guild, as part of the three top forces, couldn't stop them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm fine now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and reassured everyone with a few words, but there was still a hint of worry in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Adriana. "Adriana, where is this? Is it safe enough?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana shook her head with a wry smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is the territory of the Evernight Court, located to the west of the Evernight Court. It's quite desolate here! This secret base is a hidden space left by my parents ten thousand years ago."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Under normal circumstances, this place is very safe and hard to detect! The formation here can effectively conceal our presence, making it much harder to be found! But with Frederick's strength, he will eventually track us down through our faint traces!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The formation here can only hide us for five or six days at most! After that, Frederick will definitely find this place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression grew more serious upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only five or six days at most?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even with Time Acceleration, five or six days can at most be extended to just over a year! Adriana trying to break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness by absorbing the emperor fruit in such a short time is simply impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness is a leap in the level of life! It's not that simple. It seems relying on Adriana to break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness to deal with Frederick is absolutely impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne began to think.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Adriana consumes the emperor fruit within five or six days to enhance her strength, although she can't break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, she can definitely improve her power. It shouldn't be a problem for Adriana's strength to catch up with Frederick!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, Frederick has Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor. Adriana has it too! Frederick has Inferior Imperial Artifacts, and so does Adriana! As long as her cultivation level catches up, Adriana won't be weaker than Frederick. In fact, Adriana will be even stronger!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So after three days, Adriana should be able to handle Frederick on her own!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And I can deal with Queen Callista! Handling Prince Quinn and Princess Naomi shouldn't be a problem either!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's just that Emperor Frederick still has forty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors. They are the real challenge! Their combined strength is terrifying! Meanwhile, Fairy Moon Sect only has May and Brittany as Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors. Among them, May is a Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, but Brittany is just a Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Their strength gap is too vast!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply, realizing they couldn't defeat Frederick and his group. They might have to keep running.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But running away is not a good option.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they stay here, the formation can still conceal their aura. If they leave, it will be easier for Frederick to detect their aura and find them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, constantly running away won't allow them to improve their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They will never be a match for Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, a cold light flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, do you have a plan?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, then shook his head. "I do have some ideas and plans, but whether they'll work or not can only be known after trying!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the unconscious Weston appeared in front of Osborne. His injuries were too severe, so he still hadn't woken up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at him, a cold sneer in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana gritted her teeth and asked, "So, in your previous life, you were actually a prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom? Emperor Frederick's son?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "That was in the past life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This life, I have nothing to do with that beast Frederick! I'm just here for revenge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then how are you going to deal with this Weston?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, I'll slowly torment him, humiliate him. I'll return everything he did to me in the past life a hundredfold, a thousandfold!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But for now, I still need to run some tests to see if he can be of use to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne closed his eyes and called Drum again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum quickly appeared on Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pointed at Weston on the ground and asked, "Drum, this person's Soul Current Ocean also has a Soulbane Parasite. He's already controlled by the Soulbane Parasite! Can you directly control him and make him follow your orders?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum immediately shook his head and said, "Of course not!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit disappointed upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not possible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then his plan would need some changes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, Drum continued, "I can't control him directly! I need to first remove the Soulbane Parasite from his Soul Current Ocean. After controlling the Soulbane Parasite, I'll let it parasitize him again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That way, I can control him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up instantly upon hearing this.</span></p><div class="pagination">
