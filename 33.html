  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The entire room erupted as Wesley&rsquo;s bid echoed through the auction hall. Every notable figure from Mayby City turned their incredulous gazes toward Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Someone had just bid 15 million dollars, and there were no takers. But 60 million dollars? Was this guy nuts?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But they understood instantly when they realized it was Wesley who shouted the bid and remembered his bet with Osborne. They couldn&rsquo;t help but shake their heads.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Ashford will stop at nothing to win this bet.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Well, what choice does he have? Losing means submitting to Osborne. Can Mr. Ashford and his family afford that humiliation?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Plus, it&rsquo;s not entirely a loss. Sir Ashford is a gun enthusiast and a major collector. His 80th birthday is coming up in a few days. Though steep, spending 60 million dollars on this gun will surely make him happy.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If Sir Ashford is pleased, Mr. Ashford&rsquo;s position as heir becomes even more secure.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s face was a mask of arrogance as he listened to the chatter around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He sneered at Osborne, &ldquo;You loser, I&rsquo;m bidding sixty million and ten thousand dollars. Are you going to top that?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an idiot.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the auctioneer&rsquo;s gavel fell, the final item of the auction went to Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley couldn&rsquo;t help but burst into triumphant laughter. &ldquo;Loser, I won in the end. I outbid you by ten thousand dollars, so now, in front of everyone, you can fulfill the bet and submit to me. Do it now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After an entire evening of frustration, Wesley finally regained his dignity. He laughed wildly, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Loser, admit it. Say that I&rsquo;m better than you and have defeated you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was relentless. He was determined not to let Osborne leave without honoring his bet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, the auction had concluded, and the winner was clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, the prominent figures of Mayby City didn&rsquo;t rush to leave. Instead, they stayed to witness the unfolding drama.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Many of them, hoping to curry favor with the Ashford family, chimed in, &ldquo;Young man, a bet is a bet. You need to accept your loss.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You set the terms and asked us to be witnesses. Now that you&rsquo;ve lost, we can demand that you fulfill the bet. Just do it already.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, honor your bet. If you back out now, you&rsquo;re making enemies with the entire Mayby City business community. We won&rsquo;t let you off easy.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Just say it. Admitting that you are defeated won&rsquo;t kill you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a lucky commoner. How dare you to compete with Mr. Ashford in spending? That&rsquo;s pure self-destruction.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Ashford is truly impressive. Dropping 60 million dollars without batting an eye earns our utmost respect.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s work together more closely in the future.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley felt even more elated. He bowed in gratitude to those around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Thank you, everyone. I look forward to cooperating with you in the future.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The crowd responded eagerly, smiling at Wesley while pressuring Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were shrewd individuals who knew which side to choose, the heir to the powerful Ashford family or the lucky commoner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Winning Wesley&rsquo;s favor with a few words was a no-brainer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for pressuring Osborne? What could a mere commoner do in retaliation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Young man, hurry up and say it. Stop wasting our time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t do it, you won&rsquo;t survive in Mayby City!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;We are all witnesses. You better do it quick or face our wrath!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The crowd continued to press on Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia looked at Osborne coldly. &ldquo;Osborne, a man honors his bets. If you still consider yourself a man, fulfill the wager. It&rsquo;s just admitting that Wesley is better than you. It&rsquo;s not the end of the world.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sat in his seat and couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at the crowd&rsquo;s words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at the prominent figures of Mayby City and said calmly, &ldquo;So you witnesses insist that the loser must fulfill the bet, right?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;We are here to ensure the fairness of the bet and to make sure the loser fulfills their obligation!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Exactly, this isn&rsquo;t personal. You lost fair and square.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Hurry up and say it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s smile grew even broader.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia frowned. &ldquo;Osborne, how can you still laugh? I&rsquo;ve told you that the gap between you and Wesley is insurmountable. You could never beat him! Now that you&rsquo;ve lost, you should see that I was right.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne glanced at her and replied calmly, &ldquo;Who told you I&rsquo;ve lost? This auction isn&rsquo;t over yet.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Laughter erupted around the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia and Wesley laughed, too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You idiot, are you out of your mind? The auction is over, our bet is over, and I won!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That may not be the case,&rdquo; Osborne continued. &ldquo;If I said the auction isn&rsquo;t over, it won&rsquo;t be over. If I said you haven&rsquo;t won, you&rsquo;re still not winning.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was stunned by his words.</p><div class="pagination">
