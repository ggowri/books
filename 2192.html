  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night embarked on the cycle of reincarnation over twenty years ago, and now, he's back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's standing right before you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's words lingered in the air, causing Lord Malevolence to go stock-still, and everyone else in the room followed suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne was taken aback, his forehead creasing with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The God of Night has entered reincarnation over two decades ago? And he's returned so soon? It sounds preposterous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As far as Osborne was aware, those who managed to return from reincarnation were extremely rare. Even with the most meticulous preparations, most people lost their memories the moment they were reincarnated, essentially becoming brand-new individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Retaining memories after such an experience was all but impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, it took millennia for someone to make a comeback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the God of Night had returned in just a little over twenty years? If anyone other than Isa had said it, Osborne wouldn't have given it a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swiveled around to survey the crowd, cranking up the power of Satan's Eye to its limit as he studied each face intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The God of Night? Where? I can't spot him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the God of Night's power, if he were lurking among the crowd, there was no way he could elude Osborne's sharp senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he glanced around, he realized that everyone was riveted on him, their expressions a blend of reverence and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden, disturbing thought flashed across his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Surely not...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could that be?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Out of the question!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned and shot a look back at Isa. She was gazing at him, her face illuminated by a tender smile, but there was more beneath the surface&mdash;adoration, respect, and maybe even love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was hit with a wave of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Lord Malevolence was also glaring at Osborne, his face contorted in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Osborne, aghast. "Wait a minute. You're telling me he's the God of Night? He's the reincarnation of the God of Night?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded, still wearing that smile. "What other explanation could there be? Haven't you been itching for a showdown with the God of Night? Well, he's right here, and yet you're dragging your feet. Are you scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's face turned grim. "It's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, he retorted icily, "He can't be the reincarnation of the God of Night! The God of Night would never choose to enter reincarnation! And no one can come back from it in just a little over twenty years&mdash;no one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the God of Night truly had a Sacred Artifact that could interfere with reincarnation, it wouldn't work like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence let out a mocking laugh. "Little girl, you're just trying to play tricks on me, aren't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'd fall for that? You're just looking for an excuse to push me into a fight with him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad your lie is just too outrageous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lord Malevolence spoke, Osborne felt an urge to agree. He wanted to shout that he wasn't the God of Night's reincarnation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't anyone's reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no memories of the God of Night at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Ophelia, for instance; she was the reincarnation of the God of Time, and her memories returned automatically once she reached a certain level of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, and Austin were the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had reached the level of an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, he could effortlessly overpower Ascension Eight or Nine cultivators and even hold his own against an Ascension Ten powerhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his lost memories hadn't suddenly come flooding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this point, Osborne and Lord Malevolence saw eye to eye. Osborne was dead-set on the belief that he was not the reincarnation of the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Isa flashed another smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one can come back from reincarnation in just over twenty years, right? But what if the God of Night... simply let go of his memories?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's words lingered in the air, leaving Lord Malevolence stunned into silence for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Give up his memories?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What kind of "return" is that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A warrior opts for reincarnation with a single purpose&mdash;to retain their memories. That's the whole essence of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Without the memories of your past life, you're nothing more than a brand-new individual, completely cut off from your former self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The God of Night sacrificed his memories just to make a quick comeback?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Lord Malevolence and Osborne were taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had always been so sure that he wasn't the God of Night's reincarnation, and the most compelling proof was his lack of any past-life recollections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Isa's words sowed a tiny seed of doubt in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the God of Night had shed his memories before reincarnation, then Osborne's lack of those memories suddenly made perfect sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So... am I truly the reincarnation of the God of Night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pointed at himself, his face a blend of shock and bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled, her confidence rock-solid. "You are! You know I might mislead Lord Malevolence, but I'd never lie to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my mentor, and... my beloved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over twenty years ago, you sensed that Lord Malevolence was on the verge of a major power-up. Your body was in bad shape, and you'd been stuck at Ascension Nine for ages, unable to heal or progress. You knew that once Lord Malevolence broke through, you'd be no match for him. The entire Human Community on Celestara Planet would be in grave danger&mdash;either massacred by the Dark Deity Legion or enslaved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You couldn't stand by and let that happen, so you came up with a daring plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reincarnation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's expression grew solemn, and her eyes locked with his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You found me. Back then, I was just a little girl, your newly-taken disciple. You divested yourself of all your power and memories, channeling everything into me, and then you voluntarily stepped into the cycle of reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the power I possess isn't originally mine. It belongs to you! Precisely! That's the reason I tracked you down on Blue Planet, in Rosmandi. I was irresistibly drawn to you and</span><span> taught you</span><span> the skills you once imparted to me. Ever since then, I've been gradually restoring those abilities to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's eyes softened, exuding a gentle warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no doubt about it. You are the God of Night! Your lost memories are still stored within me, and only you have the key to awaken them and make them resurface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And there's something else..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she shifted her focus to the God of Time, Clarissa, Emma, and Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you aren't the reincarnation of the God of Night, how can you account for marrying the reincarnation of the God of Time? How did you happen to meet the reincarnations of the Goddess of Fate, the God of Death, and the Goddess of Life, and have them all fall head-over-heels for you, willingly becoming your partners?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because you are truly the reincarnation of the God of Night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isa concluded her words, the crowd was sent into a frenzy of shock.</span></p><div class="pagination">
