  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly found the trial area on the nineteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The four of them stepped into the light, but nothing happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sighed, "It seems that starting from the nineteenth floor, teamwork is not allowed, and the trials must be completed alone!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, the others nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their expressions showed some disappointment. If they could team up with Osborne, with his strength, he might have been able to take them to higher levels of the Celestial Spire, earning them more battle points and benefits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, the rules changed again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Starting from the nineteenth floor, they could no longer team up and had to rely on their own abilities to pass the challenges.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And they all knew very well that with the current difficulty of the challenges, their strength made it nearly impossible to pass, let alone reach the twenty-seventh floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No worries!" Clara said, "Osborne, reaching the nineteenth floor is already more than satisfying for us! We've gained so much, even if we're eliminated, there's nothing to regret!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry about us, keep going! We'll do our best on our own!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. They had no other choice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're eliminated and leave the Celestial Spire, don't tell anyone about our situation here! If anyone asks, just say you were eliminated on the fifteenth floor..." Osborne instructed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others all nodded. "Alright, let's align our story first. Otherwise, if others find out we all passed the eighteenth level, it might cause trouble, or even provoke jealousy from some warriors..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They quickly started discussing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they aligned their story. The three of them were eliminated on the fifteenth floor while protecting Osborne. As for Osborne, they were unsure which floor he had reached!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Also, be very careful after you leave, especially with the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom and Frederick! Try to get close to Adriana from the Fairy Moon Sect and tell her you're my friends. She will do her best to protect you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After they finished discussing, Osborne was the first to step into the light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, the light finally responded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten warriors' projections appeared on the other side of the light, staring coldly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And all ten warriors' projections were at advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ten warriors' projections at advanced Empyrean Sacredness?" Osborne murmured. For him, it wasn't as challenging as the eighteenth level, but for others, it was much harder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the trial on the eighteenth level allowed teamwork.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But here, they could only rely on themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being besieged by ten warriors' projections at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, even Seraphina would likely struggle to resist. After all, these warriors' projections were far more agile than before, and they now coordinated with each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm heading out first!" Osborne turned to the women and said, "If you're not confident, don't rush into the trial! After all, you're safer inside the Celestial Spire than outside!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" The women all nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you be careful too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and took action. Facing ten warriors' projections at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, he easily took them down with the Bloodwrought Bow, earning the highest battle points reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that after reaching the nineteenth level, the highest reward increased again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who clear it within a hundred breaths can earn the highest reward, ten billion battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who clear it within five minutes can earn half of the highest reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who clear it within ten minutes can earn one-tenth of the highest reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who clear it normally can only earn one hundred million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne cleared it, the battle points above his head exceeded ten billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Clara and the others very envious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten billion battle points are enough to exchange for two of the most basic Imperial Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, the premise is that Osborne can clear up to the 27th floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, no matter how many battle points he has, he still can't exchange them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After clearing it, Osborne bid farewell to the women and stepped onto the 20th floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, he had to fight alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the difficulty of the 19th floor, Clara and Leroy might have a slight chance of clearing it, but Casey definitely can't.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would be instantly defeated and eliminated!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For them, their Celestial Spire journey had ended, but for Osborne, it was just beginning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the 20th floor, Osborne stepped into the light. His opponents were still just ten warriors' projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But among these ten warriors' projections, one had a cultivation level of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure enough, an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior's projection appeared! Normally, no one who just broke through to Empyrean Sacredness can handle an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior's projection," Osborne couldn't help but complain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The difficulty of the Celestial Spire challenge was truly too high. Only Osborne, who advanced straight to advanced Empyrean Sacredness upon breaking through, could face an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection opponent without falling into despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne, an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection opponent could only barely pique his interest. After all, even before his breakthrough, if he unleashed his trump card and used his strongest Heaven Arrow, he had already defeated an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now he defeated the Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors' projections with ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A loud bang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the Sacred Power Arrow, both advanced Empyrean Sacredness and Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors' projections were shattered. Osborne effortlessly passed the test of the twentieth level and continued toward his goal, the twenty-seventh level!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the twenty-first level, five out of Osborne's ten opponents were Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors' projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the twenty-second level, all ten of his opponents were Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors' projections!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the twenty-third level, a single Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior's projection appeared!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the twenty-fourth level, there were five Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors' projections!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the twenty-fifth level, there were ten Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors' projections!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the twenty-sixth level, there were fifty Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors' projections!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Osborne was surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Fifty Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors' projections?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I thought Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors' projections would appear... Luckily, they aren't Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors' projections, or the opponents would be even harder to deal with!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression was serious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fifty Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors' projections were already terrifying, and most importantly, these fifty warriors' projections were incredibly agile, as if they possessed immense intelligence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne couldn't kill them all instantly, he would end up surrounded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Things would get bad then!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Only the last two levels left! As long as I pass these two tests, I can obtain the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket and exchange the massive battle points for treasures and resources..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must succeed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with determination and fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked up at the battle points above his head...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the battle points he had gained were already immense, so much that Osborne felt it was almost unreal. If he failed the challenge and all these battle points were reset to zero, he would be very disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle points he had gained at this moment had reached 1.33 trillion!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These over one trillion battle points could be used to exchange for Perfect Dragon Elixir, enough for more than a thousand drops!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If used to exchange for the most common Imperial Artifact, they could get over two hundred pieces!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne would never allow these battle points to be reset to zero. He must pass the final tests of the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Continue!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
