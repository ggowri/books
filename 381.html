  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought for a while before saying, "An ancient magic weapon of at least level three? What a big bet. It's enough to bet my life. It seems that you are confident that you can kill me with one move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But do you have the right to give me the magic weapon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could speak, Wade said coldly, "Alexander is the heir of the Paltrow family. Now that he is a Class A Power Master, he will become the new head of the family after he marries Clarissa next month. His decision is the Paltrow family's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a level three ancient magic weapon. He naturally has the right to put it as a bet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Wade finished speaking, the crowd was surprised again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander would be the new head of the Paltrow family next month! He was still so young!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family was really courageous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "So, do you dare to take my bet? I guess your family doesn't even have a level three ancient magic weapon, right? As long as you bear my attack and survive, you can get a level three ancient magic weapon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne started thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not thinking about whether to take the bet but was thinking about why Alexander was so confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander definitely didn't know Osborne's real strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he certainly would not underestimate Osborne. After all, Osborne had defeated Yohan and Lauren and forced them to jump into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, why did Alexander still believe that he could kill Osborne with just one move?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, his power was not stable, and he could only exert 10% of his power. Why was he so confident that he could kill Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that there was some conspiracy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Alexander, wanting to know why he thought he could kill him with one move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac came to Osborne's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered, "Osborne, don't take his bet. I don't know why he has such confidence, but I think there must be something wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We don't have a level three ancient magic weapon, but if you have to gamble your life on it, it is not worthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't risk your life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reject him. Don't mind losing face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isaac spoke, his face was full of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not agree but asked, "Isaac, given Alexander's current state, do you think he can attack me with all his strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Isaac shook his head. "If Alexander dares to attack you with all his strength, he will be in danger. His unstable power will get out of control, and he will definitely be seriously injured. He can only use 30% of his power at most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could use 30% of his power at most, which was two times more than the 10% that he had just said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, was this why Alexander was confident?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought he could kill Osborne in one move with 30% of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought it was possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Alexander was not an ordinary Class A Power Master. Thirty percent of his strength was actually terrifying, not less capable than the full-strength attack of an ordinary Power Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought Osborne was only a Class B+ metahuman, and it was no problem for him to kill Osborne with a single move using only 30% of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne made a decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would fight with Alexander not long after. If he couldn't even withstand an attack with 30% of Alexander's strength, how could he win the fight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he had to take the bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a chance for Osborne. He could quickly know Alexander's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the third-level ancient magic weapon, he didn't care too much about it. Strength was his foundation. Over-reliance on external things was not conducive to his improvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he would not refuse a chance to get a level three ancient magic weapon for free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Okay, I take the bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can't even take your single move, I deserve to die. My family won't avenge me. If I bear your attack and survive, you must give me a level three ancient magic weapon as you promised."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, the crowd started whispering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He actually took the bet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must have been tempted by the level three ancient magic weapon. He is just an ordinary Class B+ metahuman, and he doesn't know how powerful a Class A Power Master is. Even if Alexander only exerts 10% of his power, Osborne can't bear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is going to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The head of the Augustine family just died, and the heir is going to die today. Isaac is old. The Augustine family is really going to decline!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is too arrogant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed. "You are quite courageous, Osborne. I hope you don't regret it... Oh, you probably won't have the chance to regret it. You're going to die here today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding people immediately stepped back, leaving a battlefield for Alexander and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac sighed. Osborne did not follow his advice but chose to take the bet. He was worried, but he didn't say anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He respected Osborne's decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac patted Osborne on the shoulder, reminded him to be careful, and then went to a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne and Alexander were the only ones left within one hundred yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Alexander, and a fighting spirit was surging in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at Osborne with a smile, but his eyes were full of murderous intent and contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that he would definitely win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm, but he became more alert and made preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "Osborne, are you ready?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take action!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at the sky. This is your last time to see it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Alexander took action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
