  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just when Osborne expected Algernon to lead the exploration team directly into the ambush set by the Deathborn, the captain suddenly came to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon warned, his tone firm, "Everyone, be cautious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The moment we touch down on Divine Peak Nine is when we're most vulnerable to Deathborn attacks. The Deathborn up here are cunning; they leverage their advantages expertly. Their perception is sharper than ours. We might not see them, but they can detect us long before we realize they're there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If they find themselves outmatched in a straight-up fight, they'll disguise themselves and lie in wait, ready to ambush us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, be on your guard. Make sure to verify that everything around you isn't a disguise for a Deathborn. Be ready to defend and counter at any moment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words heightened the team's vigilance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne studied Algernon with newfound respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "Not bad. No wonder he's captain&mdash;the guy's got the guts to lead from the front. He clearly knows his stuff. In that light, those six Deathborns don't pose much of a threat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, as the team proceeded with heightened alertness, they eventually spotted the hidden Deathborn squad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the best disguises had their flaws; all it took was a keen eye to uncover them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once spotted, the six Deathborns didn't linger. Aware that they were outmatched, they quickly shifted into their ethereal form, seamlessly merging with the essence of Divine Peak Nine and disappearing from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon and the others were left with no option to pursue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rock and soil of Divine Peak Nine were far too dense; they couldn't hope to catch up with the Deathborn, who could glide effortlessly through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne maintained focus with his Satan's Eye still trained on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He noticed that shortly after the six Deathborns merged with the mountain, they were expelled by an unseen force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They drifted back to the ground, but instead of fleeing, they trailed the exploration team from a distance. The heavy fog and their considerable distance meant the explorers remained blissfully unaware of their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But one of the Deathborn darted deeper into Divine Peak Nine, and Osborne's expression shifted from curiosity to alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, something's off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him, puzzled. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Those six Deathborns didn't leave. They're still following us&mdash;it's just that one of them took off. I suspect he's going for reinforcements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in shock. "You think so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded emphatically. "I finally understand why the casualty rate for exploration teams in Divine Peak Nine is so high! As long as the Deathborn spot a team and some get away, they'll call for backup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This means we should expect more Deathborn attacks ahead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's brow furrowed with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne replied, "For me, it's not that complicated! If I can take out the five Deathborns trailing us and make a quick exit, their reinforcements will show up without a clue as to where we went."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded, realizing the grim truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Osborne might handle the Deathborn with ease, the rest of the team would struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once a team caught the Deathborn's attention, their fate was virtually sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The past showed that nine out of ten explorers wouldn't return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, are you going to act?" Diana asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head, a confident smile on his face. "No need to rush! We've only just arrived at Divine Peak Nine; let's assess the situation first. Besides, I've noticed something interesting&mdash;the Deathborn seem unable to stay hidden in their ethereal forms for long. It appears that Divine Peak Nine emits a strange force that pushes them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really? If that's the case, taking them down will be a lot easier! The reason the Deathborn have been such a headache is that whenever they're overmatched, they just slip into the ethereal realm to hide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "It seems that way! But I'll need to keep an eye on it before drawing any firm conclusions. Let's move forward for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon had already led the group deeper into the heart of Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thanks to the earlier warning about the Deathborn, his reputation soared among the explorers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Regardless of their past opinions, everyone now respected him. Without Algernon's keen insight, they would have blundered right into the Deathborn's trap, completely unprepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had even gathered their divine power and hadn't raised any defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Had they crossed paths with the Deathborn squad, it was likely that several team members would have sustained serious injuries&mdash;or worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A newfound respect permeated the group as they navigated the rocky terrain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, unbeknownst to them, the Deathborn were still trailing closely behind.</span></p><div class="pagination">
