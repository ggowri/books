  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne knew he had only one shot to avoid being overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once he struck, he had to make a quick getaway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To maximize his impact on the Class S clones, he had to unleash his most potent attacks in the shortest time possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He mentally organized his arsenal, readying all the techniques that could pose a serious threat to the Class S clones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the moment to strike approached, he steeled himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Here goes nothing!" Osborne thought, and then he unleashed his onslaught.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Light Realm! Destruction Orbs! Disintegration Rays!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the vast expanse of the Light Realm enveloped not just the eight Class S clones but also thousands of ordinary clones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The battlefield erupted in chaos as countless Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays burst forth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While these radiant attacks wouldn't deal fatal damage to the Class S clones, they would certainly confuse them and swiftly eliminate regular clones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne's true killing blow was yet to come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Goddess of Grain's Scythe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vampire Transformation!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Breath of Celestial!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Explosive Force!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Come on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the clones disoriented, Osborne seized the moment. Armed with the Goddess of Grain's scythe, he materialized behind two Class S clones, swinging the scythe with all his might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a heartbeat, their heads flew off, their bodies collapsing before they even had time to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he wasn't done yet. With a powerful kick, he unleashed the strength of his Divine Bone, propelling himself forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His leg connected with the back of another Class S clone, sending it crashing into its comrade, resulting in a thunderous explosion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two more Class S clones fell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the remaining four Class S clones finally snapped to attention, their fury igniting as they charged at Osborne. Meanwhile, his Light Realm was under siege, crumbling under a barrage of attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne faced the four approaching clones, a cold smile creeping across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He recognized them: two were Tauren Kings, and two were Vampire Kings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had intentionally left these foes standing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Tauren Kings boasted formidable defenses, and Osborne knew he couldn't take them down in one swift move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for the Vampire Kings, he had a distinct advantage over them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Time to die!" Osborne shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a flick of his wrist, he manipulated the blood within the bodies of the two Vampire Kings. Before they even realized what was happening, their bodies exploded in a gruesome display.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Osborne's Light Realm shattered completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thousands of clones, filled with murderous intent, turned their attention to him, launching a relentless wave of attacks. Osborne felt his heart race as Satan's Eye pulsed wildly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't stay here any longer! I have to get out!" Osborne thought, not daring to hesitate even for a second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He made a hasty retreat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The very spot he had just vacated was instantly engulfed by a torrent of attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Had he lingered even a moment longer, he would have either been killed or severely injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a burst of speed, Osborne dashed into the ranks of the Blood Demon members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Relief washed over him as he saw their faces light up with encouragement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They cheered, their spirits lifting at his arrival. They quickly sprang into action, shielding him from the onslaught of attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Osborne exhaled, a wave of relief flooding over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have made it back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Sebastian appeared at his side. Though his face was a bit pale, he wore a grin that spoke volumes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How many did you take down?" Sebastian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, puffing out his chest with pride, waggled six fingers in front of Sebastian. "Six! I managed to take out six of them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian raised an eyebrow, clearly impressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was only Class AAA, yet he had just obliterated six Class S clones in an instant. These weren't run-of-the-mill fighters; although they lacked mastery of the Realm, their strength was still nothing to sneeze at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian had anticipated that Osborne might take out one or two, but six? Now that was something else entirely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Impressive! If you keep growing like this, it won't be long before nobody dares to mess with the Augustine family!" Sebastian chuckled, pride swelling in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feeling a bit cocky, Osborne then asked, "What about you, Grandpa? How many did you take down?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian smirked. "Eight. Wiped them all out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eight?! With your injuries?" Osborne thought, momentarily stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had thought he'd done well with six, but compared to his grandfather, he still had a long way to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, time to turn the tables!" Sebastian announced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had just taken out fourteen out of sixteen Class S clones, leaving only the two Tauren Kings standing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not to mention, Osborne had also managed to wipe out several hundred ordinary clones in the chaos. The Aberrants' army was already starting to falter, their ranks disorganized and confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The momentum of the battle had shifted dramatically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne couldn't help but let a cold smile creep across his face. "Listen up, everyone in Blood Demon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Follow my lead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's wipe them out!"</p><div class="pagination">
