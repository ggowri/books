  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was shocked to the core, never having witnessed such a bizarre situation before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How was this possible? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was this person even human?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A bullet hitting the eye at close range, and he was still alive?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And that strange eyeball managed to stop the bullet?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill you!&rdquo; Milo roared in anger, his other eye now emanating an even more eerie purple light, like veins spreading across his face as he stared intensely at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, Osborne felt as though his brain had been struck by a heavy hammer, leaving him dazed and losing control of his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the next moment, a refreshing sensation surged through his Satan&rsquo;s Eye, instantly clearing his confused mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Milo exclaimed in disbelief, looking at Osborne with a hint of doubt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You resisted my psychic abilities? You&rsquo;re not just an ordinary human?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now calmed down, Osborne coldly snorted, saying, &ldquo;Just realizing now? It&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Osborne fired off a series of shots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The bullets rained down on Milo, who was prepared this time, showing no fear on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He sneered, the purple light in his eyes intensifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Surprisingly, all the bullets in mid-air changed direction, hitting the wall behind Milo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was once again startled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Milo grinned wickedly and launched a punch at Osborne&rsquo;s chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But to Osborne, it all seemed like slow motion through his Satan&rsquo;s Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He effortlessly evaded the punch, causing Milo to strike the wall with tremendous force, creating a gaping hole and shaking the entire building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was astounded by Milo&rsquo;s terrifying strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Similarly, Milo was surprised that Osborne could dodge his attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unable to land a hit, Milo frowned as Osborne skillfully evaded his blows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he finally landed a punch on Osborne, Osborne stepped back, unscathed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Milo couldn&rsquo;t comprehend how Osborne could resist his psychic abilities, evade his attacks, and display strength comparable to his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Momentarily at a loss, Milo found himself unable to contend with Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before coming here, he never imagined Osborne would be so formidable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Should have asked Justin for five million dollars,</span> Milo thought, already contemplating retreat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, his gaze shifted to Anastasia lying on the bed, a sinister smirk appearing on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ignoring Osborne, Milo charged towards the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s expression hardened drastically as he frantically tried to stop Milo. Though he managed to dodge Milo&rsquo;s attacks, he couldn&rsquo;t defeat him. His only option was to entangle Milo with all his might, but Milo steadily advanced towards Anastasia&rsquo;s bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In his attempts to thwart Milo, Osborne inadvertently left himself vulnerable, getting struck twice by Milo and nearly spitting out blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Prey&hellip;&rdquo; Milo growled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He reached the bedside, extending his claw-like hand towards Anastasia aggressively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Osborne roared, his eyes crazed with anger as if a lone wolf in a desperate situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unwilling to dodge anymore, he charged forward recklessly, exposing more weaknesses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While momentarily halting Milo, Osborne was repeatedly injured by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was Milo&rsquo;s plan all along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You dared to harm my eye; I&rsquo;ll make you pay with yours.&rdquo; Milo&rsquo;s eyes emitted a chilling cold light as he fiercely grabbed Osborne&rsquo;s arm, and his other hand viciously lunged towards Osborne&rsquo;s left eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His Satan&rsquo;s Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, Osborne was unable to evade, and Milo&rsquo;s sharp claw instantly landed on his eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But in the next second, a piercing scream resounded. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon touching Osborne&rsquo;s Satan&rsquo;s Eye, Milo&rsquo;s hand seemed to be shocked, causing his body to tremble violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The purple light in his eyes quickly vanished, his skin wrinkling as if he had aged ten years in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seconds later, Milo shoved Osborne away, his eyes filled with terror and fear, no longer concerned with killing Osborne, frantically fleeing outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne, astonished, had no idea what had just occurred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, his concern for Anastasia prevented him from giving chase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Milo about to escape, a tall figure suddenly appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was Isa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa stood in the way of Milo&rsquo;s escape route, her expression incredibly cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Get lost!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Milo, crazed, threw a punch at Isa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was instantly alarmed, shouting, &ldquo;Isa, move aside quickly. He&rsquo;s a metahuman, his strength is formidable, don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
