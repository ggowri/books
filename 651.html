  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is the origin of the light elemental essence that Isa gave me? Why is it so powerful? Why is it so high in level? And why is there a special force that restrains most of its power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't figure it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he struggled to fuse it into Devil's Light, his mauve level seven light transformed from deep purple to black, ultimately becoming a pure black that could devour light itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black was the color of the eighth level Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the fusion wasn't ended because Osborne's light element essence had not yet completely fused into Devil's Light and was still improving its level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, amidst the extreme blackness, the Devil's Light transformed again, becoming completely transparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this?" Osborne wondered, surprised but focused on continuing the fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt immense pressure on his body. Cracks appeared on his skin, bleeding as they expanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the pain, he pressed on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he turned into a bloody man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't go on like this. If I continue to fuse, my body will inevitably collapse. I must continue to improve my physical fitness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and activated his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used his ocular energy to frantically capture the star power and devour it. Every time he devoured a bit of star power, his body would become a little stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was far from enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth. Normally, he could only capture star power within a radius of several dozen yards, absorbing more would freeze his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to prevent his body from collapsing, he disregarded the freezing effects and </span><span>frantically absorbed star power from a radius of hundreds or even thousands of feet, devouring it as if his life depended on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, his body quickly became encased in ice, but the cracks that had plagued him finally ceased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the effect, Osborne intensified his efforts to absorb star power, aiming to enhance his physical fitness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, time passed slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While ordinary elemental essences typically fused into Devil's Light within minutes, Osborne took three full days to fuse the light elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During these three days, his body threatened to break apart repeatedly, but his desperate absorption of star power kept him intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, the fusion was complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Devil's Light remained colorless and transparent, yet its energy fluctuations astonished even him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a powerful Devil's Light!" he marveled. "Is it still at level 8?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An eighth-level Devil's Light had never been seen before, and the potent light elemental essence had caused remarkable mutations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was unsure of its exact level but felt confident in its strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He controlled the Devil's Light and reintegrated it into his martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint reddish aura enveloped him, and though still at Class AA, the aura was significantly stronger than just days prior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had this martial art aura a few days ago, Duke Medusa's petrification power would have been no threat. Her attacks wouldn't have harmed me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, I have been consuming a lot of star power these days, and my body has become stronger and my strength has become greater. Now, even if I still can't beat Duke Medusa, I am definitely capable of fighting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "This power keeps me safe from Duke Medusa, but defeating her is still a challenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must have more means!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, he resolved to enhance his major power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had many major abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had previously suggested he focus on spatial, thunder, and psychic power, which Osborne agreed with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that time, he didn't have the dark power and light elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he recognized the importance of dark and light elemental power, especially the light elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His light elemental essence was exceptionally powerful, allowing him to effortlessly master two intermediate uses of light elemental powers, Dissolving Light and Light of Redemption.</span></p><div class="pagination">
