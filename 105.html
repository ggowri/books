  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captain Barlyn..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't call me Captain Barlyn, it's too formal. You're Clarissa's savior, my savior, just call me by my name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Alright then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a low voice, he asked, "Barlyn, Ms. Donna Radcliffe froze your credit cards? You became the head of the security team to make money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is really strict with you, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn sighed, "Tell me about it. Sometimes, I even doubt if I'm really her biological son. Life is tough, you know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"People think I'm a rich playboy from an ancient family, living a life of luxury, driving fancy cars, dating supermodels and celebrities. But that's not true at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just like to drink, but my mom controls my finances. Now, if I want a drink, I have to shamelessly ask you to treat me. How pathetic is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After expressing his thoughts, Barlyn looked hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback by his words and couldn't help but feel a bit sympathetic towards Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This is indeed a tough situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it might be beneficial for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Barlyn only became the head of Clarissa's security team because he needed money, would he quit if he had money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But giving him money directly is out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Barlyn would suspect my motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I must help Barlyn make money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some thought, Osborne said, "Barlyn, drinking is not a problem, but there's no rush. I'm about to do something to make money, it's a bit risky and I'm not very confident about it. How strong are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's eyes lit up at his words. "I'm pretty strong. I may not be as powerful as my mom, but I'm at least a Class C earth elemental metahuman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well then, that's settled! With your help, I'll have a shot at success. Want to join me for a big score? If we succeed, I'll split the earnings with you, three to seven!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was completely intrigued, asking, "Three to seven? How much is that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what exactly are we doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "I'm not entirely sure about the amount, but at least tens of millions? And if it's less than 100 million dollars, I'll make up the difference for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"100 million?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's eyes widened in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm in! Count me in! With 100 million, I won't have to worry about my mom freezing my credit cards anymore. Haha, Osborne, you're my bro now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was beyond excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was speechless, thinking, "Just the promise of 100 million has gotten Barlyn, the scion of an ancient family, this excited. How strict can Donna really be with him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even heirs like Ophelia and Wesley aren't affected like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what are we doing exactly? To make 100 million? I can't wait, let's get moving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was eager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Don't rush, we'll talk as we go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them left the Radcliffe Manor side by side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to them, in a distant attic, Donna frowned tightly as she watched the two of them leave shoulder to shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is Barlyn so excited about? Is Osborne leading him to do something nefarious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, hearing this, couldn't bear it and retorted, "Aunt Donna, why do you think it's Osborne leading Barlyn into trouble, and not the other way around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna sneered, saying, "Because Barlyn doesn't have money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was speechless and somewhat helpless, but she had a hint of empathy for Barlyn deep in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I trust Osborne, he wouldn't do anything bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna turned and stared at Clarissa seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said sternly, "Clarissa, even though Osborne saved you multiple times, you must not develop feelings for him! You should know the huge gap in your identities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was taken aback and bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I won't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna said calmly, "It's better if you don't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know why I chose Barlyn to be your head bodyguard instead of Osborne to replace Paul?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa asked curiously, "Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, Osborne has saved me three times already. You should know that he would never harm me. Why do you still distrust him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna furrowed her brow and replied, "I do believe now that Osborne wouldn't hurt you. My issue is that I still don't understand why he's protecting you so fiercely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, Osborne doesn't need money. The amount we could offer him wouldn't be enough to explain why he's going to such extremes for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's his real motivation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only explanation is that he's pursuing you, trying to win you over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face flushed red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wh... what? That's impossible! We've already asked him before, and he denied it. Plus, my meta-ability tells me he wasn't lying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's voice faltered as she spoke, her eyes betraying a hint of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna, however, remained serious. "Clarissa, your ability to detect lies isn't infallible. Remember? Paul managed to lie right to your face for a long time, and you didn't catch on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was taken aback, and then a flicker of realization crossed her face.</span></p><div class="pagination">
