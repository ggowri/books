  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp voice rang out, cutting through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a middle-aged woman appeared, her gaze fixed on Osborne with an icy intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne halted, turning to face her. Searching through Lachlan's memories, he realized this woman was no ordinary figure&mdash;her name was Tiana Hart, a high-ranking official in the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had the authority to make decisions regarding everything that went on there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to top it off, she belonged to the Soaring Lion Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In essence, she was the one pulling the strings in Wild Flame City's slave market. While her power wasn't the highest, she was still a Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celestial Deity, huh?" Osborne murmured, but he didn't feel the slightest bit intimidated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued to grip Lillian's neck, locking eyes with Tiana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let her go, now!" Tiana commanded, her voice cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "Let her go? Why should I? She provoked me and sent her goons after me. There's no way I'm just going to let that slide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian, sensing the shift, quickly interjected, "Ms. Tiana Hart, I didn't do anything! It was Lachlan who started this mess! He struck first! You have to do something&mdash;he's with the Swift family from the Human Community. You can't let him get away with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana's eyes flashed with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her view, the Swift family was nothing but a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, the entire Human Community was a lowly race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sneer, she replied, "Lachlan, is it? I'm giving you three seconds to release her. She's an employee of the slave market, and if you dare to harm her, you'd better beg for mercy and call your grandfather. Maybe then we can sort this out. Otherwise, you might want to start preparing for your funeral."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tiana began her countdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian's eyes sparkled with a mix of excitement and contempt for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, then slammed Lillian down onto the ground with a forceful thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian hadn't expected Osborne to go through with it. The impact of her head hitting the hard floor was brutal, and she let out a scream, blood gushing from her mouth as she lost consciousness, her body going limp like a rag doll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wiped his hands clean, turning to the stunned Tiana with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I've dropped her within your three-second window."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana snapped back to reality, her eyes burning with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this how you're supposed to drop her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "If not like this, then how? You didn't exactly clarify! But I think this works just fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana's rage escalated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it! To be this brazen in the slave market&mdash;do you really think even your grandfather Walter could save you now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved to strike, but Osborne raised a hand, an amused smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on a second. Ms. Tiana Hart, I'm a major client of the slave market, even a VIP. Wouldn't you want to diffuse my anger instead of escalating it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shouldn't you be looking to fire these disrespectful fools?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should have the right to do so, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana paused, momentarily taken aback. Then she scoffed. "That's a joke! Real VIP clients certainly have the right to discipline a few disrespectful idiots. But you? A pathetic member of the Human Community? You think you're a VIP here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I am?" Osborne replied with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana retorted, "Impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As the manager, I know all the details about our VIP clients. There are a few from the Human Community, but none of them are you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged again. "I may not be one yet, but I will be soon! I came here today to spend big, and by the end of this, I'll be a VIP client for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words hung in the air, and Tiana burst into laughter, her voice sharp and mocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even know what you're talking about? You think you'll be a VIP client here after today? Do you have any idea what it takes to earn that title? I won't even get into the other requirements, but the minimum spending threshold? You'll never reach it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm smile, Osborne replied, "Oh really? Why don't you enlighten me? How much do I need to spend to qualify as a VIP here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana narrowed her eyes, scrutinizing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His demeanor was unnervingly composed, radiating confidence that made her second-guess herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he stalling for someone to rescue him, or does he genuinely intend to drop a fortune in Essence Crystals to become a VIP?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it's the latter, I need to think this through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't be worth offending a potential VIP client over a mere sales rep and a few security guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he's just playing games, I'll make sure he regrets it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana leaned in closer, her voice dripping with cold determination. "Listen up. Here's your chance. If you can actually become a VIP client today, I'll overlook everything you've done. I'll even fire those who disrespected you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you can't pull it off? Even if your grandfather Walter himself shows up, you'll be dead meat!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
