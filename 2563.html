  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop! Stop now!" Primordial was extremely anxious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He merged with Osborne's Soul Current Ocean. At this moment, Osborne's Soul Current Ocean was shaking violently, producing sounds like a tsunami.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed that Osborne's Soul Current Ocean was about to crack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Soul Current Ocean was protected by the Primordial Mark. Primordial had previously mentioned that Osborne's Soul Current Ocean was extremely sturdy, so much so that even a warrior at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level would find it hard to break through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, due to the cracking of Satan's Eye, Osborne's Soul Current Ocean was also about to split.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, not only was Osborne's Soul Current Ocean about to crack, but his body was also on the verge of breaking apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those Primordial Marks could no longer protect Osborne's Soul Current Ocean and body because Satan's Eye was also a part of Osborne's body, and the most crucial part at that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Satan's Eye cracks, Osborne's body will also break apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, fortunately, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity in Osborne's heart was operating frantically, repairing Osborne's cracked body cells through its dense roots.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, Osborne's body would have collapsed long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop now!" Primordial urged anxiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne seemed unable to hear him at this moment. Osborne had only one obsession now: to find out who had destroyed Michelle's tomb and remains, who wouldn't even spare the dead, digging Michelle's remains out of the tomb and leveling the entire site.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could not accept this and could not forgive the person who did it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were filled with killing intent and obsession as he frantically pushed Satan's Eye to its limits. At this moment, Osborne's obsession reached its peak. Even if it meant losing Satan's Eye, he would not give up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nine hundred and fifty years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nine hundred and eighty years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One thousand years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Time Retrace had already shown Osborne what happened a thousand years ago. By now, Osborne truly felt the limits of Satan's Eye. His Satan's Eye was covered in countless cracks. The pain made him unable to hold back a roar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew that if he continued to push Satan's Eye, it would shatter instantly, and his body would collapse immediately as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, even the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity might not be able to restore the shattered Satan's Eye and his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne refused to stop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time had already been traced back a thousand years, yet he still saw nothing&mdash;no sight of Michelle's tomb or remains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This indicated that Michelle's tomb had been leveled a thousand years ago, and her remains had been dug up a thousand years ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that time, Michelle had only been buried for a hundred years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A hundred years is nothing to a warrior. Any warrior at Empyrean Sacredness can live tens of thousands of years, or even longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Michelle had only been buried in the Royal Sepulcher for a hundred years before her remains were dug up and her tomb leveled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a thing had never happened before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne refused to give up because if he traced back another hundred years, it would be the time when Michelle was buried. By then, he would surely see who had dug up Michelle's tomb and taken her remains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth and growled softly, "I can't stop. Satan's Eye, you must keep tracing back time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amid his roar, Satan's Eye was also summoning its power, seemingly trying to break through the thousand-year barrier. However, it simply couldn't. Instead, a sharper cracking sound echoed. The scene Osborne was watching had already shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was because Satan's Eye had already shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop right now!" Primordial said anxiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Satan's Eye shattered, Primordial felt that Osborne's Soul Current Ocean had also reached its limit and started to break apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a crack, the barrier of Osborne's Soul Current Ocean actually split open.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the terrifying soul power leaked out through the cracks. Once it all escapes, Osborne's soul will dissipate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that happens, even if Primordial and the Warfare Ancient Tree, which are fused with Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, don't perish, they will inevitably suffer severe damage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's over! Everything is over!" At this moment, Primordial fell into despair. "He's completely lost it. Who the hell destroyed Osborne's mother's tomb and remains? If I find out who it is, I will kill them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial gave up struggling because there was no solution to such a problem in his memory. Now, even if Osborne stops, he will still suffer severe damage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After suffering such terrible injuries, Osborne's body could never recover. Perhaps Osborne's cultivation level will forever remain at Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, never able to reach Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's future is ruined!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne's obsession was too strong. He was still trying to reverse time at this moment. Next, not only would Osborne's future be destroyed, but Osborne would also die!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial couldn't think of any way to save Osborne in such a situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't dissolve Osborne's obsession unless Osborne could see in the Time Retrace who exactly destroyed Michelle's tomb and remains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's over! Completely over!" Primordial said in despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial sensed a faint energy fluctuation. A peculiar bug appeared on Osborne's other shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This bug had eight legs, six eyes, dozens of wings, a single horn on its head, and an incredibly sharp proboscis.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum appeared!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne's condition, Drum was equally anxious. Her six eyes were filled with mist, seemingly tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She kept flapping her wings, looking extremely anxious. But she could do nothing because she was still in her infancy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, upon seeing Drum, Primordial couldn't help but get excited and quickly shouted, "Drum, go find your mother. Right now, maybe only your mother can save Osborne."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Drum immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, she disappeared from Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, within Osborne's heart, aside from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity desperately working to heal Osborne's injuries, a transparent war drum gradually became clearer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the Drum of Empress Kira.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Drum lay on the Drum of Empress Kira, anxiously tapping the drumhead with her eight legs, her expression extremely worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, the Drum of Empress Kira showed a slight change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The patterns on the drumhead began to emit light, which eventually converged at the very center.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the phantom of a beautiful woman appeared in front of Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This woman was naturally Empress Kira, the former Master of the cosmos, the invincible queen of the Bug Clan, the strongest Sovereign Master!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empress Kira looked at Drum, her eyes filled with affection and helplessness. "Drum, why did you wake me up? Didn't I tell you to stay with Osborne? I'm still recovering."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, Empress Kira's expression changed. "He's simply being reckless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shouted sternly, "Do you have a death wish? If you want to die, I can grant it. Why are you committing suicide? Do you want to harm my daughter? You're such a bastard."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empress Kira's expression was icy cold. After sensing Osborne's physical condition, she was extremely furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, let's go. I'll find you a new father. This foolish bastard is courting death." Saying this, Empress Kira held Drum tightly, ready to leave.</span></p><div class="pagination">
