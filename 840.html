  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne continued forward, pulling out various divine artifacts from Dimensional Space.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since he was about to face a genuine deity, he knew he had to be thoroughly prepared. Even though the deity was currently injured and weakened, Osborne needed to ensure he had everything he might need for the battle.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted to be ready in case his spatial abilities were restricted during the fight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly reviewed the artifacts he had.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Goddess of Grain's scythe was a prize from the Godfather after a bet with the Rosenthal family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Axe of Strength was a trophy from defeating Luca.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Volt Hammer came from his victory over Cuthbert at the Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Thundergod Gloves were compensation from the Williamson family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Rock Smasher, once Cuthbert's weapon, was taken after his defeat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, he had an ancient blade from his victory over Abner.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Out of these six artifacts, four had come from the Williamson family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Seems like the Williamson family is quite generous," Osborne mused.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to Isa, ancient artifacts were classified into ordinary, premium, top, and supreme grades.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Goddess of Grain's scythe might be a premium artifact. Its sharpness and durability are impressive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It once sliced through another artifact cleanly. It could be very useful against Dark Deity's defenses. I'll definitely keep it ready."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne strapped the Goddess of Grain's scythe to his side.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Thundergod Gloves and the Volt Hammer are a matched set. When used together, they're among the top-grade artifacts.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They'll be my main weapons against Dark Deity."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He put on the Thundergod Gloves and gripped the Volt Hammer firmly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, he considered the divine blade.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This blade was Abner's and is only an ordinary artifact. It's not very powerful and won't be much help in this fight."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stored the divine blade back in Dimensional Space.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, his attention turned to the Axe of Strength and the Rock Smasher.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Axe of Strength is one of the three axes of Hermes. Although it's the weakest of the three, it's still a premium artifact that significantly boosts my strength and enhances my attacks.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And the Rock Smasher, Cuthbert's weapon, also a premium artifact, has similar effects.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Which one should I pick?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ultimately, he chose the Rock Smasher.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Given the narrow confines of the dungeon, the massive Axe of Strength might be cumbersome, while the slender Rock Smasher could be wielded effectively even in tight spaces.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He also strapped his super energy pistol to his waist, ensuring he was fully equipped.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the Axe of Strength in his right hand, the Thundergod Gloves and the Volt Hammer in his left, and the Goddess of Grain's scythe at his side, he proceeded deeper into the dungeon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With four ancient artifacts on him, all of them fine or even superior grade, his arsenal was impressive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyone else would be awestruck and envious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne felt no confidence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His opponent was a genuine deity, a malevolent one at that.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking a deep breath, Osborne steeled himself. "I've done everything I can. If I can't win like this, I'll have to retreat."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He arrived at a stone door, and his Satan's Eye began to pulse erratically.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt an ominous presence behind the door, indicating Dark Deity was waiting for him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne tried to use his Satan's Eye to peer through the door, but to his surprise, its penetrating vision was blocked by a powerful barrier.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Divine power?" Osborne's face tightened in concern.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to see through the door, he hesitated for a moment, then quickly shook off the delay.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't afford to waste time. If he faltered, Kendra and Yulissa would be in danger. He couldn't forgive himself if they were killed because of his hesitation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Osborne reached the stone door.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, he pushed it open with the Rock Smasher.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The door creaked open, revealing a spacious chamber.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And there, before him, stood Dark Deity.</p><div class="pagination">
