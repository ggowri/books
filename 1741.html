  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle between Osborne and Aldrich was nothing short of fierce, but it was clear that Osborne was on the defensive, struggling against the overwhelming power of Aldrich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the crowd's astonishment at Osborne's impressive display, no one truly believed he could win; it was only a matter of time before Aldrich would claim victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated by his inability to defeat Osborne, Aldrich's fury escalated, his attacks becoming more brutal with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, Osborne's divine power shield shattered under the relentless assault, and the terrifying force slammed into his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Osborne felt the sting of injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich's eyes lit up with a cruel glimmer. "Well, well, you do have some skill. No wonder you dare to call yourself one of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! If you were allowed to grow, you might actually become a formidable figure like them&mdash;a real headache for us all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're too foolish. With your talent, you should be hiding away, honing your skills. Instead, you come out to challenge me? It's like you're asking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A dead genius is worth nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I'll personally end your life and eliminate this future threat! You and your so-called 'Seven Young Deity Kings' will be wiped from existence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Aldrich stood tall, a picture of arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced down at his injuries, recognizing that Aldrich, a mid-stage Deity King, was indeed far stronger than Chandler. He had given it his all, yet Aldrich had still managed to wound him. Defeating Aldrich at his current level seemed impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One wrong move, and he could easily find himself dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was only the normal course of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Aldrich's arrogant proclamations, Osborne couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aldrich, what gives you the confidence that you can kill me? Just because you've hurt me? You're celebrating a bit too early!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Osborne focused his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity sprang to life, beginning to mend his wounds. In the blink of an eye, his injuries vanished, leaving no trace behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was back at the peak of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't done yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he had a new tactic, that is borrowing strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had spread through every Blood Clan member he had transformed. Whenever Osborne wished, he could draw power from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, that's exactly what he did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ranks of the Blood Clan had swelled significantly; they were no longer just the Blood Demon members. He had transformed over five thousand from the Spark of Blaze, Guy from the Wild Flame Army, and more than 10 thousand under his command, alongside Chandler, Angelo, and the 400 thousand soldiers from Divine Peak Nine base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of these were part of Osborne's Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with a thought, Osborne could siphon power from each of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if each individual contributed just a fraction of their strength, collectively, it would amount to an enormous, terrifying force, propelling Osborne's power to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne reached the pinnacle of the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt an overwhelming surge of power coursing through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he knew his movements couldn't stop there. Even as a peak Deity Overlord, he still couldn't afford to underestimate Aldrich, a mid-stage Deity King. Defeating Aldrich would still be a monumental challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he continued to draw strength from every Blood Clan member he had transformed, pushing himself even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying surge of power erupted from Osborne, sending shockwaves through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could feel it&mdash;his strength was skyrocketing, leaving them utterly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They struggled to comprehend what was happening, but one thing was clear. As Osborne's power continued to rise, the difficulty of dealing with him was increasing exponentially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! What kind of monster are you? How can your strength increase out of nowhere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed under his breath, but there was no time for answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep sense of foreboding settled in his gut; Aldrich instinctively knew that if he didn't finish Osborne off quickly, he would be in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Aldrich launched himself into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His next attack was even more ferocious than the last, clearly indicating that he was now fighting with everything he had, no longer underestimating his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich's fearsome assault descended like a storm, enveloping Osborne in an overwhelming wave of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above Osborne, it felt as if a massive black millstone had appeared, ready to crush him into oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure was palpable, and the onlookers felt it, too, their faces draining of color as they realized the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god! This is the true power of a mid-stage Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Aldrich Bowman wasn't even trying before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear, if that attack lands, Wild Flame City will be reduced to rubble! Every building, every person&mdash;crushed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd instinctively began to retreat, their shock evident as they watched the impending doom unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes flickered with a mix of fear and cold amusement as they gazed at Osborne, who stood at the center of the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavens themselves seemed to roar as Aldrich's devastating attack came crashing down!</span></p><div class="pagination">
