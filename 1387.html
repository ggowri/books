  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia were still getting used to having Osborne around. As they discussed their plans, they completely ignored his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne listened intently, gratitude washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that if it weren't for him, Harry and Amelia wouldn't be in such dire straits. Patrick and Vance wouldn't have had the opportunity to target them so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered to himself, a cold smile creeping onto his face, "Vance, huh? Amelia is my savior, and you want to make her your target?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better be ready for a fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Vance is an Intermediate Deity; I'm not strong enough to take him on </span><span>directly&mdash;not yet. I need to regain my strength before I can confront him head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For now, I'll just have to protect those two from the shadows."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined to keep an eye on Harry and Amelia as they risked their lives to gather the triple quota of Essence Crystals, Osborne decided to follow them into the depths of the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been there before and knew the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> still prowled those dark tunnels in significant numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't let anything happen to them; he needed to hunt more </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> to restore his Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne silently trailed behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept his distance; his space elemental essence had been severely damaged, preventing him from using spatial shifts to slip into parallel dimensions. Getting too close would be risky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Osborne still possessed dark elemental essence, which allowed him to remain hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He followed the siblings without being noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Harry and Amelia entered a cavern, showing no signs of hesitation as they headed deeper into the mine. They reached the end of the tunnel, glanced around to ensure they were alone, and then pushed aside a large stone. Behind it lay a narrow, dark passageway, barely tall enough for a person to crawl through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry, does this tunnel lead to the depths of the mine?" Amelia asked, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry nodded gravely, lost in memories. "This tunnel was left by our father. Back when he couldn't submit enough Essence Crystals, he risked everything to venture into the depths. It took him a lot of effort to dig out this passage, and it ultimately helped our family survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He always warned me to avoid using it unless absolutely necessary because the depths are perilous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, we have no choice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he could find enough Essence Crystals down there to save us, then we can too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination in his eyes, Harry stepped into the tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia followed suit, her resolve matching his. "We can do this!" she declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After entering, they pushed the stone back into place, sealing off the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the outside, no one would suspect that this small tunnel led to the depths of the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed and quickly followed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't enter the narrow passage. Instead, using his earth elemental power, he melded seamlessly into the surrounding rock, keeping a safe distance as he trailed the siblings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he felt a shift in energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Osborne's expression hardened as he turned back toward the entrance of the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, he sensed a faint energy fluctuation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone's coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, fixing it intently on the mine entrance they had come from. Soon, he spotted several furtive figures cautiously approaching the end of the tunnel. After some searching, they moved a large rock to reveal a hidden, small </span><span>mine</span><span> entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold voice broke the silence. "Hmph, they indeed have a secret passage into the deep mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened. The speaker was none other than Vance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance had followed them here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Vance's side stood several villagers from the Rodriguez Village, all subservient to Vance, their faces displaying obsequious smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! We'll tail them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The father of Harry and Amelia once had a sudden surge in power, clearly due to a large quantity of Essence Crystals. Back then, my father suspected their father must have known a secure way into the deep mine, which allowed him to acquire those crystals and return alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though my father never found that secret passage, this time, through my plan, I forced Patrick to demand triple the Essence Crystals from those siblings, pushing them to the brink. They finally had to use that secret passage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance's face was smug with self-satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "Let's move in and take care of those siblings! Once we have that secret passage, we'll rake in a fortune of Essence Crystals. We'll break through our limits rapidly, maybe even achieve Superior Deity status, automatically earning our overseer titles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, Amelia's quite a looker!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Later, I want her begging beneath me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
