  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was the only one in the Phantomagic Realm who broke free from the influence of the Supreme Bewitching Formation, and the only one who witnessed Dalia's cruel actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After witnessing Dalia effortlessly devour more than twenty Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors into dried corpses, Osborne felt a chill run through his entire body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, he clearly felt the powerful energy emanating from Dalia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia's cultivation level was not at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection as he had thought, but had reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She, like Adriana, was a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying part was that after absorbing the vital essence, soul power, and potential of more than twenty Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors, she became even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Osborne feel fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was completely unable to oppose Dalia. Even if his cultivation level reached Empyrean Sacredness, he would absolutely not be a match for Dalia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne always thought the mastermind's cultivation level was only at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. When facing an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior, Osborne believed that as long as he and Flash joined forces and gave it their all, they might still be able to hold their ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only needed to disrupt Dalia's plan, seize control of the Bewitching Lantern, and nullify the power of the Bewitching Formation. After that, he wouldn't need to take action himself&mdash;many warriors in the Phantomagic Realm, such as those over twenty warriors with cultivation levels reaching Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, would be able to tear Dalia to shreds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Dalia is a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, rendering Osborne's previous plan useless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even worse, those over twenty warriors with cultivation levels at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection were killed by Dalia immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne had regained consciousness by now, he didn&rsquo;t dare to make any move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Dalia discovered he was awake, those terrifying tentacles could easily pierce his defenses and drain him dry in no time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mr Osborne is thinking fast. "Shall I take control of the Bewitching Lantern now? The Bewitching Lantern has become so powerful from the Phantomagic Realm that if I can take control of the Bewitching Lantern and use the Bewitching Formation to influence Dalia, maybe I can turn things around! "</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold light flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Dalia did not stop. Her tentacles kept flailing, piercing through the bodies of warriors one by one, crazily devouring their vital essence and soul power, leaving them as dried corpses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection level couldn't withstand those tentacle attacks, let alone anyone else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could only watch, not daring to make any move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this rate, it might not be long before he becomes Dalia's target, gets his body pierced by the tentacles, and turns into a dried corpse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We have no other choice now!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can only forcibly seize control of the Bewitching Lantern! The Bewitching Lantern has absorbed the power of the Phantomagic Realm. Its Bewitching Formation is terrifyingly powerful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This guy may be a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, but if enveloped by the Bewitching Formation, she might not withstand it! However, all of this hinges on you seizing control of the Bewitching Lantern. If you fail, then prepare to face death!" Primordial said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's thoughts were exactly Osborne's thoughts. Osborne knew that if he continued like this, he was just waiting to die. At this moment, his only chance was to risk everything and fight Dalia for control of the Bewitching Lantern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne wasn't sure if he could succeed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Dalia were an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, Osborne would have a decent chance. After all, most of the Bewitching Lantern had already been tampered with by the Warfare Ancient Tree. Even if Osborne's cultivation level couldn't match Dalia's, he could rely on the advantage of numbers to seize control of the Bewitching Lantern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Dalia is a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no confidence in seizing control of the Bewitching Lantern from Dalia, as her cultivation level had reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he had no choice but to give it a try!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Even if we can't seize control, we must let the Warfare Ancient Tree suppress the Bewitching Lantern and render the Bewitching Formation ineffective! But even so, I still can't deal with Dalia. She will definitely hunt me down!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, his expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gritted his teeth, thinking, "I shouldn't be afraid! If I don't do this, I'm doomed! If I do, I only might die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This kind of choice doesn't even require thinking!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Warfare Ancient Tree, activate all Soulbrands left on the Bewitching Lantern!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt his Soulbrand activated. He sensed the presence of ninety Bewitching Lanterns and felt Dalia's Soulbrand on eighty-nine of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These are Dalia's Soulbrands, the key she uses to control the Bewitching Formation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as these Soulbrands are expelled, the Bewitching Lanterns will no longer be under Dalia's control. The power of the Bewitching Lanterns will then affect Dalia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia's Soulbrands have all been tampered with by the Warfare Ancient Tree; they&rsquo;ve already loosened!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t hesitate for a moment. Before Dalia could react, he immediately controlled his Soulbrand, attempting to clear Dalia&rsquo;s loosened Soulbrand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An invisible battle erupted among the eighty-nine Bewitching Lanterns. Osborne's Soulbrand was more stable, while Dalia's Soulbrand had already loosened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne and Dalia were equals, he would easily expel Dalia's Soulbrand and fully gain control of the Bewitching Lantern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, their strengths are not on the same level at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's cultivation level only reached Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, while Dalia's cultivation level had reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. There was a huge gap between their cultivation levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Were it not for the fact that Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, fused with Primordial and Warfare Ancient Tree, makes his soul power extra powerful, Osborne is not even in a position to fight Dalia for control of the Bewitching Lantern. All it took was a simple thought for Dalia to exorcise Osborne's Soulbrand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clearly knew the difficulty of his action this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Dalia's Soulbrand had loosened, Osborne struggled with all his might but still couldn't remove Dalia's Soulbrand. He had no way to seize control of the Bewitching Lantern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bad!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation shocked Osborne. He had underestimated Dalia's strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia's soul power was stronger than that of a typical Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne acted, Dalia immediately sensed something unusual. Shock appeared on her face, followed by anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! Someone actually tampered with my Bewitching Lantern, leaving a Soulbrand? Trying to expel my Soulbrand and seize control of the Bewitching Lantern?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! I don't care who you are, you're dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dream on if you want to steal my Bewitching Lantern! It's mine, and no one can take it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After angrily finishing her words, Dalia suddenly closed her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, Osborne felt an incredibly terrifying soul power surge into the eighty-nine Bewitching Lanterns, like a tide trying to expel his Soulbrand from them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's soul power was too weak in comparison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't hold it anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is absolutely impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's forehead was covered in sweat. Feeling his Soulbrand being rapidly expelled by Dalia, he sensed the breath of death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he failed to seize control of the Bewitching Lantern, Dalia would immediately pinpoint his location and kill him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I do now?!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
