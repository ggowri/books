  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about another bet? If I succeed, not only will you not stop me from pursuing Clarissa, but you'll also help create opportunities for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, causing Clarissa's face to redden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her face towards the window, pretending not to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna opened her mouth wide, coldly saying, "Let's bet. Anyway, there's no way you can win this time. I'll give you a budget of 500 million dollars. If you can close the deal with that, I'll help you pursue Clarissa from now on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you fail, stay away from Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal," Osborne agreed without hesitation, smiling. "Wait outside for good news from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne pushed open the car door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I want to go with you," Clarissa quickly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn also chimed in, "Osborne, I'm coming too. No matter what, I'm on your side. I support you unconditionally." Osborne was taken aback, feeling a bit troubled. "How can I negotiate with Valentin when Clarissa and Barlyn are around? Do I have to reveal my identity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's all go then." Donna made the decision. All four got out of the car and returned to Skyefall Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deputy manager of Skyefall Security, Judith, saw them and frowned, asking. Her attitude towards them was far from the enthusiasm she showed Apollo, even cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such differential treatment made them a bit angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of them spoke, instead looking towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Since Osborne is so confident, he should handle the negotiations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "We'd like to discuss the rental of the Class A defense system with Valentin again. Please inform him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith sneered, waving her hand casually as if shooing them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're not renting to you. Leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna and the others' faces changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn couldn't help but say, "Watch your tone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith snorted coldly, "What's wrong with my tone? If you feel offended, then leave, don't disturb my work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are, Mr. Chevalier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was so angry his body trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never been insulted like this in his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You motherf..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barlyn, shut up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna stopped Barlyn from cursing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fox, isn't that going too far? After all, my family has had a long-term partnership with Skyefall Security. We still hire over twenty of your professional bodyguards at high prices."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Judith sneered again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what? You hire our professional bodyguards because you need them, not because I begged you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm in a bad mood right now. Don't cause trouble here, or don't blame me for kicking you out. Do you think I don't know about the Radcliffe family's situation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith looked at them with disdain and provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna clenched her fists, her face full of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't understand why Judith was willing to fawn over Apollo but treated them so badly. Didn't Judith fear offending the Radcliffe family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Judith really wasn't afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that after Valentin offended the Chevalier family, Skyefall Security was doomed to be squeezed and might even go bankrupt soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Judith had already considered her escape route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She decided to go over to Apollo. Just moments ago, she made contact with him. She said she was willing to work for Apollo, staying as a mole within Skyefall Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's first task for her was to stir up conflict between Skyefall Security and the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was humiliated and wanted Donna and the others to lose face, too, to vent his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Judith treated them so poorly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna couldn't figure it out, but Osborne guessed what happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Judith, the deputy manager of Skyefall Security, right? I think your career is about to end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith chuckled, "Who are you? Can you fire me? Or can you predict the future? What a joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm waiting. Let's see who will fire me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith was full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took out his phone and sent a text to Valentin, then said, "Just consider me a fortune teller. Soon, you'll be kicked out, no longer the deputy manager. If you don't believe me, just wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha..." Judith laughed again, looking at Osborne as if he were a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a tall and burly figure rushed over in a hurry. It was Skyefall Security's general manager, Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From afar, Valentin shouted loudly, "Judith, you dumbass. You're fired, pack up, and get lost."</span></p><div class="pagination">
