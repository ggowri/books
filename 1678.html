  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The patrol teams trailing Angelo and his group quickly realized that their quarry was picking up the pace. They immediately reached out to other nearby patrols for reinforcements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, dozens of patrol squads descended from all directions, closing in on Angelo and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Angelo figured it out, they had no hope of slipping away quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened as he surveyed their perilous situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barked, determination lacing his voice, "All right, everyone! Get ready to fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This mission has already gone south. We're less than 600 miles from Celestial Crystal Mine, but we can't reach it now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our priority is getting out of here alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to take out every Deathborn patrol around us as fast as we can. If we can distance ourselves from their encirclement, we might have a shot at survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, we're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words struck dread into the hearts of Edison and the others, leaving their faces pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged worried glances, and fear tightened around their throats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you just standing there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get to it!" Angelo shouted, and his frustration boiled over as he launched into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His experience told him that with several patrols closing in, they had no choice but to fight their way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reacting quickly, he knew that the moment the Deathborn patrols spotted them, Deathborn King would have been notified and would be on his way in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to break free fast and get as far away as they could before the overwhelming forces of Deathborn converged around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Angelo unleashed his power, praying silently that their location was far enough from Deathborn Kingdom so they could escape before the King arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo revealed his full strength, targeting one of the Deathborn patrols directly in front of him. Ten Deity Overlord-level Deathborn were instantly caught in the snare of his terrifying mind control, their bodies twisting grotesquely under his will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Head this way!" he commanded, leading the group to distance themselves from the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luck was on Angelo's side as he chose a direction that led them away from Deathborn Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their freedom was short-lived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just minutes later, Osborne sensed an overwhelming force rapidly approaching. Alarmed, he looked up and spotted a colossal bird soaring through the air, hurtling toward Angelo with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer velocity of it shocked Osborne. It could rival even the Supreme Malevolence Airship in its haste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Deity King-level Deathborn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deathborn King is coming!" he exclaimed, and awe was mixed with dread flooding his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated the King's arrival would be this swift. In the blink of an eye, the Deathborn's true form&mdash;a massive eagle&mdash;was upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo felt the disturbance in the air and turned to see the chaos unfold behind him. His face drained of color as the gravity of their situation hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is bad! Deathborn King is chasing us. He didn't even bother to rally the army. He's come alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's brow furrowed deeply in concentration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, Edison's anxiety escalated, the menacing presence of Deathborn King sending shivers down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should we do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should we split up and flee?" Edison suggested, and panic creeped into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo shot Edison a cold glare. "Split up and run? Do you think Deathborn King is going to target me first? Do you want me to distract him while you all make a break for it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a nice plan, but it's not happening. Let me make this clear. If anyone tries to escape without my permission, I won't hesitate to take them down myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, as for the situation..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce glint flashed in Angelo's eyes. "Deathborn King is coming after us alone, and that might just be our chance! If he had brought the entire Deathborn army, even I would be scrambling to escape instead of engaging in a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But since he's come by himself, if we can take him out, we'll solve all our problems. Without Deathborn King, Deathborn Kingdom wouldn't seem so terrifying anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We could wipe out the entire kingdom and then head straight to Celestial Crystal Mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement lit up Angelo's gaze as he spoke. Just moments ago, he had thought their mission was doomed, that their chance to obtain the Celestial Crystal had slipped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, hope flickered back to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move! If we can take down Deathborn King before the rest of his forces arrive, not only will we survive, but we'll also secure Celestial Crystal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Angelo's words, the group's spirits lifted slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But doubts lingered in the air. Was taking down Deathborn King really that easy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a piercing cry echoed overhead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn King had arrived. His massive form shrunk down to a human shape, and cold eyes locked onto Angelo with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You filthy outsiders! How dare you invade my Deathborn Kingdom and slaughter my people? I will offer your flesh and blood as a sacrifice to the great lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn King's voice boomed, sending chills down their spines.</span></p><div class="pagination">
