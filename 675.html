  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne listened to the shouts of the crowd, he felt his blood boiling and excitement overwhelming him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His own organization, the Blood Demon Organization, was born!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All its members possessed vampire transformation powers and were under his complete control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the cheers subsided, Osborne waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All right! Keep training and familiarize yourselves with your newfound power as soon as possible! Tomorrow, we will launch a counterattack in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> according to plan! This will be your first battle, and I hope you can demonstrate the power that will shock the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Osborne with great enthusiasm, their eyes full of admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled lightly and held Clarissa's hand as they left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa kept turning her head back to look at the more than five hundred members of the Blood Demon, her eyes filled with astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the training hall, Clarissa finally turned to look at Osborne's profile, her eyes filled with tenderness and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She vividly remembered that several months ago, when she first met Osborne, he was just an ordinary person. At that time, he had just divorced due to pressure from Ophelia and wanted to join her bodyguard team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, although Osborne had some strength, Clarissa didn't take him seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it had only been a few months!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already grown so much, not only personally killing five Class AAA top fighters but also establishing the Blood Demon, a combat force consisting of over five hundred Class A or above masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa knew that the Blood Demon would eventually shock the world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne would also shock the world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is my man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa whispered to herself, and a hint of pride appeared on her perfect face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tightly hugged Osborne's arm and returned to their room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't do anything to Clarissa again because he didn't want her to exert herself too much. He silently began his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to capture the star power, improving his body and soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Osborne continued to comprehend the power of thunder, hoping to master an attack that was even more powerful than Thunder Explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, Osborne gradually felt that his understanding of thunder became more profound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a flash of inspiration appeared in his mind, as fast as lightning, but Osborne quickly grasped it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder of Judgment?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, suddenly mobilizing the power of thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of terrifying lightning instantly appeared as a deep purple beam of light, descending straight down and hitting a space in Osborne's courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This lightning was incredibly eerie, not only extremely fast but also silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't require any buildup of power. Instead, it simply fell suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like a divine judgment from the God upon mortals who had offended it. The spot where the Thunder of Judgment struck became empty, leaving behind a pitch-black cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cave was about three yards wide and over a hundred yards deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was alarmed immediately. He instantly appeared in front of Osborne, holding the Fate Staff and spreading her Divine and Demonic Wings to protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression turned extremely grave as she thought that Osborne was under attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb, Janet, No. 1, and others were also alerted</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all appeared quickly and gasped as they looked at the charred cave that was a hundred yards deep in Osborne's yard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne coughed awkwardly. "It's okay! Don't be nervous, people. There's no enemy attack. I'm just testing a new move. You can all go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, everyone was even more shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they didn't say anything. They took a deep look at the charred cave before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, only Clarissa remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was amazed. "Osborne, were you really testing your strength? Did you make that cave? I feel like even my Divine and Demonic Wings might not be able to withstand such an attack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa hugged Osborne's arm and said with a smile, "Osborne, you're really amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed her head and said, "You don't need to flatter me. I still have a long way to go. Although this attack is powerful, it won't be easy to kill a Class AAA fighter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought about the effects of Thunder of Judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of power, the Thunder of Judgment definitely surpassed the Thunder Explosion. Even compared to Space Collapse, it wasn't much weaker. Therefore, it would be, without a doubt, his new trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Thunder of Judgement didn't require any power buildup. It could appear instantly, and its speed was fast, making it difficult to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the attack range of the Thunder of Judgment was not large.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It only had a range of three yards for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if a Class AAA enemy were hit head-on by Thunder of Judgment, he would be severely injured and killed in a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he would be able to evade it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be easy for him to dodge with a range of three yards.</span></p><div class="pagination">
