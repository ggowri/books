  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna frowned but ultimately said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s a misunderstanding, let&rsquo;s disperse. These are critical times; our priority must be to protect Clarissa. Osborne, you&rsquo;ll temporarily join the fourth bodyguard unit under Deputy Captain Violet&rsquo;s command.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Deputy Captain Violet, you will be responsible for Osborne&rsquo;s specific duties.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Violet nodded with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna left with Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But before leaving, Osborne felt as if Clarissa had secretly glanced at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not thinking much of it, Osborne walked over to Violet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Deputy Captain Violet, Osborne reporting for duty.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet smiled slightly and patted Osborne on the shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got guts. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve seen someone dare to confront Captain Paul like that.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I was just defending myself.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet shook her head and said seriously, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve thoroughly offended Captain Paul. Your days in the Radcliffe family won&rsquo;t be easy from now on. But don&rsquo;t worry too much. Since you&rsquo;re in my fourth bodyguard unit, I&rsquo;ll look after you and make sure no one bullies you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sincerely expressed his gratitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back. These are special times, and we have no rest. We must always be ready to protect Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s safety.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Violet led her team to follow Clarissa&rsquo;s group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The fourth bodyguard unit, including Osborne, had ten members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were directly under Deputy Captain Violet&rsquo;s command, and all the members were from Skyefall Security Services. Among them, Osborne saw a new member who joined with him&mdash;Sherry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Are you all from Skyefall Security Services?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was quite surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet smiled. &ldquo;Is that so strange? Skyefall Security Services is the top security company in Skyefall. Ms. Radcliffe has a good partnership with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Not only the fourth bodyguard unit, but the entire third bodyguard unit, including Deputy Captain Sharon, are from Skyefall Security Services.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The second bodyguard unit members come from various top security companies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;And the first bodyguard unit and the personal guard team are all Paul&rsquo;s loyal followers. Paul&rsquo;s influence and strength are the greatest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Although you&rsquo;re not from Skyefall Security Services, now that you&rsquo;re in my fourth bodyguard unit, you&rsquo;re one of us. We won&rsquo;t let Paul bully you easily.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After hearing this, Osborne felt a bit happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Skyefall Security Services was owned by the Godfather and was a subsidiary of the Draco Group, which might become his business in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking about this, Osborne became even more enthusiastic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;By the way, how did you get into a conflict with Captain Paul?&rdquo; Violet asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other members of the fourth bodyguard unit were also curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shrugged. &ldquo;Maybe because I suspected him of being a traitor in front of Ms. Radcliffe and Ms. Donna yesterday, which made him very angry.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet was stunned for a moment and then laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You suspected Captain Paul of being a traitor? Captain Paul is different from us. We&rsquo;re all professional bodyguards hired to protect Ms. Radcliffe, but Captain Paul is a trusted confidant raised by the Radcliffe family since childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He has been with the Radcliffe family for decades and even protected the old master of the Radcliffe family. He is a veteran of the Radcliffe family. While we might be traitors, Paul definitely isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was taken aback. &ldquo;No wonder Ms. Donna and Ms. Radcliffe trust him so much. He was raised by the Radcliffe family.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Good that you understand.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet shrugged. &ldquo;Recently, Ms. Radcliffe has faced three large-scale attacks, and it was very dangerous. We weren&rsquo;t around to protect her, but thanks to Captain Paul and Ms. Donna, Ms. Radcliffe was safe.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He seemed to have caught onto something and hurriedly asked, &ldquo;Captain, you said Ms. Radcliffe was attacked three times, and you weren&rsquo;t there to protect her? Only Captain Paul was?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet nodded. &ldquo;Yes, we were either off-duty or on other assignments.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A sharp light flashed in Osborne&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa had been attacked three times, and the three deputy captains were all absent? Osborne didn&rsquo;t believe it was a coincidence; it seemed more like a deliberate arrangement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He recalled Paul&rsquo;s behavior during Clarissa&rsquo;s attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had felt that Paul, as the captain of the bodyguard unit, hadn&rsquo;t protected Clarissa well enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That was why he suspected Paul of being a traitor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, he was even more suspicious of Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I must keep a close watch on him</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A cold light flashed in Osborne&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not long after, Osborne noticed Paul leaving. He quickly claimed he was going to the restroom and then moved to a secluded corner to use his Satan&rsquo;s Eye, a clairvoyant ability, to locate Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, Osborne found Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul was in a room, seemingly on a video call with someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A cold light burst forth in Osborne&rsquo;s eyes.</p><div class="pagination">
