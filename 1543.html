  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, hiding in the parallel dimension, felt a wave of dread wash over him as he realized that the shadowy figure was staring directly at him, its gaze piercing through the veil of his hiding place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can he see me while I'm in this parallel space?" Osborne thought, furrowing his brow in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, he shifted his position, but to his horror, no matter how he moved, the figure's gaze followed him with unnerving precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revelation left him utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he encountered a presence that could track him even in the safety of a parallel dimension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More accurately, it wasn't even a person; it was merely a fraction of Lord Malevolence's power, a minuscule remnant left within Tobey's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, this insignificant fragment had the ability to detect him hiding in the parallel space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt a cold sweat trickling down his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had always known Lord Malevolence was formidable&mdash;after all, he had wiped out over ninety percent of the Human Community upon his arrival in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a testament to his power that even in a weakened state, he had fought against the seven most powerful Deity Kings of the Human Community, nearly bringing </span><span>Celestara</span><span> to its knees before being injured and sealed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence was undoubtedly the most powerful warrior Osborne had ever heard of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he had never truly grasped just how strong he was. As his own strength had grown, so had his arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had convinced himself that once he reached the rank of Celestial Deity or even Deity Overlord, he could stand toe-to-toe with Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the bitter truth struck Osborne like a lightning bolt&mdash;he had been woefully optimistic, completely underestimating Lord Malevolence's might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The being who had nearly </span><span>by oneself</span><span> annihilated the Human Community during the Age of Gods was beyond anything Osborne could imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the weight of Lord Malevolence's gaze, Osborne shivered, his expression grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, trying to reassure himself, "Fortunately, this is just a fragment of Lord Malevolence's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it were the real deal, I'd have to run as far away as I could, and even then, escape might not be possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But for now, I don't need to panic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced himself to remain calm, observing the unfolding situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shadow said coldly, "I am Lord Malevolence. I don't care who you are. Cease your actions immediately and do not harm my descendants! If you do, I will not let you off lightly. The warriors under my command, countless in number, will hunt you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure's words were chilling, but Osborne noticed something off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it claimed to be Lord Malevolence, its mannerisms were stiff and robotic, lacking the true essence of the being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization allowed him to breathe a little easier. If it had been anyone else, even knowing it wasn't the real Lord Malevolence, they would likely be gripped by fear, worried about retaliation, and would choose to withdraw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But not Osborne. He let out a mocking laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think that's enough to make me back off? Dream on! Lord Malevolence, you're the greatest enemy of the Human Community in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. I may not be able to take you on directly right now, but I can certainly deal with your descendants. What are you going to do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed coldly, but he remained hidden in the parallel dimension, refusing to show himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this was merely a shard of Lord Malevolence's power, who knew what it was capable of? A split second could mean his end, and then where would he turn for </span><span>explanations?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity hadn't fully recovered yet; it could only heal his injuries but couldn't grant him true immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne were to die, it would be the real deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he wouldn't back down from the transformation he was performing on Tobey's body, nor would he leave this safe haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am Lord Malevolence. I don't care who you are. Cease your actions immediately, and do not harm my descendants! If you do, I will not let you off lightly. The warriors under my command, countless in number, will hunt you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shadow echoed this threat once more, and Osborne couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like this shadow really doesn't have Lord Malevolence's consciousness! It's just following a programmed response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think that's enough to scare me off? Dream on!" he muttered to himself, patiently awaiting the completion of Tobey's transformation into a member of the Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, without warning, the shadow shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It appears you didn't heed my warning! Good. It's been a long time since anyone dared defy me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will remember you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You who would harm my descendants, get ready to be hunted down by the warriors of the hundred tribes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter who you are, you will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a rigid determination, the shadow lunged into Tobey's body, and in an instant, Tobey's physique began to swell uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's voice rang out, cold and unyielding. "No one can enslave my descendants!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the next moment came with a deafening crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey's body erupted in a violent explosion, scattering energy and remnants in all directions.</span></p><div class="pagination">
