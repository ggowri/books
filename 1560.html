  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A flash of determination crossed Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guy, you'd better think twice before you come after me. If you do, I won't hesitate to turn you into one of my Blood Clan descendants!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought in mind, he turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Wild Flame Army boasted a true strength of 500 thousand, but only about 300 thousand were currently stationed around Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of those, 100 thousand had been dispatched to the West Zone to support the battlefield, while another 100 thousand had gone to Divine Peak Nine, where they had recently suffered a heavy defeat, losing over 40 thousand troops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite these losses, the number of recruits eager to join the Wild Flame Army was high, and within days, they had filled the ranks again. As a newly appointed centurion, Osborne would likely find that most of his future members, apart from a few squad leaders, would be fresh recruits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the arrangement of his new team would depend on his direct superior, Bruno Borden, who was also from the Fero Tiger Clan and the Borden family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno was a late-stage Celestial Deity and currently held the rank of chiliarch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to Wild Flame Army regulations, every leader of ten thousand had their own designated training ground for their subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne made his way to Guy's base, which was located in the southern part of Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He arrived quickly, and after showing his centurion badge, he was allowed to enter the compound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The base was expansive, capable of accommodating thousands of soldiers for training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, several thousand recruits were practicing in the main training area. Most of them were newly joined soldiers, primarily at the Superior Deity level, with a few at the Transcendent Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne ignored them and headed straight for Guy's office to report in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon his arrival, he found the office buzzing with activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A divine power enveloped the entire space, preventing any prying eyes from getting a glimpse inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a spark of curiosity and discreetly activated his Satan's Eye, using spatial energy to create an incredibly small dimensional portal between the office and the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This minuscule portal emitted such weak energy fluctuations that it would go unnoticed by anyone without a keen sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Osborne would have found this impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, after spending considerable time using spatial energy to gather Essence Crystals, his control over space had improved significantly, allowing him to manage this feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the tiny dimensional portal established, Osborne could not only see what was happening in the office through his Satan's Eye but also eavesdrop on the conversation taking place within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the office, he saw two men sitting and sipping coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One was a middle-aged man radiating an air of authority&mdash;Osborne recognized him as Guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He bore a striking resemblance to Laird, the general of the City Guard, about sixty percent alike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The younger man seated across from Guy was Bruno Borden, a chiliarch and Guy's nephew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy spoke casually, "Bruno, has that Lachlan&mdash;no, he should be called Osborne now&mdash;reported for duty yet? Has he been assigned to my command?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno smiled, "I just got word that Osborne has reported in! I rushed over to tell you because of it. Thanks to your advance notice, he's been smoothly placed under your command, and I'll be directly overseeing him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy nodded in satisfaction. "Excellent! Now that he's under my command, I'll have plenty of chances to deal with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rumor has it he's acquired an ancient god's treasure vault, filled with endless Essence Crystals! We need to find a way to get everything from that ancient vault out of him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno's eyes lit up with excitement at Guy's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uncle Guy, leave this to me! Since he's under my direct command, I can handle him easily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy shook his head resolutely. "No, Bruno. This Osborne is no ordinary opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He may have just broken through to the Celestial Deity realm, but he managed to hold his own against Fabian for twenty minutes without letting Fabian land a single hit! Even if you're a late-stage Celestial Deity and have the upper hand in strength, if he wants to escape, there's little you can do to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we fail and he gets wind of our intentions, it will become a real problem. We need to take him down in one go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, a flicker of ruthlessness flashed in Guy's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's why I've decided to handle this myself. Later, you need to find a chance to send him out on a task in the wilderness. I'll lie in wait here. Given my strength, he might be fast, but he won't stand a chance of getting away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them continued to discuss their plan, completely oblivious to the fact that Osborne was listening in on every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold smile crept onto Osborne's face as he processed what he had overheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "Oh, Guy! I wasn't planning to deal with you this quickly. After all, you're a Deity Overlord, and I wasn't entirely sure I could take you down without rousing suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if you're looking for trouble and planning to ambush me out in the wild, then don't say I didn't warn you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
