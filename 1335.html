  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie's voice rang out with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, we're no longer friends&mdash;we're enemies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All members of the Prophet Alliance, listen up: fight to the death! One kill pays the debt; two kills make a profit! Understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chorus of warriors from the Prophet Alliance echoed his sentiment, their eyes blazing with murderous intent as they glared at the members of Lord League, their expressions dripping with disdain and contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being outnumbered, the fierce determination of these twenty warriors somehow overshadowed the sixty-odd members of Lord League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shame crept onto the faces of the Lord League fighters. Though Eliot, Nelson, and the others spoke with righteous fervor, claiming their submission to Lord Malevolence was for the greater good of humanity, deep down, they knew the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had betrayed their own kind, and that was a bitter pill to swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how they rationalized their actions, the weight of their shame bore down on them. Under the scornful gazes of the Prophet Alliance, each felt their cheeks flush, embarrassed to face anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, that shame morphed into anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought to themselves, "We're only trying to survive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why do these Prophet Alliance fools look down on us as if we've committed some unforgivable sin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What gives them the right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliot felt that anger surge within him as well. His face flushed, then hardened with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! Eddie, if you can't understand my actions, then we shall be enemies from this day forward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's settle this once and for all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your rebellion against Lord Malevolence is leading all of humanity to the brink of destruction. If that's the case, it's better for you to be dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord League, follow my command!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the remaining members of Lord League sprang into action, launching a full-scale assault against the Prophet Alliance's twenty warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that to secure their place among the Dark Deity Legion, they had to </span><span>eliminate these rebels completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, wiping out the Prophet Alliance would silence any mockery of their perceived weakness and betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of Lord League unleashed their fury without holding back, while the Prophet Alliance warriors, fully aware of their grim fate, fought with everything they had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were determined to take a piece of Lord League with them, even if it meant death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash erupted with a thunderous </span><span>roar,</span><span> the air thick with the violence of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger stood with his arms crossed, a cold smile appearing on his face as he observed the chaos, as if watching a circus of clowns or a troupe of monkeys performing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humans tearing each other apart&mdash;how amusing," he murmured, his eyes glinting with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, hidden in a parallel dimension, Osborne watched the scene unfold with clarity. He witnessed Lord League's betrayal of humanity, their submission to the Dark Deity, and the Prophet Alliance's refusal to yield, drawing a clear line between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a stark contrast between them..." Osborne whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood Eliot's choice; to save Lord League from annihilation, submission was a decision many would make.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, not everyone could face death head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of mortality, choosing to sacrifice dignity for survival wasn't a grave sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But understanding didn't equate to acceptance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Lord League had aligned itself with Pantheon League and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization by submitting to Lord Malevolence, they had become his enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had just landed themselves on Osborne's kill list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he watched over sixty members of Lord League savagely attacking less than twenty of the Prophet Alliance, Osborne's eyes blazed with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "It's my turn to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Prophet Alliance stands for humanity, even to the point of death, refusing to submit. They've earned my respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be a travesty for them to die here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They deserve to live, to witness humanity overthrow Lord Malevolence, to see our reclaimed homeland."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared instantly on the battlefield, right behind Lord League's leader, Eliot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliot, a Transcendent Deity at the peak of his power, was no slouch compared to Terrence of the Deschanel Clan. But against Osborne in his current state, Eliot's strength was nothing to boast about&mdash;especially since Osborne had the element of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual punch, Osborne shattered Eliot's divine power defenses and impaled his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliot's chest was now a gaping wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Eliot realize what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face contorted in shock and disbelief as he turned to see Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's laughter was cold, icy. He seized Eliot by the throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Traitors to humanity deserve no mercy," he hissed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
