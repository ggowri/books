  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Joanna rejected him, Osborne didn't dwell on it. With no opportunity at the Sylvan Elf Clan Royal Family, he decided to try his luck with other Royal Families instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sylvan Elf Clan was one of the strongest, second only to the Shadow Elf Clan, but their requirements were simply too high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To even apply, a candidate needed to be an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, merely an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, was two whole levels away from the mark. He understood Joanna's refusal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her warning about the dangers in Umbra Earth and her advice to leave Elf City had actually shown some kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, feeling a flicker of hope, "I'll head to the Storm Elf Clan Royal Family and perhaps the Ocean Elf Clan as well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They only require Ascension Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm not far off from that, so maybe they'll give me a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne made his way to the assessment area of the Storm Elf Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the Sylvan Elf Clan's assessment zone, this place was buzzing with activity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lower requirements meant that Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings could sign up here, but that didn't guarantee selection after the assessments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just recently, an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King had received a Class B score in the Astral Testing Arch and hadn't managed to secure a spot on any exploration team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it stood, not a single Ascension Two Supernal Deity King had joined an exploration party yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the forefront of the Storm Elf Clan Royal Family, three princes and three princesses were seated on a raised platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most formidable among them was Princess Abigail Melano, who was Ascension Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lowest-ranked of the princes and princesses still boasted a cultivation level of Ascension Two&mdash;Princess Peggy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Storm Elf Clan Royal Family was quite powerful&mdash;comparable to the Fire Elf Clan and perhaps even slightly stronger&mdash;their entry requirements were more lenient at Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was mainly due to Princess Peggy's level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had set his sights on Peggy, hoping she would grant him a chance to take the assessment despite his low cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident that if he could participate, he could demonstrate his potential, talent, and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia had scored a total rating of Class S, and Osborne figured he had a solid shot at that too&mdash;or even higher!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never lacked self-confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on the way Letitia had been sought after, he believed that if he could achieve a Class S rating in the Astral Testing Arch, even with his Ascension One Supernal Deity King status, some princes and princesses would still be inclined to offer him a spot on their exploration teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne directed a mental plea toward Princess Peggy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Peggy, I'm Osborne Augustine from the Human Community. My cultivation level is Ascension One Supernal Deity King, and I hope you can give me a chance to qualify for a special assessment. I'm confident I can score Class S..." he said swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could finish, a scathing voice echoed in his mind&mdash;cold, arrogant, and dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Princess Peggy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, she locked her sight on him, her face twisted in contempt and ridicule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside her, a nearby man noticed her abrupt change in demeanor and frowned. "Peggy, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peggy gestured dismissively toward Osborne's direction, her tone laced with annoyance. "Just some garbage from the Human Community with only Ascension One strength. He dared to send me a message, asking for a chance to take the special assessment! Can you believe it? He even claims he can score Class S in the Astral Testing Arch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laughter rang out, bright and mocking. "That's rich! What a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peggy's words were directed at the prince beside her, but she spoke with such casual disdain that she did not bother to lower her voice or shield her words with divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other Supernal Deity Kings present could hear her loud and clear, and an immediate stir began to ripple through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Peggy, then followed her gaze to see who the audacious soul was that dared to send a private message to her, asking for a favor to bypass the rigorous assessment requirements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who does he think he is, claiming he can earn a Class S score? The sheer audacity is mind-boggling!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When their eyes landed on Osborne, the crowd erupted with scornful laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That he was only an Ascension One Supernal Deity King really hammered home the joke of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Look at this!" Hector Melano, a prince with Ascension Four cultivation level, couldn't contain himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he clued in on the situation, he burst into laughter. "This is rich! A human with Ascension One strength believes he deserves to even entertain notions about scoring Class S? He must not know how ridiculously hard it is to earn that ranking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Among all the princes and princesses from the elite Elf Royal Families, hardly more than ten have reached Class S! And he&mdash;a mere Ascension One&mdash;has the gall to think he can achieve that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector turned his derisive gaze toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, human! Get lost! The Storm Elf Clan Royal Family doesn't need arrogant pests like you crawling around! With that level of cultivation, you wouldn't even qualify to be cannon fodder for our team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scram, before I lose my patience!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted around him, echoing through the Combat Arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face went pale, his fists clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated the scene would unfold like this. He expected Peggy to reject his request or even ignore him, but the public ridicule and humiliation were far from what he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered to himself, seething with resentment, "Princess Peggy! Prince Hector!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll remember this! You better not cross paths with me outside Elf City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll show you who the real pests and wastes are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had always considered himself a decent person&mdash;not someone who would simply swallow his pride and endure humiliation without response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When others insulted him, he felt an undeniable urge to retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, being in Elf City, on the territory of the Elf Royal Family, forced him to keep his rage in check. Even though he seethed inside, Osborne knew this was not the place to act out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With anger burning in his chest, he turned to leave, but the laughter rang in his ears, each taunt a fresh wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at that! The loser's leaving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Ascension One Supernal Deity King thinks he's cut out for this? Doesn't he see the minimum requirement is Ascension Two? Not a single Ascension Two has even made the cut yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you imagine? He wants to strut into Umbra Earth like he's a player?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not even good enough to be cannon fodder! The princes and princesses aren't foolish; why would they recruit him? They'd have to babysit him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wouldn't want that fool dragging us down! He could ruin the whole mission for everyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More laughter blended with ridicule as Osborne's resolve shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He left the Combat Arena, his expression gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the Ocean Elf Clan had the same Ascension Two requirement, he had no intention of trying again. Deep down, he knew the results would be just as humiliating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation level was far too low, and no one would give him a second glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying would only lead to more contempt and mockery, and he wasn't about to subject himself to that again.</span></p><div class="pagination">
