  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, I can't promise you that." Osborne refused without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a man who valued commitments, but now he didn't even know who had killed Allen. So, he couldn't agree with Yulissa's condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if the person who killed Allen happened to be someone he couldn't handle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or what if Godfather killed Allen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne agreed to Yulissa, wouldn't he have to kill Godfather?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, it was just a hypothetical scenario.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne believed that Godfather was not the one who killed Allen. However, regardless of the circumstances, he couldn't easily agree to Yulissa's request to avenge Allen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to agree but couldn't fulfill the promise, Osborne himself wouldn't be able to accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa became anxious when she saw Osborne's resolute refusal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? Your current identity is my father's son and my brother. Don't you want to avenge him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "I sympathize with your situation, but I really can't agree to your request. However, I can help you investigate who killed your father. I will make a decision after the investigation is complete."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa was silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a long time, she bit her lip and agreed, "Alright! I agree, but you must never deceive me. You must do your best to investigate who killed my father. As long as you can do that, I promise to play the role of a sister perfectly and never expose your true identity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was not afraid of exposing his identity, it would still be troublesome if it happened. After all, his fifth inheritance test was closely related to the Augustine family, and having the identity of the heir would have made his actions much more effortless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, it would waste a lot of time and incur higher costs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current result was the best under the circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "Then, why don't you call my name like a sister first? I don't know why, but even though I don't have any real younger sisters, including you, I seem to have acquired three fake sisters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Zoe were both picked up by Osborne and were not his biological sisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa was even more peculiar, as she was forcibly bound to him by Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa's face turned slightly red. She bit her lip and called out in a low voice, "Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Louder please," Osborne said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa glared at him immediately. "Don't go too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious. "Didn't you say you would play the role of my sister convincingly? Even calling my name seems so forced. What if someone notices? It will be easy for others to see through your act."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa became anxious. "But everyone knows that we have just recently recognized each other. If I act too familiar, wouldn't it be even more suspicious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have a point!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne touched his chin and said, "Up to you, then. I'm a little sleepy, so I'll go back </span><span>to my room to rest. We'll talk about the investigation tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa lifted her hand but ultimately didn't stop Osborne. She whispered, "Alright, goodbye, Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved casually and returned to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he wasn't really tired and in need of rest. With his current physical condition, he hadn't felt fatigue for a long time. He just wanted to avoid all the Augustine family members and do something of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, he wanted to find out where Clarissa was at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being taken away by Dylan, she was quickly sent to Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Radcliffe family was of an ancient lineage and had their assets in Dampston. Osborne came to Dampston not only to complete the fifth inheritance test but also to find Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to confirm Clarissa's situation first and make sure she was not in danger before he could do things with peace of mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some consideration, Osborne called Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barlyn, where are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's voice sounded excited on the other end of the line. "Osborne, I'm in Dampston! It took me a lot of effort to convince my family to allow me to accompany Clarissa to Dampston. We're currently in Pinchide City of Dampston, inside a luxurious mansion to the north."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Barlyn by Clarissa's side, he felt more at ease. If anything were to happen, he knew that Barlyn would notify him immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Clarissa now?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn fell silent for a moment before continuing, "Ever since she was separated from you, Clarissa has refused to eat or drink. She protested to the family, but they are determined to marry her off to Alexander of the Paltrow family. She has become much thinner and weaker, and even my persuasion is useless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a pang of heartache when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "Please pass on a message to Clarissa for me. Let her know that I have arrived in Dampston, and I'm in Pinchide City! Tell her to eat properly and wait patiently, as I will come to pick her up soon. If she becomes any thinner, I will be very angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn quickly said, "Okay, Osborne, I promise to deliver your message! Only the words come from you that Clarissa is willing to listen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But are you really in Dampston now? Where are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Yes, I'm in Dampston. As for where I am, you should know soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting with Barlyn for a few more words, Osborne hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to think about how to navigate the situation within the Augustine family and complete the inheritance test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This test is divided into three stages. The first stage requires me to find the traitor </span><span>within the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could be the traitor?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
