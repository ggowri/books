  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy iron chest crashed to the ground, creating a deep dent in the solid floor and causing the entire villa to tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This incident alone indicated the immense weight of the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all taken aback, wondering what could possibly be inside that was so heavy. They knew that the Lark family, being an ancient lineage, would present something incredibly precious as a betrothal gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, regardless of its contents, they couldn't accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna glanced at Clarissa, whose icy demeanor resembled eternal frost and sighed before speaking, "Orion, we appreciate your interest in Clarissa. However, she has just lost her fianc&eacute; and is grieving. She is not ready to entertain new marriage proposals at the moment. Please leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion, upon hearing this, simply smiled, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, you might deceive others with such words, but trying to deceive me is a bit insulting. Apollo is dead, and Ms. Radcliffe must be overjoyed, right? How could someone like Apollo, a waste of space, ever be worthy of Ms. Radcliffe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps, let's have a look at my betrothal gift first, and then you can decide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Orion gestured to his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you waiting for? Bring the chest over to Ms. Radcliffe for her inspection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men immediately moved to lift the chest, their faces turning red with effort as they struggled to carry it a few steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion waved them off, saying, "Enough of this incompetence, I'll do it myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Approaching the iron chest, Orion effortlessly lifted it with a gentle smile, carrying it over to Clarissa with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "What incredible strength! This iron chest must weigh at least 10 thousand pounds, yet he lifted it so easily. Even a typical Class B martial artist couldn't move it alone. Such terrifying power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's expression turned grave as she understood that Orion was showcasing his strength, perhaps even issuing a veiled threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face remained cold and stern. She was well aware that Orion was flexing his muscles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the iron chest was placed before her, Clarissa coldly stated, "I have no interest in whatever is inside. Please take it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Escort him out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that command, Clarissa turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Observing her departure, Orion suddenly gestured, and a crack appeared in the space in front of Clarissa, resembling an abyss leading to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you planning, Orion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rein in your power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Donna swiftly positioned herself in front of Clarissa, warily eyeing Orion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion smiled, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, don't be alarmed. I mean no harm. It's just that Ms. Radcliffe hasn't even seen my betrothal gift yet and is already leaving, which saddens me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you take a look before deciding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Orion opened the iron chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold breeze emanated from within, causing the temperature in the entire villa to drop significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Clarissa couldn't help but glance at the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she saw inside left her visibly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the iron chest lay a snow-white sculpture crafted from a material resembling a diamond. The statue depicted a winged woman, her face exquisitely beautiful, with wings half pure white and half pitch black, exuding a blend of purity and allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The statue stood before them in all its breathtaking splendor, exuding a sense of ancient grandeur that spoke of countless ages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its every detail bore the mark of time's relentless passage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it was the face of the statue that truly shocked everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to Clarissa in astonishment, including those of Donna and Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The statue's face was strikingly similar to Clarissa's&mdash;almost an exact replica, though the aura it projected was subtly different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the statue had been carved in her likeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible!" Clarissa murmured, her gaze locked on the statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just the resemblance that held her spellbound; it was as if something within her was being drawn to it, something stirring to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel an unusual connection between herself and the statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist, Clarissa took a step closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion, smiling, began his introduction, "Let me tell you about this statue. Its name is The Sacred Sorceress. Its origins are shrouded in mystery, with a history stretching back at least a thousand years. My ancestors from the Lark family acquired it by chance and have kept it in the ancestral home ever since. Today, it's a level two ancient magic weapon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Sacred Sorceress? A level two ancient magic weapon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna gasped, momentarily forgetting the statue's uncanny resemblance to Clarissa. The mere fact that it was a level two ancient magic weapon made it an invaluable treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ancient magic weapons were scarce, even among ancient families, with most possessing only one&mdash;and typically just a level one weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now Orion was claiming this statue was a level two ancient magic weapon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Wise Order of the Radcliffe family learned that Orion intended to use a level two ancient magic weapon as part of his bride price for Clarissa, would they refuse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolutely not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would turn down such an offer.</span></p><div class="pagination">
