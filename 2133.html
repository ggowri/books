  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Alfreda found themselves standing before the giant entrance to the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mouth of the cave was irregularly shaped, yet the walls surrounding it were astonishingly smooth, as if something had slammed into the ground at incredible speed, carving out this abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint energy ripple emanated from deep within the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, eager to peer inside. However, his expression changed in an instant, awe and disbelief flooding his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Why can't I see anything?" Osborne's surprise was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having achieved Sacredness Level, his Satan's Eye had enhanced vision on an epic scale, capable of penetrating ten thousand yards of the Corrosive Marsh, revealing the Sacred Crystal veins below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, he found himself facing an unexpected wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cave's depths were shrouded in a dense white mist, a powerful force seemingly blocking the X-ray vision of his eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening here?" Osborne pressed his lips, concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a situation he had never encountered before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had planned to get a glimpse of what lay inside before deciding on their next move, but now he was left in uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, is something wrong?" Alfreda asked, her brow furrowed in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, a hint of frustration in his voice. "I can feel the remnants of a battle inside, but I can't see a thing! I'm worried about what kind of dangers might be lurking in there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, Alfreda didn't share his worries. Instead, she seemed almost exhilarated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Come on! We're in Umbra Earth! If we weren't facing danger, that would be weirder! Honestly, since we entered the Skeletal Wasteland, it's been eerily quiet, and that's what has me on edge. Now, with this situation, I actually feel a bit better!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The stuff in there is definitely Uriel's target! Those Umbra World beings must be trying to keep Uriel from getting whatever it is!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to get in there now! If we wait too long and they sort things out, the chance will be gone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered her words and couldn't help but agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I've been relying too much on my Satan's Eye. When it failed me, I started feeling anxious! That's not right! I should trust in my own strength! No matter what's hidden in that cave, if Uriel has the courage to go in, then I shouldn't feel afraid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolution in mind, he nodded, his determination rekindled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move! Uriel abandoned treasures in Death Chasm and the Corrosive Marsh to get here. Whatever treasures await us must be incredibly valuable! Since we've stumbled upon this opportunity, we owe it to ourselves to go for it! In Umbra Earth, these treasures are fair game for anyone who can seize them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his gaze sharpened and resolve firming up, Osborne led the way into the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they entered, the intensity of the battle's energy surges became more palpable, suggesting they weren't far from the action. Yet, despite the escalating sensations, the opaque white barrier still obscured what lay ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closer they </span><span>got,</span><span> the more shocked Osborne became as he realized that the white mass in the depths was likely some sort of protective shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a chill run down his spine. "A protective shield? What kind of shield could obscure the view of a Sacredness Level Satan's Eye? A Sacred Power shield, perhaps?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wait, could there actually be an Empyrean Sacredness warrior inside?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were the case, he wouldn't hesitate to take Alfreda and flee. No treasure was worth risking their lives, especially not against a being of such power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, an Empyrean Sacredness warrior could easily take him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how precious the treasures were, they paled in comparison to one's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, as Osborne carefully sensed the shield, he let out a relieved breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't a Sacred Power barrier after all&mdash;it was something entirely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy surrounding the cave didn't seem to possess any defensive capabilities. Even an ordinary person could easily pass through it. Yet, Osborne's Satan's Eye was inexplicably hindered by this faint energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of energy is this?" he mused, curiosity piquing his interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, he and Alfreda moved closer, stepping into the cave together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne crossed the threshold, it felt like he was slipping through a thin veil of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the world around him opened up, and his Satan's Eye regained its power, quickly revealing the scene before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he saw left him speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Towering before him was an immense palace, grand and majestic, bathed in a regal purple hue, though it bore the scars of time&mdash;crumbling walls and shattered pillars told tales of a violent past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed to have been ravaged by a force beyond comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite its dilapidated state, the palace exuded an overwhelming presence, making Osborne feel breathless, almost compelled to bow in reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In comparison, the God of Light's Sanctum of Light felt like a mere shack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's jaw dropped in disbelief as he gazed at the colossal structure, and his Satan's Eye quickly began analyzing its details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gasped, astonishment coursing through him, "A ruined Sacred Artifact-level palace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you believe it? A Sacred Artifact-level Palace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda, too, was struck by the sight of the massive purple palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Sacred Artifact?! This is truly a Sacred Artifact-level palace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, her eyes sparkled with greed, her breath quickening with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a Sacred Artifact, after all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elf City had developed for a hundred thousand years in deep space, and the number of Sacred Artifacts they possessed could be counted on one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each was a priceless treasure for the city. Throughout those ten decades, Elf City had faced countless life-and-death crises, and it was those few Sacred Artifacts that had ultimately saved them from annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda understood all too well the might of a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a typical scenario, an Empyrean Sacredness warrior could easily take down a Supernal Deity King, even one at the Ascension Ten level. The gap between them was nearly insurmountable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if a Supernal Deity King wielded a Sacred Artifact, they could stand toe-to-toe </span><span>with an Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sacred Artifacts came with their own Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And a palace-like Sacred Artifact was worth ten or even a hundred times more than a regular one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Across the cosmos, the number of Sacred Artifact-level Palaces was exceedingly rare, held only by the Apex Clans and the most powerful figures&mdash;like the leaders of the Sacred Dragon Clan, the Sacred Tiger Clan, and the Angel Clan's Cardinal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those individuals could possess a Sacred Artifact-level Palace without fear of it being snatched away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one among the entire Elf Race had ever claimed such a treasure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever an unclaimed Sacred Artifact-level palace emerged, it would spark fierce competition and brutal battles among Empyrean Sacredness warriors, leading to bloody conflicts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, here they were, deep within Umbra Earth, staring at a Sacred Artifact-level Palace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the palace appeared damaged, its true power was uncertain, and it might no longer be functional, the mere materials used to forge a Sacred Artifact-level palace were priceless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, both Osborne and Alfreda were breathless, their eyes gleaming with greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were so enthralled by the sight that they momentarily forgot about the raging battle happening around them.</span></p><div class="pagination">
