  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally relinquishing his insistence on a one-on-one duel, Sam rallied a cadre of allies to encircle Osborne, aiming to seize the Heir's Emblem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his command, the surrounding crowd sprang into action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half hailed from the branch bloodline of Marcelin, the other half from the branch bloodline of Ransford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seething with hatred for Osborne since he slew David, the branch bloodline from Ransford yearned to shred him to pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their assault was unbridled, each individual unleashing their full might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Sam hesitated to withstand the collective onslaught of nearly forty such adversaries. Watching Osborne with a sardonic grin, Sam was certain of Osborne's impending doom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All present shared this conviction: Osborne would be doomed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, at this moment, Osborne remained unflustered. With a sneer, instead of retreating, he surged forward, his speed erupting to a terrifying degree as he charged towards Sam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam was surprised and immediately sought to retreat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne would grant him no such opportunity. His long, blood-red hair grew wildly, like tendrils, to instantly entwine around Sam's massive form.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne manipulated his blood-red hair, pulling fiercely and dragging Sam to his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a calm sneer, Osborne declared, "Desire to strike me? You'd better end both Sam and me together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this sight, all attackers halted their advance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They glared at Osborne with fury. Osborne had brazenly used Sam as a shield. Persisting in their assault would undoubtedly harm Sam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam, who was already wounded by Osborne, would likely lose half his life if subjected to their combined onslaught, no matter how robust his defenses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thus, they found themselves compelled to cease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you are utterly shameless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam bellowed in rage when he was tightly ensnared by Osborne's blood-red hair. The hair even sought to burrow into his flesh and blood, forcing him into desperate resistance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the briefest of moments, he was unable to break free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered, "Am I shameless? You're unable to beat me and resort to having others besiege me. Aren't you the more shameless one? I merely defend myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam was left with no retort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His allies, fearful of injuring him, dared not attack, leading to a stalemate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this juncture, Rodney finally arrived with his entourage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon discerning the situation, Rodney felt delightfully surprised. He did not approach immediately but observed Osborne and Sam with a sarcastic smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hoped for both to suffer losses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this Branch Bloodline Competition, only three remained eligible to vie for the Heir's Emblem. If both Osborne and Sam were to falter, the ultimate victor could only be Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Naturally, Rodney was in no rush to intervene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Realizing Rodney's intentions, Sam looked even more ashen, his anger palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, at this moment, Sam found himself without a viable solution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, a solitary adversary, proved so intractable. With Rodney lurking nearby, poised to capitalize, Sam was at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The situation had reached an impasse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam could do nothing to Osborne, who was surrounded and unable to escape. Rodney was not prepared to act, leaving the three in a tense standoff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne eyed Rodney and the peculiar disc in his possession.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne could sense that it was this strange disc that emitted power, freezing the surrounding space and rendering his spatial power moot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That must be an ancient magic weapon capable of freezing space. It's too restrictive to my spatial power. I must devise a way to acquire it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once I possess it, I will undoubtedly triumph in this Branch Bloodline Competition!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne swiftly conceived a plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Rodney noticed Osborne's gaze fixed on his Forbidden Space Disk, he couldn't help but chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He asked calmly, "Osborne, do you covet this Forbidden Space Disk greatly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Is it called the Forbidden Space Disk?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Indeed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney smiled faintly, "It is a fifth-level ancient magic weapon, the Forbidden Space Disk! Its sole function is to freeze the space within a 30-mile radius, rendering it extremely stable and completely nullifying your spatial power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Unless you've mastered intermediate spatial manipulation, even with spatial power, you won't be able to disrupt the surrounding space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, do you desire it greatly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt curious and asked, "From what you've said, if I want it, would you be willing to give it to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney smiled, "Of course! This Forbidden Space Disk is of no use to me. Hand over the Heir's Emblem, and this disk will be yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne couldn't help but laugh upon hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "It turned out that Rodney aimed to obtain the emblem and sought to trade it for the Forbidden Space Disk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ridiculous!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No deal!" Osborne responded coolly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney turned gloomy. "Osborne, you'd better reconsider! You're surrounded and destined to lose the Heir's Emblem. Instead of having it snatched away, you might as well exchange it for the Forbidden Space Disk!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is in your best interest!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a playful smile, Osborne retorted, "Really? Then you give me the Forbidden Space Disk first, and when I have it, I'll give you the emblem."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney's face grew even more somber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew Osborne was toying with him. If he handed over the Forbidden Space Disk, Osborne could unfreeze the space and escape instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By then, no one would be able to catch him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney seethed, "Osborne, you're courting death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you refuse to trade, don't blame me. I'll join forces with Sam to seize your emblem first!"</p><div class="pagination">
