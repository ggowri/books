  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compared to the Pantheon League's Dimensional Microcosm, the one I built for the Augustine family looks a bit rough around the edges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, this Dimensional Microcosm will be mine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I have it, I can merge it with the Augustine family's Microcosm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne strode confidently toward the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't bother hiding his presence; there was no need. His Satan's Eye had already swept through the Dimensional Microcosm in an instant. Aside from a few lingering Superior and Transcendent Deities, everyone else here was either Intermediate Deity or Junior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the population exceeding 100 thousand, not a single soul here posed a threat to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ones who tormented my parents and drove them into that black vortex are hiding somewhere in this place. I'll drag you out into the light..." Osborne murmured as he stepped into the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps the Pantheon League never considered that someone could slip silently into their Dimensional Microcosm. As he made his way through the bustling streets, many people saw him but didn't bat an eye at his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne soon arrived at the heart of the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compared to the chaos outside, this place feels like a paradise! At least here, the residents don't have to worry about Beast Tides or being oppressed by stronger foes... Too bad that peace is about to be shattered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint flashed in Osborne's eyes as he approached an ancient building at the center of the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye had already detected that nearly all the Intermediate and Junior Deities in this Dimensional Microcosm were gathered inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This ancient structure was the very core of the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people who tormented his parents over twenty years ago, if they were still alive, </span><span>had surely ascended to godhood, and most would be Junior Deities now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was confident he would find clues about his parents here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was about to enter the building, two young men stepped in his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you're doing?! Don't you know this is Mount of Gods Manor? No matter which Divine Family you belong to, you need to get out of here. This place isn't for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two young men barked at </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> their tone aggressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, slightly taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mount of Gods Manor? </span><span>So</span><span> the Pantheon League's ancestral site, 'Mount of Gods,' isn't actually a mountain but refers to this manor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered this, the two youths closed in, roughly shoving Osborne, trying to push him aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were only Class S in strength; they couldn't budge him an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Osborne felt like an immovable mountain. No matter how hard they pushed, he didn't budge, and shock quickly spread across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who... who the hell are you?" one of them stammered, eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snapped back to </span><span>reality,</span><span> his gaze icy as he fixed it on the two young men. A spark ignited in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mere glance, their expressions froze, their bodies turning to stone, rooted in place and unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne walked past them, entering Mount of Gods Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he left, a faint ripple of energy surged around the two stone figures, followed by a sharp crack as they shattered into countless fine shards, blood spilling from the fragments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne moved through Mount of Gods Manor as if nothing had happened. With his current power, even a Transcendent Deity wouldn't be able to withstand a single blow from him. Dealing with two Class S individuals required no effort at all; a single glance was enough to end them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mount of Gods Manor was expansive and tranquil, giving the impression of living within a painting, where elegance intertwined with luxury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a casual glance around before making his way toward the back of the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep within the Dimensional Microcosm, nearly all the god-tier warriors&mdash;more than three thousand in total&mdash;were assembled in the depths of Mount of Gods Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Transcendent Deity warrior was currently sharing insights on cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne stepped into the manor, no one came to obstruct him. He breezed through the halls and soon found himself at the back of a courtyard, where he spotted a gathering of Pantheon League warriors holding a meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were more than thirty-five hundred </span><span>god</span><span>-tier warriors in attendance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, only one was a Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following him were a handful of Superior Deities, five hundred Intermediate Deities, and the rest comprised Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "The Pantheon League is still a formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can't hunt them all down and force them out of hiding, letting them linger here to continue their training will lay the groundwork for future disasters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And right now... they're all going to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought fueling his resolve, Osborne strode forward. Many in the meeting noticed him, but most dismissed him as just another Junior Deity from a Divine Family who had recently broken through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until he climbed onto a high platform, standing at the highest point, that the atmosphere shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, who is this guy? What's he doing up there?" one warrior asked, a hint of confusion coloring his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't he know the rules?" another murmured.</span></p><div class="pagination">
