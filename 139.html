  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna stared at Osborne in shock, her eyes filled with deFianc&eacute;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had simply been careless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Osborne to break through her earthen wall defense, so she had been momentarily stunned, allowing Osborne to close in and attack her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, she still had many tricks up her sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were to fight again, she would never make the same mistake. Even if Osborne could break through her Earth Wall, she was confident she could create distance once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, she didn't believe she could lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a loss was a loss. Although Donna was reluctant to accept it, she wasn't one to break her word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned and asked, "How did you do that? Your strength surged so suddenly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just smiled slightly, not explaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Barlyn chimed in with a laugh. "Mom, now you see why you shouldn't underestimate Osborne. He's not just a martial artist; he's also a mind control metahuman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A mind control metahuman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna looked at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous assassination attempts, she had always been preoccupied with Raymond, never witnessing Osborne's abilities firsthand. Although she had heard of Osborne's prowess and how he had saved Clarissa multiple times, she had no idea he was a metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, you used mind control to enhance your punches?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna hit the nail on the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't explain that it wasn't mind control but rather the ocular energy of Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply nodded and said, "Something like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna nodded in understanding. "I see! I didn't realize you were a mind control metahuman. I was careless. With your mind control abilities combined with your Class C martial artist strength, you can indeed rival Raymond."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled. "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, does this mean you agree to my proposal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only said you can rival him. I still think your proposal is too risky. Raymond and I are different. My advantage is defense, while Raymond's is offense. Facing him would be extremely dangerous for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, we don't know if Raymond has any equally powerful allies. I advise you to think it through carefully and not let impulsiveness harm you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed. "What in this world isn't dangerous? If I were afraid of danger, I would have settled down in the countryside as a wealthy recluse long ago. Why would I stay here? Why would I stay with the Radcliffe family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Osborne has already won the bet with you. You can't go back on your word! I support Osborne's decision. We must take the initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we can't capture Raymond alive, we must let The Aberrants know that we dare to draw our swords, we dare to resist! We are not their lambs to the slaughter, not the powerless ones they can attack whenever they wish!" Barlyn said excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Donna began but couldn't find the words to argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Osborne's proactive approach was right; she just didn't trust his capabilities, fearing he was merely seeking his death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that Osborne had proven he could hold his own against a Class C+ metahuman, she couldn't find a reason to object.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she nodded. "Alright, I agree! I'll use the Radcliffe family's network to search for Raymond's hiding place with everything we've got."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was eager to capture Raymond for his thunder elemental essence, but finding Raymond on his own was nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Radcliffe family was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having operated in Mayby City for centuries, their network of connections was incredibly complex. Their intelligence and informants in the city were even more formidable than Godfather's organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Radcliffe family were willing to pay the price to search, they would find Raymond no matter where he was hiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll be waiting for your good news, Ms. Donna Radcliffe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Clarissa approached, her brow furrowed. "Osborne," she said, "you don't need to take such a risk. You've saved me so many times, and now you want to risk your life again for me. I... I don't know how to repay you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lips, and her pretty face was filled with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she believed Osborne's insistence on taking the initiative and capturing Raymond alive was to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, opening and closing his mouth without knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't explain his true motive, so he could only let Clarissa misunderstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is what I should do," Osborne could only say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was even more moved. "Osborne, why are you so good to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!" Donna interrupted coldly, "Now is not the time to talk about this. Let's wait until we succeed! Since the matter is decided, let's go all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Clarissa and added, "Clarissa, I need you to personally contact the Chevalier family and ask them to send their law enforcement team to help us search Mayby City and find Raymond's hiding place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Contact the Chevalier family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face changed. She was clearly reluctant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna said indifferently, "Of course. There's no one more suitable for this task than the Chevalier family. You have an engagement with Apollo Chevalier. If you personally ask them for help, they won't refuse."</span></p><div class="pagination">
