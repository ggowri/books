  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela had to admit, she had never seen anyone as formidable as Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though his cultivation level hadn't reached Empyrean Sacredness, he could still instantly kill a group of mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in the Fairy Moon Sect, there had never been such a person. Even Adriana, at his cultivation level, absolutely couldn't achieve this level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These mid Empyrean Sacredness pirates were only of average strength; they couldn't be considered geniuses. However, their cultivation level indicated their strength couldn't be weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne essentially skipped two cultivation levels to instantly kill his opponents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His strength is terrifying!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least Angela had never seen it with her own eyes. She had only heard that in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family, some princes and princesses, even with their cultivation level below Empyrean Sacredness, could defeat mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they relied more on their Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Top-tier powers like the Glorious Divine Kingdom possess numerous Legendary Sacred Artifacts, even Supreme Sacred Artifacts, and they have special methods to allow princes and princesses who haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness to wield these Legendary Sacred Artifacts and Supreme Sacred Artifacts in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such cases, it's understandable that they can surpass two cultivation levels to defeat mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors. They can even surpass three cultivation levels to defeat advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also relied on the power of a Sacred Artifact, but his Bloodwrought Bow was merely an Inferior Sacred Artifact, not even a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to the Legendary Sacred Artifacts and Supreme Sacred Artifacts owned by the princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the strength boost the Bloodwrought Bow gives Osborne is practically negligible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he relied on his own strength to instantly kill mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha also spoke, "You truly are a monster!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the state duel, although she lost to Osborne, she actually couldn't accept it because she could clearly feel that her strength was greater than his at the time. In the battle, she was also suppressing him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only exploited her weakness, which is why he defeated her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, compared to the time of the state duel, Osborne's strength has improved tremendously. Even though Agatha has broken through to Empyrean Sacredness during this period, she knows she is no longer his equal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His strength has already far surpassed hers!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps she can only fully unleash the power of Dark Phoenix to contend with him now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha felt incredibly surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She is the Dark Phoenix, the strongest individual in the Ember Phoenix Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in the depths of the universe, there are few races that can rival a Dark Phoenix of the same cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's cultivation level is lower than Agatha's, yet he has shown greater strength than hers. So, she naturally considers him a monster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He humbly said, "What monster? They're just too weak!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t even show any apology, as he believed these Space Pirates were indeed not strong. They just had higher cultivation levels, so Angela, at the same cultivation level, could easily take them all down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even without using the power of the Dark Phoenix, Agatha could easily defeat them across levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These pirates are not geniuses; their strength is quite average.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">With my current strength, I can easily defeat ordinary mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors, but if it's a mid Empyrean Sacredness prodigy like Angela, I'm not confident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If my Earth Arrow wants to break through her defense, it&rsquo;s definitely not easy! I&rsquo;d need to shoot at least three arrows, maybe even ten!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I should also be able to handle ordinary advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By this calculation, he really is somewhat of a monster. After all, he is still an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, his strength can still improve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Marrow Crystal of the Magma Devourer is being rapidly decomposed and absorbed by Satan's Eye, and Osborne feels his body could break through to advanced Empyrean Sacredness at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Also, his Bloodwrought Bow is about to break through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He fed the massive corpse of the Magma Devourer to the Warfare Ancient Tree, prioritizing the upgrade of the Bloodwrought Bow. At this moment, the Bloodwrought Bow is just a step away from becoming a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once successful, Osborne's Solar Sacred Arrow will become even more powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! We move forward!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eliminating the Skull Pirates didn't take much time. The warship continued its journey, weaving through the dense cluster of small celestial bodies, heading toward the destination.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Osborne stood on the deck, activated his Satan's Eye, and scanned the surrounding celestial bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The appearance of the Skull Pirates served as a reminder. This was already Stellar Region M72, far more chaotic and unruly than the Racial Convergence Stellar Region. They could encounter Space Pirates' raids at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Space Pirates might be hiding behind the surrounding small celestial bodies. Once they enter the encirclement, the Space Pirates would suddenly appear and trap them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time they realize it, they won't be able to escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, they were lucky. The Skull Pirates they encountered were fairly average in strength. The strongest pirate leader was merely a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior, but they couldn't rely on being lucky all the time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If next time they encounter powerful Space Pirates with a group of advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors, or even Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors, then they'll be in big trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye has extremely strong penetration ability, allowing him to see the situation behind small celestial bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If there are Space Pirates hiding behind small celestial bodies, he can spot them in advance and avoid them before getting surrounded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, this is just the edge of Stellar Region M72, usually deserted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those large Space Pirate organizations wouldn&rsquo;t come here to plunder. So, over the next three days, everything went smoothly. They finally arrived at the resource-bearing planet recorded on the star map.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here, there is a Cosmic Translocator that leads to the deeper part of Stellar Region M72.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as the warship approached the planet, Osborne noticed in advance that there were actually people on this resource-bearing planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, at least hundreds of people were gathered in a certain area of the planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was exactly where the Cosmic Translocator was located.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned and said, "Why are there so many people? Didn't the star map show that this is an abandoned resource-bearing planet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, many of these people are warriors! There are over a dozen advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors alone!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's words surprised both Angela and Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela frowned and asked, "Over a dozen advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors? Could it be a large Space Pirates organization resting here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "Probably not! These people don't seem to be from the same faction! It looks like they're repairing the Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After taking a closer look, he frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dammit! The Cosmic Translocator on this resource-bearing planet has been sabotaged!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela and Agatha felt nervous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this Cosmic Translocator is unusable, they would have to travel far to find another one leading to the depths of Stellar Region M72.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, just crossing the starry sky would take months or even longer!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go down and take a look!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela said, "I happen to know a bit about the Cosmic Translocator. I might not be able to set it up, but I can handle basic repairs!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
