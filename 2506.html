  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This woman carried a strange aura that made Osborne feel very uneasy, but when Osborne tried to sense it carefully, he found nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That strange aura disappeared, as if everything he just felt was merely an illusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne knew it couldn't be an illusion; even Satan's Eye twitched for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Satan's Eye twitching signifies danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately became alert, but his face showed no sign of it. He calmly said, "It is indeed my first time at Blossom Cage. May I ask who you are?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mature woman smiled and said, "I am the reception manager of Blossom Cage. My name is Romina Hubbard."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked, "Ms. Hubbard, could you arrange a quieter place for me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He planned to send Romina away before using Satan's Eye to investigate the situation at Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Romina was an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior. Osborne sensed danger from her, and with her nearby, he didn't dare to activate Satan's Eye easily, fearing she might notice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Romina smiled, "Of course, no problem."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Celia, take him to Courtyard No. 9. Fulfill any requests he has."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A beautiful woman walked over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman wore only a few pieces of translucent fabric covering key areas, almost as if she were unclothed, exuding an aura of seduction. Her eyes seemed magical; with just one glance at Osborne, she stirred an uncontrollable desire within him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this charm power?" Osborne wondered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was startled, deliberately showing a hint of fascination and desire, unconsciously following behind Celia into the depths of Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Romina watched Osborne's back and let out a faint cold laugh. "Another one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, her figure disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt the gaze behind him disappear and finally breathed a sigh of relief, murmuring to himself, "Why does Blossom Cage feel so different from the legends? There's an eerie vibe everywhere. How can guests feel at ease spending money in such an environment? Or am I the only one sensing this strangeness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious. Not to mention the dangerous aura around Romina, even Celia, who was leading the way for him, seemed off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She naturally exuded a seductive power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That wasn&rsquo;t a big deal; after all, Blossom Cage was a brothel. Using such means to stir up customers' desires and encourage more spending was perfectly normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The abnormality lay in Celia's soul fluctuation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's soul power was immense, especially after the Primordial and Warfare Ancient Tree merged with his Soul Current Ocean, making his soul power far surpass opponents of the same level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the soul power of those Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors might not necessarily surpass his.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne could sense other people's soul fluctuations more clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, Osborne felt that Celia's soul fluctuation was exactly the same as the soul fluctuation of the two receptionists at the door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was rather strange because everyone's soul fluctuation is unique and different, even between biological siblings, there would be significant differences.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after Osborne entered Blossom Cage, he encountered a total of four women. Except for Romina, whose soul fluctuation he couldn't sense, he found that the soul fluctuations of the other three women were exactly the same, as if they were originally the same person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Something's definitely wrong!" Osborne became even more alert.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he kept a calm expression. He had no intention of uncovering Blossom Cage's secrets. He came to Blossom Cage solely to investigate Layne's situation, only wanting to learn from Layne the location of the Frenetic Storm Warband and the condition of his parents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't care what was wrong with Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as Blossom Cage didn't cause him trouble, he could pretend to know nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celia led Osborne to a lavishly decorated courtyard, looked at him, and said, "We're here. This is Courtyard No. 9. There's a protective shield outside Courtyard No. 9 that can detect any spying and withstand full-force attacks from Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors. Here, you can enjoy yourself without worry; no one will disturb you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If anyone does, Blossom Cage will handle it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's your first time at Blossom Cage, so you probably don't know any women here, right? How about I recommend the two most beautiful and skilled girls to accompany you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished speaking, Osborne immediately felt desire rise in his heart again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly suppressed the unsettling desire and replied, "Not for now. I'm not in a good state right now. I'll need to recover a bit before I can enjoy myself. You can leave for now. I'll call you when I need you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celia was stunned for a moment, then smiled and nodded. "Alright. If you need anything, feel free to call me, I'll be right outside the door. Also, over there are the profiles of the girls at Blossom Cage and the services they offer. If you fancy anyone, just let me know anytime."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Celia walked out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the small courtyard, only Osborne was left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief and immediately activated Satan's Eye to check the situation in the small courtyard. After confirming there was nothing monitoring him, he finally relaxed completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Blossom Cage is strange. I can't stay here too long. I should finish things quickly and leave as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he fully activated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside each small courtyard, there was a layer of a protective shield. Celia said this shield could withstand the full-force attacks and any prying from Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt this was a bit exaggerated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, if his Satan's Eye was fully activated, it could easily penetrate this protective shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I should find Layne first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne never forgot that he wasn't here for fun but to find Layne. At this moment, with Satan's Eye activated, the protective shield in front of him instantly became transparent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw Celia guarding outside the door and sensed the strange soul fluctuation on her. Osborne's gaze extended into the distance and quickly caught sight of the situation in another nearby courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the courtyard, a burly man was having sex with three women, and the intense scene made Osborne feel disgusted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After confirming that the man was not Layne, he immediately shifted his gaze to the next courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation in the courtyard was almost the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beautiful women were pleasing the men, letting them indulge their desires.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Osborne couldn't hear the sounds, he knew it was intense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pushed Satan's Eye to its limit, exploring one courtyard after another, and finally saw his target Layne in a courtyard at the deepest part of Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne narrowed his eyes coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Layne is the deputy leader of the Frenetic Storm Warband. Since Osborne had found him, finding the Frenetic Storm Warband wouldn't be difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne frowned tightly, sensing that something was off with Layne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
