  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The draw continued.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the ten group winners, the ones considered the weakest, Clara and Leroy, had already drawn their lots. The only ones left were the eight princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne's next opponent would inevitably be a prince or princess.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze swept over the eight princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, he looked at Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He really hoped his next opponent would be Seraphina, the top ranker in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her strength was the greatest. If she were eliminated without even making it to the top ten, it would bring even more disgrace to the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Seraphina is Hendrix's younger sister!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is one of Osborne's main enemies to avenge. Over a thousand years ago, Hendrix, relying on his age and strength, humiliated and bullied him several times, even breaking his leg once.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he even threatened Osborne, forbidding treatment. Otherwise, he would break Osborne's leg again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of this, Osborne lay in bed for half a month before his broken leg finally healed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was filled with hatred toward Hendrix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had long decided that he would break one of Seraphina's legs right in front of Hendrix!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although his actions might anger Hendrix or even the Royal Family, on the arena, attacks are unpredictable. He believed the Royal Family wouldn't do anything to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, they would become a laughingstock to the whole world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne was eagerly hoping that Seraphina would draw him as her opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, his hopes were ultimately dashed, as it was soon confirmed that his opponent would be Yunus, the fifth rank in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yunus had previously mocked and targeted Clara on the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a bit disappointed because his opponent wasn't Seraphina!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it. Even if it's not Seraphina, it doesn't matter! Anyway, we'll face each other sooner or later, unless she loses early and doesn't even make it to the top five."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yunus is a good choice too! He just targeted and mocked Clara, so I'll deal with him first! He'll be the second Royal Family member to be defeated!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And this is just the beginning!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family manipulated the draw, arranging for Yvonne, who had lost once, to face the "weakest" Leroy, hoping Yvonne would make it into the top ten to restore their dignity and honor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What they don't know is that their real humiliation is yet to come!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All nine princes and princesses participating in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel will be defeated!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not a single one of them will escape!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne no longer paid attention to the other draws. After all, barring any surprises, the princes and princesses would advance no matter what.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Yunus and Yvonne, who drew Osborne and Leroy, will be the victims of this round!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Mason will be too!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought his opponent was Clara, so he had a chance to make it into the top ten, thinking she was at least easier to deal with than the other princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could only cast a sympathetic glance at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drawing is over!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro announced, "Now, the top 20 matches begin! The first match, group leader Clara versus group runner-up Mason!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The winner will advance to the top ten!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The loser will be eliminated!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, all the other first-place winners left the stage&mdash;except for Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Mason eagerly stepped onto the ring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He excitedly looked at Clara, filled with fierce fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He coldly said, "Apart from the princes and princesses, only one person can enter the top ten! That person will definitely be me, because I am the tenth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara sneered, "Oh really? Being the tenth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings makes you so impressive? If I recall, the last person I defeated was the ninth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. Also, I&rsquo;m the last in the rankings, but I think three moves are enough to beat you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason's expression instantly froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He angrily said, "You're so arrogant! You only defeated Princess Yvonne because you hid your strength, and she wasn't well-prepared, just careless! Otherwise, how could you possibly be her match?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And now, I'm prepared, so I won't be careless or reckless again, and I won't give you any chance! Even if your strength isn't weak, the one who will win in the end will still be me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara asked, "Oh really? Then when you were defeated by Princess Seraphina in one move, were you also careless and reckless? How ridiculous! Let's fight directly! Let me see your strength!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, she took out an iron chain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this was not the Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain, but just a quasi-Sacred Artifact Chain!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the crowd burst into exclamations. Everyone looked at Clara in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She actually used a quasi-Sacred Artifact, not even a Sacred Artifact, to fight her opponent on the stage of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel's top 20 competition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For warriors at their level, using a quasi-Sacred Artifact was almost no different from fighting barehanded!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, it might be worse than having no weapon, because the quasi-Sacred Artifact couldn't fully unleash Clara's strength and was completely a burden to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the crowd erupted in commotion and exclamations, all shocked by Clara's actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did she grab the wrong one?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She should have two chains, one is a quasi-Sacred Artifact, and the other is a Legendary Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She must have grabbed the wrong one!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Mason's face darkened as well. He said, "I'll give you time to switch weapons!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, however, smiled and said, "I didn't grab the wrong one! I think, to deal with you, I don't even need a Legendary Sacred Artifact! Using a quasi-Sacred Artifact against you is more than enough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're not worthy of me using a Legendary Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes revealed disdain, and she felt delighted. Previously, in the Empire Hotel, Mason had mocked and targeted Osborne, even saying he would harshly teach Osborne a lesson in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara had long been annoyed with Mason.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that she had the chance to fight him, she naturally wanted to humiliate him as much as possible to vent for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, the prerequisite for humiliating Mason was Clara's strength being strong enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, if she ended up defeated or forced to give up using the quasi-Sacred Artifact, the one embarrassed would be herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Mason's eyes were bloodshot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could feel that Clara was deliberately humiliating him. This filled him with terrifying rage and intense killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clara, you're asking for death!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I originally thought you would be a decent opponent, but now it seems you're nothing but a lunatic! Using a quasi-Sacred Artifact against me? Do you even deserve it?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Mason launched his attack. At this moment, he was completely enraged and insane.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He joined the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel to make a name for himself, to spread his name across the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unexpectedly, Mason's first opponent was Seraphina, the top ranker in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said he wasn't worthy of her using Sacred Artifacts, then defeated him with a single bare-handed move, leaving him utterly humiliated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the second battle, he thought he could win.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, his opponent, Clara, was equally arrogant. She said he wasn't worthy of her using the Legendary Sacred Artifact and only deserved to face the quasi-Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ridiculous!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Mason was furious. He wielded the Legendary Sacred Artifact, unleashed all his power, and launched a frenzied attack on Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
