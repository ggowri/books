  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly explained the situation to Alfreda, then formally and seriously introduced Alfreda to everyone present.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda was already stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't because she had been resurrected by Osborne after her death, nor because Osborne had six women. It was because everyone present gave her an incredibly powerful feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although everyone had tried their best to suppress their aura, they still gave Alfreda an overwhelming sense of pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Alfreda's cultivation level was only at Ascension Four Supernal Deity King Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt that everyone present was stronger than the Empyrean Sacredness warriors in Elf City. Even Isidore, the strongest in Elf City, was nothing compared to these people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Isidore was an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda was a bit scared at this moment, holding onto Osborne's arm tightly, not daring to let go. She cautiously observed everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Isa smiled and said, "Alfreda, you've just been revived. You must have a lot to talk about with Osborne, right? Take your time. We'll go handle some matters."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Isa led everyone away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was somewhat reluctant to leave, cautiously watching Osborne and Alfreda. But in the end, she was also pulled away by Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isa, why are you pulling me? I need to keep an eye on Osborne and stop him from flirting with other women again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana whispered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa sneered, "We said the same thing to Osborne before. Back then, he didn't even know you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Precisely because of someone like me, we need to keep a closer eye on him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can you handle it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why can't I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if you can handle it, you can't keep an eye on Alfreda! Alfreda is someone who once died for Osborne! She's way more important to Osborne than you are! Are you sure you want to watch her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Alfreda joins us, does that mean I'm sixth and she's seventh?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The conversation between Isa and Adriana reached Osborne and Alfreda's ears. Osborne felt extremely awkward, while Alfreda blushed shyly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't help but give Osborne a fierce glare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How did I not see that you're actually a playboy? Six women? Can you handle that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Alfreda finished speaking, she pinched Osborne's arm hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit awkward but didn&rsquo;t explain anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just looked at Alfreda seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Alfreda had put on a luxurious green dress, wrapping her petite yet curvy figure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glared fiercely at Osborne, locking eyes with him. At first, her gaze was sharp, as if questioning him, but it gradually softened, and her pretty face turned slightly red. She slowly lowered her head, no longer daring to meet Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking about how she had just stood naked in front of Osborne, she felt very embarrassed. She had even tried to strip Osborne in front of so many people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda wished she could find a hole to crawl into.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was even more shocked by the fact that she was still alive!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her memory stayed on the moment she fearlessly stood in front of Osborne, self-destructing her body to give him a chance to survive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she fell into darkness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought she was dead, but the darkness vanished. When she opened her eyes again, she saw Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is alive!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She is alive too!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Alfreda laughed joyfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bravely lifting her head, she looked into Osborne's eyes and murmured, "Osborne, it's so good to be alive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's so good to see you again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was shocked and nodded firmly. "Yes! It's so good to see you again! From now on, don't ever do something so foolish again! No matter what happens, I don't need you to die for me! No matter how dangerous the situation, I'll be the one to protect you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda was stunned too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes revealed a complex expression, but she shook her head firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! If it happens again, I would still do the same!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, Alfreda stood on tiptoe and hugged Osborne's neck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said with utmost seriousness, "Because in that moment before death, I was already certain that I had fallen in love with you! No matter if it happens again, or a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times, as long as you're in danger, I will stand in front of you without hesitation, even if it means dying, it doesn't matter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Alfreda took a deep breath. "Kiss me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne froze. Looking at Alfreda's adorable face and utterly serious expression, her words echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, without any hesitation, Osborne lowered his head and kissed Alfreda's red lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's body froze, but soon softened. She held Osborne's neck tightly, passionately responding to his kiss. Their breathing grew heavier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure enough, another one!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a sound seemed to come through. Alfreda's body instantly tensed, and she immediately tried to push Osborne away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne held her tightly, not letting her go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ignore them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne waved his hand, and a force instantly spread out, forming a ball of light that completely enveloped their bodies, also blocking Adriana's gaze from afar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana, who was watching from afar, immediately felt a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa stood beside her, arms crossed, looking at her somewhat helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, can you focus on something serious?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana gave an awkward laugh. "Stop calling me Ms. Alba! From now on, you're the boss. I'm sixth, and that girl inside is seventh! Watching my own man to keep him in line&mdash;isn't that serious business? If I don't keep an eye on him, what if other women show up later?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whatever!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa said calmly, "I'm going to train! Stop sneaking peeks and go train too! When Emperor Frederick comes, you're the only one who can stop him! If you can't, we're all dead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's there to fear? Osborne can revive me, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa froze for a moment, then said, "Osborne does have the ability to revive us, but that's not invincible! So, our own strength is what truly matters."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I got it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana muttered, "I've been your teacher for so long, yet now you're the one lecturing me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, she still followed Isa and couldn't help but keep looking back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She murmured, "Can Alfreda handle it? Her cultivation level is only at Ascension Four Supernal Deity King Level. Her body is so fragile. I'm afraid she can't endure the intense lovemaking with Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isa, could Alfreda get sick from having sex with Osborne?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isa, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa finally couldn't hold back and forcibly dragged Adriana away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And within the light sphere, everything happened naturally.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her cultivation level is Ascension Four Supernal Deity King Level, so Alfreda couldn't handle the intense lovemaking with Osborne. Even though he was already very gentle, she quickly begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She lay in Osborne's arms, eyes closed, feeling his breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, how long have I been dead?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Almost two years!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda opened her eyes, biting her lip. "Two years? I don't even know how my parents are doing. I don't know how Elf City is either!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, I want to go back to Elf City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne paused. After hesitating for a moment, he explained the situation in Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Alfreda jumped up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Isidore went after my parents? He imprisoned them? Forced them to help him merge with the Elven Mother Tree? How dare he?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, I must go back immediately!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
