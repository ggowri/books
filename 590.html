Although he lived in the Augustine Estate, his residence, Mount Celestial Reach, had been designated as a forbidden area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the elders were not allowed to enter there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the family members had few </span><span>chance</span><span>s to meet Godfather. </span><span>They learned about him mostly</span><span> from legends and the fact that he was the reason the Augustine family became the top ancient family in Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his 80th birthday party was about to begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was finally about to show up amid everyone's expectant eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Vincent, Matthew, Owen, Emma, and Lance all rose to their feet obediently and stared at the door with great anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the</span><span> door didn&rsquo;t budge at all</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When everyone was confused, a faint, elderly voice suddenly sounded from behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Make yourself at home</span><span>. Sit down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, </span><span>they </span><span>all turned quickly, only to see that Godfather had taken his place in the middle.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of the thousands of people present noticed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, Matthew, and the others glanced at each other in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many top Class AAA masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of them </span><span>noticed</span><span> how Godfather had come in and appeared in the middle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't dare to think too much and quickly greeted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather waved his hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn&rsquo;t until then that e</span><span>veryone dared to size him up seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared quite elderly, yet his eyes remained sharp. Gazing at him was like observing a bulldog that never quit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lounged comfortably on the soft seat, holding a sleek black cat in one hand and gently stroking it with his fingers. With his slicked-back hair, black suit, and black bow tie, he looked like a gentleman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to him was a black and gold scepter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, Matthew, and the others fixed their eyes on the scepter</span><span>,</span><span> and</span><span> their breathing</span><span> immediately </span><span>became heavy</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that whoever obtained the scepter could become Godfather's successor, inheriting all his powers and becoming the new Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather glanced at everyone and smiled, "It's just a birthday celebration, which happens every year. Thank you for making it so grand. In this case, let's get started."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me be clear, I don't accept gifts!</span><span> </span><span>No matter whose gift it is, don't bring it up. Otherwise, leave on your own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His request surprised many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people present had all carefully picked some gifts for Godfather, b</span><span>ut they did not dare to disobey him and could only put away the gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, why didn't you invite me to your birthday party? I came here uninvited. You're not going to send me away, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the birthday party was about to start, an exaggerated laugh suddenly echoed from outside the door. The members of the Augustine family instantly grew furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Godfather's birthday party. Who dared to laugh so wildly?</span><span> </span><span>How dared he call Godfather by his name?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all baffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All members of the Augustine family turned their gaze to the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people strolled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader was Everett Rosenthal</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> man</span><span> around Godfather&rsquo;s age</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was tall, like a giant, exuding a powerful aura. He ignored everyone else in the Augustine family and focused solely on Godfather with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He directed his sharp, sword-like gaze at Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him was a group of young men and women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their different appearances, each exuded an extremely formidable aura and was brimming with arrogance. They responded to the Augustine family's glares with disdain and contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather frowned at Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He narrowed his eyes and stared straight into Everett's eyes. Suddenly, everyone sensed a chill and a terrifying wave of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Everett and Godfather snorted coldly in unison, and the </span><span>tension</span><span> eased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather said, "Everett, I didn't expect you to come to Rosmandi. You should have told me earlier. After all, it's my place, and I should have picked you up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett smiled, "Sebastian, I dare not ask you to pick me up. You are the Godfather of Rosmandi. I don't </span><span>deserve that</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>But I heard that it is your birthday, so I couldn't help but come over. You won't </span><span>chase us away</span><span>, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather replied, "Please take a seat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then h</span><span>e had a row of seats arranged opposite him for Everett and his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Augustine family was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Everett and his men seriously, guessing the identity of this person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from Godfather&rsquo;s attitude, they could tell that he dared not offend the uninvited guest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know who he is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Lance suddenly said solemnly, "He is Everett Windsor, the legendary master from Yalynch and the head of the Windsor family, the most powerful divine family there!</span><span> </span><span>He and Godfather are both Class S Supreme Overlords!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was shocked</span><span>, l</span><span>ook</span><span>ing</span><span> at Everett in disbelief.</span></p><div class="pagination">
