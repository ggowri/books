  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go in by yourself. I don't like that empty feeling of nothingness inside. Just pick a cell and lock yourself in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Matthew spoke, he tossed Osborne a set of keys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne forcefully pushed open the dungeon's heavy door, raising an eyebrow but saying nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a deep corridor appeared before Osborne, devoid of any light, resembling an entrance to the abyss, where nothing could be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before even stepping inside, Osborne felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he didn't hesitate and stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he entered the corridor, it felt like stepping into another world, a world without sound, without light. Even activating his Satan's Eye, he could see nothing nor sense any energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, who had absorbed eight types of energy essences and could manipulate them, now felt nothing, no wind elemental, water elemental, plant elemental, or even space elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if space itself had died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silence was so profound that he couldn't even hear his own heartbeat, a sensation that felt like the world had withered away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as though everything had ceased to exist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This uncomfortable feeling was like a non-swimmer thrown into the water, uncomfortable everywhere, only wishing to escape quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned around only to find that the dungeon door had closed silently at some point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't hear the sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, since I'm already here, I might as well make the best of it and look deeper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne could not feel any direction, as if space no longer existed. He was merely moving deeper into the dungeon guided by his instincts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, a glow appeared before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to him, the dark corridor began to sparkle with stars overhead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This surprised Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't even noon when he entered the dungeon. The sun had been high in the sky. He thought, "How has it suddenly become a starry sky? Has a day already passed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering the dungeon was beneath Challenge Peak, which obscured the sky, he wondered how the sky could be visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strange!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne pondered, he suddenly noticed rows of rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These must be the actual cells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the cells, it was pitch dark. Even with Satan's Eye pushed to its limits, he could barely make out twisted, tormented figures in some cells, screaming silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, Osborne decided to enter an empty cell, unlocked it with the key, and locked himself inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a powerful mental wave surged into his mind, instantly changing his expression as various vivid illusions appeared, so real that even Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like an eternity had passed, yet it might have been only a moment before he regained his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears trickled down his cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The illusions had been too real. He saw his loved ones die in his arms, his family tormented by enemies, and he could do nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't even scream, surrounded by endless agony, and he pounded his head in agony until he woke up to realize it was all an illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such terrifying illusions. My soul is very strong, and so is my mental power, but I couldn't block these illusions at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What in the world is this place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, unfortunately, unable to hear his own voice. This absolute silence almost drove him mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally understood why members of the Augustine family feared the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered himself strong-willed, but just a short time in the dungeon was unbearably uncomfortable, making him desperate to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he stayed longer, he might actually go mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly is this place? Why is it so strange?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If no one rescued him, he had to stay in this dungeon for a month, and if he couldn't figure out what was happening, he felt he couldn't last that long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered, another strange mental wave attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, although Osborne was prepared, he found he still couldn't resist and was instantly drawn into another set of illusions, watching as Clarissa died because of him. Isa went mad because of him, watching helplessly as the people he cared about died one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was too much for Osborne to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heaving, Osborne woke up and began breathing heavily, but still couldn't hear any sound, almost driving him to tear his ears off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took a long while before he calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something's not right! This is very strange!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this level of mental attack continues, I doubt I can last three days without going mad! But although others fear the dungeon, no one has gone mad after just three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly, sensing even more the peculiarity of this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young man, the stronger your soul power, the more intense the mental shocks you'll endure here! This place annihilates everything, including the soul!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, an old voice appeared in Osborne's mind.</span></p><div class="pagination">
