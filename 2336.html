  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha said, "I knew long ago that the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute couldn't defeat you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was very calm, showing no emotional fluctuation over the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute's ineffectiveness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To her, the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute was a weapon for dealing with the weak. She knew it was very difficult to use it against a true warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was very different from Horace. Horace relied heavily on the Frost-invoking Canvas. Once the Frost-invoking Canvas lost its effect, Horace's strength would drop significantly, even to the level of Broderick and Benson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Agatha never overly relied on the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even without the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute, her strength wouldn't be greatly affected and would still remain top-notch. This is also why she could easily defeat Horace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha gripped the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute tightly, staring at Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow and Sacred Power Arrow, still full of strong fighting intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Come on! Let me see your strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will grant your wish," Osborne responded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne released the bowstring. The Sacred Power Arrow, infused with the Divine Ascendance Technique, was instantly shot out and reached Agatha in a flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha reacted swiftly. The Phoenix Cry Bone Flute in her hand became her weapon. She instantly struck it against the Sacred Power Arrow, unleashing a surge of power. The Sacred Power Arrow and the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute immediately locked in a stalemate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the Sacred Power Arrow shattered completely, and Agatha's Phoenix Cry Bone Flute was also shaken away. Agatha kept retreating, dispersing the terrifying force from just now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could steady herself, three more Sacred Power Arrows shot toward her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew it was impossible to defeat a warrior like Agatha with just one arrow, so he didn't even look at the result of the first shot and immediately drew the bowstring again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three Sacred Power Arrows infused with the Divine Ascendance Technique instantly reached Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Agatha remained calm. She kept swinging the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute, blocking all the Sacred Power Arrows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the power of the Sacred Power Arrow exceeded Agatha's expectations. After blocking two of the arrows, the other pierced through her defensive net.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, twelve Phoenix Skeletal Shields appeared around her, precisely blocking the Sacred Power Arrow. The arrow exploded instantly, its energy scattering wildly in all directions, but it didn't harm Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But next, ten more Sacred Power Arrows shot toward her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Agatha's expression changed. She could feel the immense power of Osborne's Sacred Power Arrows. Such powerful arrows must require gathering all his strength. Attacks like these consume a lot of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne seemed unconcerned about the consumption of Sacred Power. Every arrow he shot was at full force. Was he not worried that once his Sacred Power was exhausted, he would be defeated?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's mind was racing, but her movements didn't slow. The Phoenix Cry Bone Flute suddenly burst into a dazzling light, swiftly sweeping forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Four Sacred Power Arrows instantly shattered in the light of the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute. But the remaining six easily pierced through the defensive net, striking the Phoenix Skeletal Shield again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A massive explosion echoed, and the Phoenix Skeletal Shield shook violently but remained unbroken. However, the immense impact caused some chaos. Agatha's face turned pale as she kept retreating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She finally stopped after pressing the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute against the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha looked at Osborne, her eyes filled with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was also looking at Agatha with some shock at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "My arrows were actually blocked?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne held nothing back this time, unleashing his full Sacred Power and firing ten Sacred Power Arrows at once. But Agatha blocked them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among those with a similar cultivation level as Osborne, Agatha was the first to achieve this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Others were either defeated by the first arrow or by a three-arrow volley. Almost no one had the chance to face Osborne's ten-arrow barrage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before this, no one could withstand the ten-arrow barrage. Agatha was the first to do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're truly impressive," Osborne sincerely praised. "Among those at the same cultivation level as me, you're the first to block my ten-arrow barrage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Agatha couldn't help but glance at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Are you praising me or yourself? To be honest, you're also the first at the same cultivation level to push me back continuously and make me this embarrassed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No. You and I are not at the same cultivation level; you're only Ascension Nine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Agatha paused for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her words made everyone's expressions change. Osborne's previously displayed strength was so overwhelming that everyone had overlooked Osborne's cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until Agatha mentioned it that they suddenly realized Osborne's cultivation level was only Ascension Nine, not Quasi Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this was one of the reasons why Zephyr State ranked Osborne at 108th during the initial ranking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one could have imagined that Osborne at Ascension Nine would be this powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne awkwardly touched his nose. "There's not much difference between Ascension Nine and Ascension Ten. Anyway, you're impressive. But your previous performance wasn't your full strength, right? At least, I know there's a power you haven't used yet. So, next, show me your full strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha took a deep breath. "You're right. I haven't given it my all. But without you, I wouldn't have this power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I had met you seven days ago, I might have been defeated by you. But now, feel my newfound power for yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Agatha suddenly became serious. Her entire demeanor changed, appearing mysterious and noble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A faint black mist enveloped her entire body. Then, a pair of massive black wings quickly appeared behind her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those are Dark Phoenix Wings!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's Dark Phoenix Bloodline accidentally awakened because of Osborne, making her the only Dark Phoenix in this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In ancient times, the Dark Phoenix was the oldest, strongest, noblest, and most mysterious existence in the Ember Phoenix Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Becoming the Dark Phoenix, although Agatha hasn't ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame yet, she is already stronger than before. Even her Sacred Power has turned black due to the Dark Phoenix Bloodline.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the black mist even enveloped the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Phoenix Skeletal Shield, making these already top-tier Sacred Artifacts even more powerful and eerie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the Dark Phoenix Wings gently flapped. Instantly, the entire void seemed to tremble, and a terrifying aura erupted from Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene caused everyone watching around to turn pale with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man exclaimed in shock, "What? Agatha transformed? Her aura is so powerful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman agreed, "So Agatha wasn't even serious when fighting us. Her aura now is at least three times stronger than before. This is terrifying."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another man added, "Her Sacred Power is black. I feel like her Sacred Power is almost on par with a true Empyrean Sacredness warrior."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The pressure she's giving me now is even greater than that from some newly advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was utterly shocked, even Osborne's expression changed, staring at Agatha with extreme seriousness.</span></p><div class="pagination">
