  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo could not afford the failure of Osborne's enslavement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, Osborne was a precious gem. Gerardo put Osborne into the culture tank and let him absorb the energy of the culture medium to continue to improve, just like polishing and carving the gem with the best craftsmanship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the enslavement was successful, Osborne would become a perfect, unique, and priceless treasure for Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if the it failed, it would be like a gem missing after all those efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo absolutely couldn't accept the failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added, "We can only succeed. If the culture medium is not enough, just put thousand-year-old creatures, precious minerals, and god's heart blood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The technician hesitated. "But there is little god's heart blood left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo frowned. "Once I extract the god's heart blood again, the power of these gods' corpses will be weakened and even reduce my strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. To get a perfect Human Slave, some sacrifices must be made."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo left quickly. He had to go to the place where the gods' corpses were stored to extract the gods' heart blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Aniston, where are you going in such a hurry?" A female voice suddenly sounded from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo stopped and looked back. He smiled, "Oh, Ophelia. You came out. Hey, you've actually reached Class AAA. Amazing! It won't be long before you surpass me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Ophelia in shock. In his eyes, the only person who was more talented than Osborne was Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia only took a few months to transform from an ordinary person into a Class AAA metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, her power was the unique time power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia said, "It's just Class AAA. I heard that Osborne killed my senior not long ago. With my current strength, I'm afraid I would still not be Osborne's opponent. There is no way for me to retaliate against him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ophelia said this, a cold light flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had not forgotten Osborne's indifference to her. She worked so hard to improve her strength. The only purpose was to take revenge on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to become stronger than him and let him regret being indifferent to her and refusing to remarry her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would let him beg for her forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's breathing became short when she thought of this, and she clenched her fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, Ophelia continued, "Mr. Aniston, you haven't told me why you are so anxious. I have some questions about my practice and would like to ask for your help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had a strange look. He knew Ophelia's hatred for Osborne, and he knew very well that she wanted to take revenge on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Gerardo would not tell Ophelia that he had captured Osborne and put him into the Human Slave culture tank, and that Osborne would soon become his Human Slave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo replied casually, "I'm going to extract some of the god's heart blood. When I have time, I will come to you and solve your doubts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why in such a hurry?" Ophelia frowned. She couldn't wait to improve her strength and break through Class S as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, she would be confident to return to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> to find Osborne and defeat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would definitely stun Osborne with her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo smiled awkwardly, "I'm indeed quite busy. You know that I have been planning to return to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> recently. Well, just go back and continue your training. I will come to you when I have time." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he left quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia frowned and looked at Gerardo's back. She always felt that Gerardo was a little weird today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, "Extract the god's heart blood? Is Mr. Aniston going to prepare a </span><span>second perfect culture medium? The first hasn't been used yet. Who is qualified to use it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia suddenly felt curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked towards the Human Slave culturing room. She had been there once before, so she was very familiar with it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She soon arrived at the door, but when she wanted to go in, she was stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, you can&rsquo;t come in." Two expressionless "Human Slaves" guarded the door to the human slave culture tank room, which was ironic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia frowned. "Even I can't go in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Human Slaves nodded indifferently. "The master said that no one can go in except him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was surprised, becoming more certain that there must be a secret in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment and then suddenly took action. "Still!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia pointed at them, and the two men suddenly stopped moving. The time seemed to be frozen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was not for her, who could still move freely. Everyone around her stopped in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia passed them and walked into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, she saw Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
