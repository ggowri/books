  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne temporarily stopped practicing, opened Satan's Eye, and looked </span><span>at </span><span>the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The simple door could not block the X-ray vision of Satan's Eye, and he immediately saw that the person knocking on the door was his nominal sister, Yulissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What made Osborne embarrassed was that while he saw through the door, he also saw through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every curve of Yulissa's body was now exposed to his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had already gotten used to this kind of situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Touching his nose, he suppressed the embarrassment and glanced at the handle of the door. Then, it opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Please come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa entered</span><span>, looking weary</span><span>. Obviously, she did not get enough rest. There was some hesitation and entanglement on her pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Osborne, good morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at her with a frown and said, "Yulissa, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Biting her lip, Yulissa looked determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I heard that you already know who killed </span><span>my </span><span>father. It was the Ghost Ship, right? He is a Class A- metahuman, and only the mysterious Ghost Ship has the power to assassinate him!" Yulissa was a little agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked to Osborne and grabbed his arm. "Osborne, I want revenge! I can't let him die in vain. As his daughter, I must help him avenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "Yulissa, calm down, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa took a deep breath, nodded, and tried not to get too excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Whether your father was killed by them, we still lack evidence. We can only say that it is very likely. And since we can't find the Ghost Ship, we can only wait for them to attack us first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, then..." Yulissa became conflicted again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sighing, he broke the ice. "Yulissa, I know what you came here for, but you don't have to worry about it. I promise if the murderer of your father is really the Ghost Ship, I will help you destroy it and avenge your father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Yulissa looked at Osborne excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was shaking violently, and tears were sparkling in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you! I knew you would help me. I knew it! Although you are not my biological brother, I felt very close to you when I first saw you," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said this, Yulissa bit her lips again. The blush spread from her face to her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her next move also stunned Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa immediately undressed and let her clothes fall to the ground, revealing her beautiful and sexy body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, it's the only way I can thank you, I..." She </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Osborne finally realized what she tried to do and quickly turned his head away, looking helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yulissa, what are you doing</span><span>?</span><span>!</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My current identity is your biological brother! You don't have to be like this. I promised to help your father get revenge not for any reward, not to mention insult you like this!</span><span> </span><span>Put on your clothes now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa was stunned. She didn't expect that after she had mustered all her courage to present herself naked to Osborne, all the response she got was his rejection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip. "Do I look terrible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said helplessly, "It has nothing to do with this. You should already know that I have a crush. Her name is Clarissa, and I will marry her in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa said, "But you're not my real brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does it matter? As long as you regard of me as your brother, we can be a family. Anyway, put your clothes on now, you don't have to do this," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa bit her lip and finally gave up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Putting on the clothes with a red face, she whispered, "You are the one who doesn't want me. Don't regret it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>was overwhelmed by mixed feelings,</span><span> so, he chose to remain silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Osborne, I'll go back first." After saying that, Yulissa ran away with a red face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she left, Osborne quickly closed the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said to himself, "That's so ridiculous! This girl really wants to avenge her father too eagerly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, stopped thinking about it, and prepared to continue practicing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as he closed his eyes, what emerged in his mind was the image of Yulissa standing naked in front of him, which made him restless and unable to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That feeling was completely different from the feeling Osborne accidentally saw her body in X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact of the pictures was completely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. I'd better take a walk outside." Osborne simply stopped practicing and walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Yulissa lived in a suite with two rooms and a living room. At this time, Yulissa was still in the living room. When she saw Osborne coming out, her pretty face turned red again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Osborne, she was the shy</span><span>er</span><span> one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she forced herself to suppress her strange feeling and walked over and hugged Osborne's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, where are you going? I want to go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Osborne could feel Yulissa's breasts pressing against his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was suddenly embarrassed again.</span></p><div class="pagination">
