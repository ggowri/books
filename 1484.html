  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Super VIP of the slave market, Osborne's request for a private room was quickly accommodated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tiana, make sure no one disturbs me! And find a place for my men to rest," he instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana nodded. "Of course, but just a head-up&mdash;there are only three hours left until we close for the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even as a Super VIP, you can't stay here indefinitely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," Osborne replied, waving her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and Darren exchanged puzzled glances. "Mr. Lachlan Swift, what do you need a private room for?" they asked in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled subtly, a glint of determination in his eyes. "I feel like I'm on the verge of a breakthrough! I just need a moment to focus, and when I come out, I might have a way to deal with Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the meantime, keep watch at the door and don't let anyone interrupt me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and Darren were taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to break through to the Celestial Deity level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, the four Divine Flames flickering above his head suggested he was close, but they didn't realize that Osborne was merely using the Eclipsing Mantra to disguise his true power, which was actually at the Superior Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to his Infinite Devouring Eyes, even without actively training, Osborne's strength had been steadily increasing. However, breaking through from Superior Deity to Transcendent Deity would still require some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he needed a private room was to maintain his cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His outward appearance of power was still too low, and he needed to project a stronger image.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had the upper hand even against Celestial Deity warriors, so he decided to change his disguise to make it seem like he had reached that level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, while this change would enhance his appearance, it wouldn't actually boost his strength enough to confront Fabian directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had another plan in mind that would require a little time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside the private room, he locked the door and surrounded himself with a protective barrier using divine power, ensuring that no one could eavesdrop on what transpired within. Then, he got to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, Osborne activated the Eclipsing Mantra, transforming the four green Divine Flames above his head into five azure flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This change signified his elevation to the Celestial Deity level, and his Divine Body had reached Level Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Celestial Deity with a Level Five Divine Body would certainly stand out among the younger generation in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, my position in the Wild Flame Army will be easier to elevate! Reaching Celestial Deity means I'd at least be a centurion! With the right backing, I could even become a chiliarch or a leader of ten thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just look at Lachlan's uncle, Calvin; he's a Celestial Deity and already a chiliarch in the Wild Flame Army. Those Celestial Deity warriors from the Demonic Dragon Clan, Soaring Lion Clan, or Mystic Feather Clan are often leaders of ten thousand or even generals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By disguising my level as Celestial Deity, I can facilitate my upcoming plans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he knew that merely changing his disguise wouldn't alter his actual strength. He still lacked the ability to confront Deity Overlord Fabian directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne unleashed all his hidden cards, defeating Fabian would be impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, if he needed to escape, he could manage that easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, if it were just him, slipping away from Fabian's pursuit would be a walk in the park. But with the Spark of Blaze members in tow, many of his tactics became impractical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, his spatial power and dark power were off-limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his current guise as Lachlan from the Swift family, he hadn't activated those abilities, so he couldn't use them in front of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only power he could freely wield was Thunder Power&mdash;because that was the only one Lachlan had access to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "Thunder Power... There was a time when I focused on Thunder Power as my primary ability, but I eventually shifted my attention to spatial and dark powers. Still, my Thunder Power is stronger than most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, my lightning elemental essence has reached Level Four! What's more, it's mutated, making it significantly more potent than the average Thunder Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even a mutated Level Four essence isn't enough. I need to push it further&mdash;at least to Level Five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once my lightning elemental essence hits that level, my speed will skyrocket. Then, I might actually be able to match Fabian in a battle of speed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But getting it to Level Five won't be easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, I still have the core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recalled the time he had been trapped in that deep space. To escape, he had extracted five core energies from the Lotus, hoping to forcibly elevate his spatial elemental essence to Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could use them, that terrifying root creature had appeared, forcing him to abandon his plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, five core energies remained, and Osborne knew he had to be strategic with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This might be my last batch of core energy; I need to conserve it! I'll use one of them to enhance my lightning elemental essence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With determination, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
