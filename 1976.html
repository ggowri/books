  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity drew on its power to impose an absolute forbidden zone, a space where no one could unleash strength beyond a certain limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the perfect aspect of the zone's effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the reality was that casting such a zone had its limitations. If an opponent's cultivation level exceeded Osborne's by too much, they could potentially shatter the restrictions and unleash even greater power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the case with Icy Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine, an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, towered above Osborne by four ranks. As a result, the effectiveness of the absolute forbidden zone diminished significantly. He managed to break through most of the constraints, restoring himself to Ascension Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm only being held back Ascension One strength by this ridiculous zone!" Icy Nine spat, anger flaring in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Bram, too, was struggling against the limits of the absolute forbidden zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Formerly an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, he now felt the weight of being restricted to only Ascension One. Agitation bubbled inside him, and despite his desperate attempts to break free, he could only manage to boost himself back to Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned pale as he glanced at Icy Nine, who had regained some of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least in Icy Nine, Bram took a small comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Icy Nine should be strong enough to handle him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne observed the unfolding situation with a calculating gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "Looks like this absolute forbidden zone can only affect those who exceed my cultivation by four levels or less. Just like Icy Nine, he's barely affected but still has some limitations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to climb to Ascension Six, this zone might not touch him at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as for Bram, who is three levels above me, he's being effectively restrained, almost perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone higher than two levels than me wouldn't definitely break free."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced as he contemplated their strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine tried again, but the restrictions held firm. His eyes narrowed in shock as he stared at Osborne, icy fury radiating from him. "What kind of trick is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged nonchalantly. "Just my way of getting rid of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine erupted with laughter, confidence evident. "You think that by suppressing my level from Ascension Five to Ascension Four you can take me down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even with this limitation, I can still wipe you off the map! Remember, I'm not some weakling like Bram!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "Is that so? Let's see you try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he launched into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maintaining the absolute forbidden zone ate away at his energy. The longer it lasted, the more detrimental it would be for him, so he had to finish this quickly and deal with both Icy Nine and Bram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Multi-Thunder Chainstorm! Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne invoked two Divine Ascendance Techniques, summoning a tempest that enveloped both Icy Nine and Bram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the while, he gripped his Bloodwrought Bow, drawing it taut as he prepared to unleash its deadly arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here it comes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash of battle erupted once more, but this time, Osborne faced a far more formidable opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Icy Nine was currently subdued to Ascension Four, his strength far surpassed Bram's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to die!" Icy Nine growled, unwilling to back down or dodge, opting instead to face the onslaught of Shadow Drakes head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swiftly smashed them apart, not even breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Drakes, though numerous, were slow on their own. Without a significant mass, they posed little threat to Icy Nine, who effortlessly shattered them one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the bolts of lightning raining down, Bram had handled those easily before&mdash;there was no way they would faze Icy Nine either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow posed a real danger, albeit a limited one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine broke another dark energy arrow with a flick of his wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The contemptuous smile on his face reflected his unwavering confidence as he locked eyes with Osborne. "If that's all you've got, then you might as well prepare for death! Are you really just all talk? You think you can kill me with that level of power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show me your true strength! If I remember correctly, your specialty lies in spatial power, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed at Icy Nine's taunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to see my real strength? Fine, I'll give you a show you won't forget!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he drew his Bloodwrought Bow once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, however, he infused it with spatial energy, and a transparent spatial arrow materialized on the bowstring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's three primary elemental powers had always been balanced, but after acquiring the Spatial Gold Crystal in deep space, his spatial elemental essence had surged from early Level Nine to late Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, his spatial power far surpassed his dark and thunder powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, when facing Bram, Osborne had felt a watchful presence lurking in the shadows and had refrained from using his spatial power, keeping his true strength hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But against Icy Nine, who was significantly stronger than Bram, he knew he had to unleash his spatial power to stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This will be my first full-force attack since my breakthrough in spatial elemental essence! I'll soon see just how powerful it has become!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished his thought, spatial energy surged wildly around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow on the Bloodwrought Bow glowed ominously, casting a terrifying light that made Icy Nine's expression harden. A sense of foreboding crept into his heart, and an inexplicable fear began to take root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That fear ignited a spark of anger within Icy Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I am Icy Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Nine Dark Sovereigns under the esteemed Lord Malevolence! How could I possibly feel fear toward a mere junior? No matter how strong he claims to be, he's still just a kid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, my cultivation level is far superior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'll never be my match! Bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce glare, Icy Nine locked eyes with Osborne, determination radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne released the bowstring, and the spatial arrow shot forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow vanished into thin air the instant it left the bow, disappearing from Icy Nine's sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in the blink of an eye, it reappeared right in front of him as if it had teleported.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force of the arrow pierced directly toward his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine had no time to react. He hadn't anticipated that Osborne's spatial arrow could move in such a way. With no other option, he braced himself to take the hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He managed to summon his divine power just in time, but the spatial arrow struck him with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying explosion of spatial energy erupted around Icy Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very fabric of space around him twisted and collapsed, creating visible whirlpools and even miniature black holes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming power forced its way through Icy Nine's divine power defenses, leaving him severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blood-curdling scream tore from Icy Nine's lips as his chest shattered like glass, creating a massive gaping wound. The internal chaos within him was violently disrupted by the frenzied spatial energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one arrow, Icy Nine was gravely wounded!</span></p><div class="pagination">
