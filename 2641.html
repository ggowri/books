  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Celestial Spire, exchanging treasures and resources with battle points has one major drawback: it all depends on what Osborne knows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he could name the item, he could probably exchange for it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if he doesn't know what to exchange for, Celestial Spire won't provide him with a list to choose from.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is currently facing this dilemma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He has a huge amount of battle points but has no idea what to exchange for. Even 200 drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir only cost him 200 billion battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His battle points still amount to 3.13 trillion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How to spend these battle points is a real problem!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "If I had known, I should have learned more from Primordial! I have no idea what treasures the cosmos holds, so I can't exchange anything from Toby."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could I just make something up?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head, dismissing the idea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe I can only exchange for some Imperial Artifacts!" Osborne said helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you decided what to exchange for?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby didn't rush Osborne, nor did he give him any hints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his view, a Human like Osborne, born in the edge regions of the cosmos, couldn't possibly know what truly valuable things are.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fact that he knew about the Perfect Dragon Elixir already surprised Toby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now Osborne looked conflicted, clearly unsure of what to exchange for.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and asked, "How many battle points are needed to exchange for the best Imperial Artifact armor?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "The most basic low-grade Imperial Artifact requires 5 billion battle points! A mid-grade Imperial Artifact requires 50 billion battle points! A top-grade Imperial Artifact requires 500 billion battle points! An Ultimate Imperial Artifact requires 5 trillion battle points! The best supreme Imperial Artifact requires 50 billion battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the armor you mentioned is twice as expensive as regular Imperial Artifacts due to its complex forging process."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With your current battle points, you can exchange for three top-grade Imperial Artifact armors! But I advise against it, because not to mention top-grade Imperial Artifact armors, you can't even use low-grade Imperial Artifact armors right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The moment you put on a top-grade Imperial Artifact armor, your body would collapse first! With your Sacred Power, you can't even activate a top-grade Imperial Artifact armor, so exchanging for it is pointless! If your strength improves a bit, you might be able to use a low-grade Imperial Artifact armor..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sighed helplessly and said, "Can't I use it later? Once I leave here, I won't have anywhere to exchange it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby smiled and said, "That's not the case! You can still come back in the future! You've passed the twenty-seventh level's trial, so you've earned a second chance to enter the Celestial Spire!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Cultivation Shackle of the Celestial Spire has loosened its restrictions on you... Before your cultivation level reaches Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, you can come back to the Celestial Spire once more to continue the trials you haven't completed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If next time you can pass the fifty-fourth level of the Celestial Spire, you'll gain a third chance to enter the Celestial Spire, and the Cultivation Shackle will be further loosened!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In short, every time you complete twenty-seven levels of trials, you gain an additional chance to enter the Celestial Spire!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said in surprise, "I can enter the Celestial Spire a second time? As long as I don't exceed Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I can come back again to continue the trials and earn battle points?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said excitedly, "That's awesome!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Celestial Spire has ninety-nine levels but restricts entry to those below Empyrean Sacredness, it's totally unreasonable! No matter how strong they are, it's impossible for them to clear all ninety-nine levels of trials!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So as long as I clear twenty-seven levels in one go, I can get a second chance! I can wait until my cultivation level reaches Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, or even Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, to enter the Celestial Spire again and continue from the twenty-eighth level onward..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was thrilled. This news was incredibly important to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, to him, the Celestial Spire was simply a treasure trove, a place where he could gain endless rewards as long as he was strong enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next time before I come in, I must figure out what the most precious treasures in the cosmos are and exchange for all of them!" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now he still faced a tough question&mdash;what exactly to exchange for with so many battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne asked, "Can the low-grade Imperial Artifact battle armor I exchange from you allow me to freely traverse the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign is a shortcut to deeper parts of the cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign is filled with terrifying Chrono-Spatial Turbulence. Anyone who hasn't reached Imperial Empyrean Sacredness entering the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign is almost certain to die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, anyone wanting to venture deeper into the cosmos must at least reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But on the Racial Convergence Planet, no Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior has appeared for tens of thousands of years! Otherwise, Frederick wouldn't have gone to such lengths to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket, seeking power from the Skyfall Casket to break through and become an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, though confident in himself, also worries he might not break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby replied, "Wearing the low-grade Imperial Artifact armor, you can naturally enter the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign without worrying about issues! But at most, you can only reach the middle layers of the cosmos. If you want to go deeper into the cosmos, this is far from enough..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was pleasantly surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being able to enter the middle layers of the cosmos was already quite good. If he couldn't break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness in the future, he would wear the low-grade Imperial Artifact armor, enter the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, and reach the middle layers of the cosmos!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rules in the middle layers of the cosmos are different from those at the edges. The rules there are more complete, making it easier to break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne made up his mind. "Then help me exchange for ten, no, twenty low-grade Imperial Artifact armors! I want Panoply Armor..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne not only wanted to prepare for himself but also for Clarissa and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Twenty should be enough!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twenty low-grade Imperial Artifact armors? No problem! Exchanging one requires 10 billion battle points! Twenty would be 200 billion battle points..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's battle points decreased by 200 billion, but he still had nearly 3 trillion left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He simply couldn't spend all his battle points!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne straightforwardly said, "Get me three mid-grade Imperial Artifact armors and one top-grade Imperial Artifact armor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "No problem!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One top-grade Imperial Artifact armor costs 1 trillion battle points! Three mid-grade Imperial Artifact armors cost 300 billion battle points. Now you have 1.63 trillion battle points left!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are still plenty of battle points left!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne helplessly said, "Get me forty low-grade Imperial Artifacts. Half for attack and half for defense! Among them, three sword-type Imperial Artifacts, three blade-type Imperial Artifacts, two..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne exchanged another forty low-grade Imperial Artifacts, spending another 200 billion battle points!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are still plenty of battle points left!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne thought of something and couldn't help but ask, "Can you exchange for Primordial Energy here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial Energy only exists in the Chaotic World before the cosmos was born.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Osborne consumed the Perfect Dragon Elixir, entered a special Enlightenment State, accidentally stepped into a Chaotic World, and unexpectedly absorbed a trace of Primordial Energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Primordial was incredibly envious of this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that Primordial Energy must be a treasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after he finished speaking, he noticed Toby was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "You actually know about Primordial Energy?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
