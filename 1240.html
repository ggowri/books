  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph snorted derisively, saying, "Why do we attack the League of Divine Descent? You know damn well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to buy some time, are we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic! Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Joseph plunged into the fray, and the expressions on the faces of the ten Junior Deity warriors hardened abruptly. They had indeed hoped to delay Joseph just long enough for reinforcements to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, he wasn't about to grant them that mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle erupted in a flurry of movement and chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Joseph was personally leading the charge, and the Junior Deity warriors were no match for him. One by one, they fell beneath his onslaught, their strength fading swiftly under his relentless assault. He spared only a handful for interrogation; the rest met brutal ends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's voice was icy as he towered over the remaining warriors. "Tell me where your ancestral deities are hiding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tortured warriors squirmed under the pressure, finally yielding to the relentless interrogation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mount of Gods! All of our thirty-six Divine Families have their ancestral deities hidden within the Mount of Gods!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's eyes lit up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And where is this Mount of Gods?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know!" the warrior protested, shaking his head desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Joseph's expression freeze into a mask of fury, the warrior quickly continued, "I swear, I really don't know! Only Helios Thornberry of the Thornberry family knows the exact location of Mount of Gods!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every time we go to pay our respects, it's Helios who leads us there. He puts us to sleep for the journey, so when we wake up, we're already there. I have no idea where Mount of Gods actually is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's brows knitted together in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Thornberry family of Marcelin? Helios? Tch, just a junior. I'll take care of the Thornberry family myself. We'll get the location of Mount of Gods, and I'll wipe your ancestors from existence! You're of no use to me now&mdash;time to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Joseph crushed the warrior effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Easionand's Divine Family was no more. Soon enough, reports flooded in from the other eleven teams, each confirming the destruction of their respective targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly sprang into action, fully engaged in his own pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing about the Mount of Gods, Joseph immediately scrapped his original plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He issued new orders to all the teams. "Since only the Thornberry family in Marcelin knows the location of the Mount of Gods, we're going straight for them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take out the Thornberry family, find the Mount of Gods, eliminate the ancestral gods of the League of Divine Descent, and we'll bring the whole League crashing down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, no one will be able to stand against the Deschanel family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Joseph set out for Marcelin with his forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcelin was a daunting 3000 miles from Rosmandi, separated by an ocean and far from Easionand, this distance meant little to Joseph and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without spatial powers, they could make the journey in just a few dozen minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had gathered all the blood energy left by the twelve Divine Families annihilated in the second wave of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was now brimming with potent blood energy, which thrilled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this much blood energy, I bet it's enough to let a hundred Blood Demon Vanguard members refine Divine Bone and Divine Flesh, pushing them all into godhood!" Osborne thought to himself, deciding it was time to return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When news broke of the Deschanel family's shift in strategy to target the powerful Thornberry family, Osborne felt a twinge of regret. This change meant fewer opportunities to collect blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he wouldn't miss the grand confrontation ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be decisive, determining the fates of both the League of Divine Descent and the Deschanel family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was </span><span>excit</span><span>ed to witness the outcome firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gods of the Deschanel family needed some time to reach Marcelin, which provided Osborne enough time to return briefly to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll use this window to let the Blood Demon Vanguard attempt their breakthrough to godhood," Osborne murmured before teleporting back to the Augustine Bastion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, in the fortress' second-level training chamber, a hundred Blood Demon Vanguard members gathered, eyes shining with anticipation as they looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled at them and asked, "Have you all mastered the Phoenix Ascension technique I taught you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd nodded eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, we've got it down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pleased, Osborne nodded in return. Once he had acquired the Phoenix Ascension technique, Osborne used a special method to impart it to all the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given their rather ordinary talents, if they followed the usual path to refine Divine Bone and Divine Flesh, most would end up with only a Level One Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a select few would manage to forge a Level Two Divine Body, which, in Osborne's eyes, was simply not sufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Phoenix Ascension changed everything. Using it to forge a Divine Body could enhance their creations by two levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those destined for a Level One Divine Body could leap to Level Three, while those at Level Two could reach Level Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Three and Level Four Divine Bodies were impressively powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the Age of Gods, only the most prodigious could hope to forge such sublime forms.</span></p><div class="pagination">
