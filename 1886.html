  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary ignored Trevor, turning to Alicia and Nadia. "Come on, let's get out of here! I told you not to come and watch the show, and look what happened&mdash;you almost got killed! Just wait until Dad gets back; he'll have a few choice words for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alicia and Nadia exchanged eye rolls, silently thinking, "Wasn't it you who asked us to keep an eye on things? And now you're lecturing us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they knew Zachary was just playing a part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood that "Theodore" was actually Osborne. When Osborne had been trapped in Trevor's Universe-Sealing Formation, they had felt helpless, unable to reach out for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Zachary had arrived with the Hudson family warriors just in time to break the formation, allowing them to breathe a sigh of relief when they saw Osborne had escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were ready to play along with Zachary's act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Trevor with icy glares, they declared, "Trevor, we've already introduced ourselves, yet you still tried to kill us! The Hudson family won't forget this! When our father returns from the esteemed God of Light, we'll make sure to tell him everything! We might even take it all the way to the esteemed God of Light herself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's expression darkened further at their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Zachary prepared to leave, a fierce glint flashed in Trevor's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold it right there! You didn't come here just to break my Universe-Sealing Formation to save them, did you? The person you really wanted to rescue was 'Theodore,' wasn't it? I must admit, you've succeeded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's heart raced at the accusation, but he maintained a calm facade. "I don't know what you're talking about! I don't even know who 'Theodore' is. I'm only here to save my sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor scoffed. "You think that little lie will fool me? You can't possibly claim you don't know who 'Theodore' is! He's the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I remember correctly, you have a sister named Vivienne. Twenty years ago, she vanished from the Hudson family for a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That man's name? 'Theodore'!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The same Theodore who leads the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings. And to top it off, there's another member of the Seven Young Deity Kings with the exact same name as your sister&mdash;Vivienne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, is it safe to say that Theodore is actually your sister's husband?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are right under your nose in the Hudson family's place? Who would've thought that after all these years, your long-lost sister and her husband would come back, especially with the title of the Seven Young Deity Kings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's gaze turned icy, his voice dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings just killed one of the Paramount Supreme Clan's Five Brilliant Scions&mdash;Caesar. The Paramount Supreme Clan is out for blood! Tell me, what do you think will happen if they find out the Seven Young Deity Kings are hiding in your place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a mocking smile spread across Trevor's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary and the others exchanged worried glances, their faces darkening with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trevor, I have no idea what you're on about! I don't know anything about the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! This is all just a coincidence&mdash;a case of mistaken identity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor laughed coldly. "Still trying to wriggle out of it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's fine! Even if I were to believe this is all just a coincidence, do you really think the Paramount Supreme Clan would accept that explanation? Do you think they'd hesitate to strike first and ask questions later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's face turned stony, his jaw clenching as he faced Trevor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Trevor, you're planning to spill the beans about the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings potentially being in our place to the Paramount Supreme Clan? The Seven Young Deity Kings are the rising stars of our community&mdash;super geniuses that even the esteemed God of Light praises as the future of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to hand over their location to the Paramount Supreme Clan? Are you betraying the Human Community?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor erupted in laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, come on, Zachary. Don't go accusing me so casually! Even your father would need evidence to make such claims! The fact that the Seven Young Deity Kings might be hiding in your place isn't just something I know; plenty of people are aware of it. If that news gets to the Paramount Supreme Clan, how will you prove I was the one who told them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are so many witnesses here&mdash;it could have been anyone! And what if there's a traitor within the Hudson family? Maybe one of your own spilled the secret!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sly smile laced with menace, Trevor continued, "In any case, I have a strong feeling that the Paramount Supreme Clan will know about the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings being in your place very soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's fists tightened, his irritation boiling beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! If you think the Seven Young Deity Kings are in our place, then let it be! Even if the Paramount Supreme Clan catches wind of it, what of it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they dare send someone to hunt them down at our home, they'll find out we're not to be trifled with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Hudson family has never bowed before the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're leaving now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a response, Zachary turned on his heel and led the entire Hudson family contingent away in haste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor snorted derisively, watching them with a cold glare but making no move to stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured to himself, a sinister grin creeping across his face, "Looks like the Hudson family is truly connected to the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, then they can all go down together."</span></p><div class="pagination">
