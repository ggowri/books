  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Guy's cooperation, Osborne found it incredibly easy to infiltrate and devour his battalion of 10 thousand warriors without fear of exposure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His plan was straightforward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside Guy's expansive office, he would establish a potent divine power barrier to isolate the room from the outside world. Then, under the pretense of a meeting, he would bring in the Wild Flame Army warriors in groups, all the while waiting inside the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the combined power of Osborne and Guy, two Deity Overlord level warriors, they could easily subdue anyone who entered and forcibly transform them into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as they managed the numbers carefully, resistance would be futile, and suspicion would never arise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once everything was laid out, Osborne and Guy sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instructed, "Let's start with the chiliarchs. Gather them here under the pretext of a meeting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy had nine chiliarchs under his command, although one had been lost in a previous assignment to support Divine Peak Nine, falling victim to the Deathborn army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This left him with just eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Bruno now transformed into a Blood Clan member, they only had to face these eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The lowest-ranked chiliarch was at the early stage of Celestial Deity, while the highest was at the peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Attempting to subdue all eight Celestial Deity warriors would be no small feat for Osborne. A single misstep could easily unravel the operation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, with Guy's assistance, the task became manageable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy suggested that they poison the water the chiliarchs would drink. Given that these men were his most trusted confidants, they would have little reason to be suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne found this idea appealing and quickly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, the eight chiliarchs entered the office, blissfully unaware of the divine power barrier surrounding them. They assumed that the discussions with Guy were confidential and should remain secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, standing in the corner of the room, raised a few eyebrows as the lowest-ranking officer present, merely a centurion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, knowing that Guy had intentions to promote him, they dismissed any doubts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything unfolded exactly as planned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy welcomed his guests with a warm smile and offered them coffee. The chiliarchs, comfortable and trusting, lifted their cups to their lips without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moments later, the poison took effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their divine power was quickly suppressed, rendering them powerless. With a signal, Osborne and Guy acted in perfect unison, swiftly overpowering the eight warriors and leaving them immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne proceeded to transform each of them into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strongest among them was merely at the peak of Celestial Deity, so they were no match for his prowess; he didn't even need to waste time shattering their divine power essences. Instead, he made the transformations effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, all of Guy's chiliarchs were now Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their loyalty and cooperation made the next phase even simpler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Following Osborne's instructions, they each sent messages to their centurions, summoning them to return to Guy's office. As the centurions arrived one by one, Osborne and the newly transformed chiliarchs wasted no time overpowering them. With their weaker prowess, the centurions found it impossible to resist the combined might of their revamped leadership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, every centurion in Guy's command had been transformed into a member of the Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next on Osborne's list were the squad leaders and the regular soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pick up the pace! Each centurion needs to go back and rally your squad members. We'll transform one hundred at a time!" Osborne commanded, his tone firm and urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each group that entered the office took about ten to twenty minutes to be subdued and transformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this rate, if everything went smoothly, Osborne estimated that he could convert all of Guy's forces in just over a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time dawn broke, Osborne had successfully transformed over 10 thousand Wild Flame Army warriors into Blood Clan members, all without raising a single suspicion among the high-ranking officials of the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the sun began to rise, he leaned back, utterly exhausted, but the thrill of his achievement coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Excitement sparkled in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "It's finally done! The Wild Flame Army consists of about 500 thousand soldiers, and now, over 10 thousand of them are loyal to me as Blood Clan! Many of these warriors come from the various clans and factions of Wild Flame City. Through them, I can keep a close eye on the movements of these groups!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This step went even smoother than I could have hoped! At this rate, it won't be long before I can transform the entire Wild Flame Army into Blood Clan members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But, given my current strength, facing the army's vice generals would be a challenge, and I'm nowhere near ready to take on the generals, deputy commanders, or the commander himself. I need to power up first!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
