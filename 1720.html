  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's small face was taut with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I won't let you talk like that! In my eyes, you're the best person in the world! No one can compare to you! The God of Night? He doesn't hold a candle to you! I believe that anyone who truly loves you feels the same way</span><span>, </span><span>just like I do</span><span>, </span><span>and would never betray you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished speaking, everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a moment to gather himself and managed a smile. "Alright, I appreciate that. I'll handle this in my own time; it's not a big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's get back to business!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What were we discussing before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his effort to shift the conversation, it was clear that Osborne's mind was still in turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing this, the group decided to let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no point in dwelling on it; this was something only Osborne could resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, we got sidetracked! Bryce, didn't you say you had a way for us to make our names known quickly in Celestara? Do you really have a plan?" Kendra asked, her impatience directed at Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group turned their attention to Bryce, who grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, right! As Hannah mentioned earlier, there are only a handful of people who are truly well-known in Celestara, and they're all top-tier Deity Kings. Compared to them, we're way out of our league. No matter what we do, we can't hope to achieve that level of fame</span><span>, </span><span>not even if we all break through to become Deity Kings ourselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, our best bet is to leverage their prestige!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others exchanged puzzled glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leverage? Whose prestige?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes suddenly lit up. "Are you suggesting we use the fame of the Seven Great Deity Kings from the Human Community?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce clapped his hands together. "Exactly! You're sharp, Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're going to ride on the coattails of the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community. Count us up</span><span>. H</span><span>ow many do we have here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra's face brightened. "One, two, three... seven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you saying we should pose as the Seven Great Deity Kings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce rolled his eyes. "Come on now, those are the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no way we could pull that off! Besides, five of them are already dead! What I'm suggesting is that we form a group called... the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we can take down as many famous talents from the various tribes as possible, even challenge the geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clan. If we make a name for ourselves, people will start talking about us. They might even start thinking of us as the new Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And who knows? Our presence could remind them of the fear the original Seven Great Deity Kings instilled in them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That way, we can ride their legacy to fame in Celestara much faster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Bryce finished, everyone processed the bold idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra murmured, "The Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Challenge the talented beings from various tribes? Even take on geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can get the people of Celestara talking about us alongside the Seven Great Deity Kings and remind them of the fear those legends instilled... it sounds feasible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryce, you finally came up with a solid plan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Kendra turned her gaze toward Osborne, knowing that, ultimately, he would have to decide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne understood Bryce's intent. He had to admit that Bryce's idea was brilliant. With their current strength, making a name for themselves in a specific area of Celestara would be achievable, but making a mark across the entire region? That was a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they all broke through to become Deity Kings, that level of recognition would still be out of reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, leveraging the reputation of the Seven Great Deity Kings from the Human Community changed everything. If they could get people to discuss them in the same breath as the Great Deity Kings, their names would rise to prominence in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said thoughtfully, "I think it could work, but there are some details we need to address."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the issue?" Kendra asked, curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned slightly. "Hannah is from the Mystic Feather Clan, not the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we're using the identity of the Seven Great Deity Kings, we need to commit fully. I'll spread the word that we've received the 'legacy' of the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community. If we thrive, we'll become the pillars of the Human Community and seal Lord Malevolence once more, driving all the tribes out of Celestara!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, everyone gaped at him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't that a bit too dangerous? The various tribes might come after us, trying to take us out before we even get started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly, "Don't forget that I have spatial powers! It won't be easy for them to kill us. Worst-case scenario, I can just whisk you all away and find a place to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already thought this through. The key issue is that Hannah isn't from the Human Community, and she doesn't fit in our 'Seven Young Deity Kings' group. But I do have another candidate in mind..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
