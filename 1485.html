  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to elevate his elemental essence had proven effective in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's spatial elemental essence had reached the peak of Level Six, and his dark elemental essence had advanced to the mid-Level Six, largely thanks to the core energy he had drawn from the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without it, relying solely on his own training, reaching Level Five would have been quite an achievement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To hit Level Six at its peak could take him hundreds of years&mdash;or he might never achieve it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne resolved to use one of the core energies from the Lotus to boost his lightning elemental essence. Even in the worst-case scenario, he was confident he could elevate it from Level Four to Level Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was even a good chance he could push it into the mid or late stages of Level Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he needed time to do this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only three hours left before the slave market closed, he and the Spark of Blaze team had to leave and face the Deity Overlord, Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To expedite the process, Osborne decided to leverage his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it reached Level Seven, he could freeze time, and at Level Eight, he would be able to manipulate time, speeding it up or slowing it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with his Satan's Eye at Level Nine, he could accelerate time by up to a hundred times within a limited range without worrying too much about the drain on his divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne accelerated the time within the private room by a hundredfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that while one hour passed inside, a full hundred hours would tick away outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this setup, his lightning elemental essence would have ample time to absorb the core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and rise in level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time sped by, outside the slave market, the atmosphere was electric with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian, a Deity Overlord warrior, sat cross-legged not far from the entrance, his icy gaze fixed on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just three hours left until the slave market closes! Before that, all the guests must clear out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, you pathetic human fool, you dare to challenge me? I'll crush you with my own hands, turning your body into nothing but pulp, and then I'll devour you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce killing intent burned in Fabian's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in no rush, possessing all the patience in the world as he awaited Osborne's emergence from the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, representatives from various factions were watching the drama unfold with a mix of amusement and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Human Community lunatic must be regretting his choices right about now! How could he offend Fabian at the auction? It's like signing his own death warrant!" one observer chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He thinks being a Super VIP in the slave market grants him protection from someone like Fabian? What a naive fool!" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fabian couldn't care less about his Super VIP status. If he wants Lachlan dead, one move will be all it takes. The slave market won't be able to save him in time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan's a goner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a lowly Human Community member who got lucky finding an ancient god's treasure and a stash of Essence Crystals. He thinks he can strut around, disregarding the rest of us and even the Deity Overlord? He's asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When he's gone, those Human Community slaves he bought will be left without a master. I've already contacted my hunting team. Once that guy bites the dust, we'll swoop in and grab those slaves for a nice profit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with whispered conversations, all convinced that Osborne's confrontation with Fabian would end in disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Swift family publicly severing ties with him, no one believed he had any hope of rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, in the Swift Manor, Walter abruptly stood up, his expression darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, shock etched on his face, "What did you say?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan spent a staggering 120 million on a bunch of Human Community slaves and became a Super VIP at the slave market? That idiot has managed to offend numerous powerful factions and even angered Deity Overlord Fabian? Fabian has threatened to turn him into pulp and is now trapping him inside the slave market?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravity of the situation hit him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where on earth did that boy accumulate so many Essence Crystals? One hundred twenty million?! Even the Swift family would struggle to gather that much! And he blew it all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin, visibly distressed, responded, "Dad, I'm not sure of all the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, word is going around that Lachlan must've struck it lucky and found an ancient god's treasure vault to come into that kind of wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what should we do? Should we try to save him or play it off like this has nothing to do with us? If we step in to help, we might end up crossing powerful factions and undoubtedly earn the ire of Fabian. If he sets his sights on the Swift family, we could be in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we've already made a public declaration to sever ties with him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's brow furrowed deeper at his son's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caught in a conflict of kinship and self-preservation, Walter faced a harrowing choice&mdash;to intervene or to stand back and let fate unfold.</span></p><div class="pagination">
