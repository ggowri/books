  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is so powerful. There's something wrong with the intelligence. Fortunately, we are used to saturation attacks and have enough people. Otherwise, this action would have failed." The leading metahuman looked anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five Class A- people joined forces to besiege Osborne, but Osborne actually found an opportunity to injure one of them seriously, and the other two were also seriously injured. If they had not acted in time and trapped Osborne, that man would have died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strength was really terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kyle, he won't beak it, will he?" Eric, the martial artist who Osborne nearly killed, looked at the huge sphere in fear and asked the leading metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle smiled, "Don't worry. As long as I continue to send power and reinforce the sphere, he won't break it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle with Osborne was dangerous, but it only took a short time. They looked at each other and then looked in the direction of the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle said, "There are several outstanding young people from the Augustine family on the Alisa Ship. We can't let them go. Eric is seriously injured. He'll stay here with me and control Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leon, Daly, Rudolf, take your men over there and kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to intelligence, the Augustine family has arranged two Class A- metahumans to protect them, but their strength is very average. They are no match for the three of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill all the people on the ship as quickly as possible, and then we have to go back immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Kyle finished ordering, everyone nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for Eric, the seriously injured martial artist, the other three turned around and rushed quickly towards the Alisa Ship in the distance with nine Class B+ subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, they stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A person appeared in front of them. It was Layla who had rushed over to save Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Layla saw this group of people, her expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she left the Alisa Ship, she felt intense energy fluctuations in the distance. Obviously, a fierce battle was taking place. She was worried about Osborne and rushed over quickly. As a result, the battle was over quickly, but she met these people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Layla could see that the three leading men were masters of the same level as her. They had obviously just experienced a fierce battle, and there were blood stains on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Three Class A- masters?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They are fine. What about Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Layla suddenly panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She questioned in a cold voice, "Who are you? Where is Mr. Augustine? What have you done to him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three men looked at each other. The one who controlled the metal elemental stepped forward and sneered, "Mr. Augustine? Are you talking about that brat? You're too late. We've already killed him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Layla was stunned. She shivered, and her face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three men took advantage of this moment and quickly surrounded Layla.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Layla frowned. It was too late to escape. She had no time to sorrow for Osborne's death. Her face became solemn instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked, "Who are you? Why are you targeting the Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man sneered, "Do you want to know? I won't tell you. A dead person doesn't need to know the answer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the metahuman and two martial artists took action and suppressed Layla in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Layla was just a Class A- metahuman. She could control the water elemental. Her strength could operate to the extreme on the vast ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, she could not be a match for three strong men of the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They easily broke the huge waves she created, and their attacks were hard for her to resist. She would be seriously injured if she filed to avoid their attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Layla was in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, she was not far from the Alisa Ship. Jacob stayed on the ship and felt the familiar fluctuations of battle. Knowing that Layla had encountered the enemy, he rushed out immediately and joined the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them fought against the three men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob could control the earth elemental, and his strength was defense. His joining did not change much about the situation, and they could only barely remain undefeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to the three Class A- enemies, there were still nine Class B+ enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nine people could not participate in the battles between Class A- masters, but they could bypass them and attack the people on the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Board the ship and kill everyone!" After the metal-controlling metahuman ordered, the nine people immediately rushed towards the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob and Layla panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they could hardly protect themselves and could only hold on barely. How could they stop the nine people?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only watch the nine Class B+ metahumans rush into the mist and run towards the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, no!" Jacob and Layla's faces were pale. They knew that those people on the Alisa Ship were doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the strength of the escort team on the Alisa Ship, even with the addition of Ryan, Nathan, and Yulissa, they would definitely not be able to withstand the nine Class B+ metahumans' attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of them would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck you!" Layla and Jacob went crazy. "You dare to destroy the Augustine family! Even if we will die, we will seriously injure you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob and Layla were crazy, but due to the numerical disadvantage, they could never gain the upper hand and were entangled by the three men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time went by, their power was depleted more and more. If this continued...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would be exhausted and killed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're done!" Jacob and Layla despaired.</span></p><div class="pagination">
