  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes widened in surprise. "We've just scored big&mdash;each of us got three Element Gold Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would you want to leave Umbra Earth now? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't grasp their reasoning. They had finally found the Element Gold Crystals, so why were Avery and the others choosing to leave?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opportunities to enter Umbra Earth were few and far between.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, Avery spoke up, "It's because we've realized just how little we contribute to this team. We underestimated the dangers of Umbra Earth and overestimated our own capabilities. In fact, after our run-in with the Phantom Worms, we made the decision to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We couldn't even sense the presence of the Phantom Worms! No matter what we tried, we just couldn't pinpoint where they were. We were helpless, watching you and Osborne handle the fight on our behalf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that moment, we knew Umbra Earth was far too dangerous for us. The unique creatures here, like the Phantom Worms, are beyond our ability to handle. If it weren't for you and Osborne, we'd have made easy targets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of embarrassment colored Avery's cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "But we were so close to the Element Gold Crystals that we didn't want to leave empty-handed. In the end, we stuck around, shamelessly following you into this, just to partake in the distribution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I honestly feel that even without us, you and Osborne would've still claimed these Element Gold Crystals! If you hadn't intervened back in the mushroom forest, we would've been finished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's almost ironic; everyone else thinks that Osborne would be a burden to our team, but only we know the truth&mdash;we're the real burdens!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Avery fixed her grateful gaze on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda opened her mouth, seemingly preparing to argue, but words escaped her as Avery pressed on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Rivera, you don't need to try and convince us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're already grateful for what we've received. To walk away with three Element Gold Crystals is more than enough for us. We sincerely hope you and Osborne can find even more treasures and return safely to Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever happens, thank you for taking care of us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll be waiting in Elf City for your safe return, and if you ever need us, we'll do our best to help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Avery bowed deeply to both Alfreda and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfrey and Hermione quickly followed suit, each offering their own formal bows of respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly joined in, adding, "Avery speaks for both Cyrus and me as well! We honestly have no means to fight the Phantom Worms, and it's clear that we should leave immediately rather than hold you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued with a rueful smile, "I'm incredibly relieved I stepped away from Prince Desmond's team! Otherwise, my only purpose here would have been as cannon fodder, drawing the Phantom Worms' attention away from them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prior to this moment, she had been puzzled as to why the various Royal Families from Elf City were recruiting warriors from Racial Convergence Planet to explore Umbra Earth. It seemed obvious they were trying to share the spoils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Royal Families needed warriors from Racial Convergence Planet to act as decoys!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Phantom Worms posed a terrifying threat&mdash;not just due to their strength, but also because of their ability to remain undetected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from a few warriors like Alfreda, the rest found themselves completely blindsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when the Phantom Worms attacked, most couldn't even lock onto their location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this perilous scenario, the Elf Royal Families needed warriors like them to act as prey, drawing the Phantom Worms' focus away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we've made our decision to leave," Beverly said, her expression resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda scanned the faces of Avery, Godfrey, Hermione, Beverly, and Cyrus, noting their resolute expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, she relented. "Alright then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you all want to leave Umbra Earth, I won't try to change your minds. You're right; this place is incredibly dangerous. Even I struggle to detect the Phantom Worms before they strike. By the time they attack, I might not have time to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for Osborne, I could have easily fallen victim to one of their attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I completely understand your desire to get out of this perilous situation. You don't need to feel guilty about it. After all, life is far more important than any treasure we might find in Umbra Earth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, a smile broke across Alfreda's face. "Regardless, we've fought together, and that makes us both comrades and friends. I hope we'll cross paths again someday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, a wave of relief washed over the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda waved her hand. "Let's go! We've explored this branch of the chasm thoroughly, and it's time to head back to the main chasm to choose another branch to explore. We can all return together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seven of them began their journey back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they found themselves at the main chasm. Following the path ahead would lead them out of Umbra Earth and back to Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goodbye, Alfreda! Goodbye, Osborne!" they called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See you later!" Alfreda replied, watching as Avery and the others disappeared into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A twinge of melancholy tugged at her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their exploration team, once nine strong, had completely disbanded on the first day in Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All except for her and Osborne seemed too shaken by the dangers to stay any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Osborne, she said softly, "Osborne, I think they were all great people, but now it's just the two of us left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a gentle smile and nodded. "Don't be sad! Avery and the others made a smart choice by leaving Umbra Earth. It's for the best!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This place is genuinely perilous, and their strength isn't enough to deal with the Ghostwing Insects, let alone the deadly spores from the mushroom trees or the Phantom Worms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, who knows what other dangers lurk in Umbra Earth that could be even worse than the Phantom Worms? Their timely exit is a good thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's better than ending up dead here, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda considered his words and nodded, her mood lifting considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right! Their decision to leave this dangerous place is definitely for the best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you seem unfazed by the threats here. How did you manage to knock out Cyrus and Neville? And how did you even sense the Phantom Worms? Not to mention, you seemed completely unaffected by those deadly mushroom spores that drove even Ascension Five warriors like Cyrus and Neville into madness...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, you sensed the energy fluctuations of the Element Gold Crystals before I did. Wait a second... I'm starting to realize you have a lot of secrets, Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fixed him with an intense gaze. "So, tell me honestly, are you really just an Ascension One Supernal Deity King?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wouldn't be surprised if you were actually Ascension Six!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. "I really am Ascension One Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, enough with the questions! We only have a month to explore Umbra Earth, so let's not waste any more time. Let's dive into the next branch of the chasm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne casually picked a branch and stepped inside, ready for whatever lay ahead.</span></p><div class="pagination">
