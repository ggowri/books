  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Spirit Tracer of the Bowman family was an Ultimate device forged by the Artisan Institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once it locked onto a person's energy signature, it could pinpoint their general location. Unless someone was dead and their energy signature vanished, there was no escaping the Spirit Tracer's pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This process was somewhat similar to Kendra's unique power, though Kendra's abilities were even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Capturing someone's energy signature wasn't a simple feat; it usually required the person to either cooperate or for the hunter to possess overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra, on the other hand, could memorize a person's energy signature with just a single glance, regardless of their strength or willingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Spirit Tracers had a range limitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the most advanced models could only scan a radius of a few million miles. Once someone stepped outside that range, the Spirit Tracer would lose their trail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra's power, however, transcended those limits</span><span>. N</span><span>o matter where someone fled, she could find them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In summary, Kendra's power was superior, but the Ultimate Spirit Tracer was still incredibly effective for tracking those whose energy signatures had been recorded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Celestara, many members of the Human Community lived under oppression and exploitation, treated as slaves or laborers by various powerful factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They refrained from escaping because their energy signatures had long been recorded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they attempted to flee, these factions would use Spirit Tracers to bring them back, and the consequences of being recaptured were dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, most Human Community slaves and miners remained compliant, clinging to any shred of hope for survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One could say the Spirit Tracer served as a chain binding their hands and feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Bowman family guard began to scan the area rapidly with the Spirit Tracer, Hannah felt a wave of anxiety wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Osborne</span><span> and</span><span> remember</span><span>ed </span><span>how he had assured her earlier that the Eclipsing Mantra would completely conceal her energy signature from detection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Hannah couldn't shake her doubts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew just how formidable a premium Spirit Tracer could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if Osborne was mistaken? If so, her position would be exposed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Hannah saw Osborne's calm demeanor, she began to relax a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, the guard using the Spirit Tracer spoke up, "I've confirmed it! Hannah's energy signature has completely vanished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's truly dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah froze at those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Is it really possible? Did the premium Spirit Tracer not detect my energy signature?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart raced as Hannah looked back at Osborne, a mix of excitement and relief flooding her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that the Bowman family has taken revenge for Tobey, they won't target the Gellar family or pursue the Mystic Feather Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't drag them into this mess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah couldn't help but smile, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at her and said, "Hannah, don't get too comfortable just yet. Even if you're dead, that doesn't necessarily mean the Bowman family will leave the Gellar </span><span>family or the Mystic Feather Clan alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to keep an eye on things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah frowned, momentarily stunned. "That can't be true! This situation has nothing to do with the Gellar family or the Mystic Feather Clan! Now that they've avenged Tobey by 'killing' me, the Bowman family shouldn't want to continue with any further attacks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, choosing not to reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Aldrich, at the top of the palace, revealed a cold smirk. "</span><span>So</span><span> she's really dead? Hmph, what a bargain for her! I had planned to capture her alive and enjoy torturing her for killing my son Tobey!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred then chimed in, "Uncle Aldrich, if we've avenged Tobey, what's our next move? Should we head back to the Central Zone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich's expression hardened</span><span> and </span><span>a cold fury radiat</span><span>ed</span><span> from him. "Return? Absolutely not! Even though Hannah is dead and the killer of my son Tobey is gone, our business is far from finished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan have teamed up and sent us Celestial Crystals, requesting the Bowman family to take care of the Mystic Feather Clan. They want them eliminated or at least driven out of Wild Flame City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We accepted their Celestial Crystals, so we have to deliver on this deal! Right now, no one knows Hannah is dead except us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can use this as an opportunity to strike the Gellar family and crush the Mystic Feather Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those damned Mystic Feather Clan members who shelter the lowly Human Community have been a thorn in my side for too long. It's time we showed them just how wrong they are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with a murderous intent that sent shivers down the spines of those around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call the guards immediately! Contact the Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan and let them know to gather their top fighters. We'll surround the Mystic Feather Clan's floating mountain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are over a million of them in Wild Flame City, and I want them all dead! Let every last one of these Mystic Feather Clan members accompany my son Tobey to the grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Aldrich's aura darkened, emanating an almost palpable sense of violence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred grinned in agreement. "If that's the plan, let's wipe out the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City! I'm on the verge of breaking through to Deity King myself, so it's the perfect time to stretch my legs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a glint of bloodlust flashed in Alfred's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Hannah stood frozen</span><span> and</span><span> shock cours</span><span>ed</span><span> through her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
