  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Identical Shadow Drakes roared as they charged at one another, colliding with a thunderous crash.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow Drake against Shadow Drake, they erupted in a frenzy of roars, ultimately collapsing and exploding on impact.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwaves shot out in all directions, causing anyone thousands of miles away to change their expressions in alarm, unleashing their divine power to shield themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Sanctum of Night activated its black shield, blocking all residual energy from the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash intensified, so fierce that ordinary onlookers couldn't tell who had the upper hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, both Lord Malevolence and Isa were shrouded in thick darkness, with only the terrifying Shadow Drakes visible as they collided relentlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Endless and unyielding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the two were trying to outdo each other in a contest of dark power.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle raged on, showing no signs of ending anytime soon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, Zoe! Get up here!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's voice cut through the tension, reaching Anastasia and Zoe, who had been anxiously watching the fight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two looked up toward the Sanctum of Night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa is calling us&mdash;wait, she's the Goddess of Fate now..." Anastasia bit her lip, hesitating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop hesitating and come up!" Clarissa urged again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's pause, Anastasia nodded, gathering Zoe, Kendra, Mila, and Hannah as they shot up toward the Sanctum of Night, landing in front of Clarissa, Emma, and Austin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa greeted them with a bright smile, stepping forward. "I saw you earlier, but the battle was too intense to call you!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that Isa is fighting Lord Malevolence, their power is overwhelming. I worried the shockwaves might harm you, so it's safer for you to stay here in the Sanctum of Night."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Clarissa took Anastasia's hand warmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been over twenty years! You've all grown so much!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia felt her eyes welling up with tears at her words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, she asked, "Should I call you Goddess of Fate now, or can I still call you&mdash;Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice held a hint of worry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since she learned that Clarissa was the reincarnation of the Goddess of Fate, she had felt a bit panicked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Will Clarissa still be willing to be Osborne's woman now that she has regained her past memories?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's concern had kept her from speaking to Clarissa earlier. She was caught between hope and anxiety.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as Anastasia voiced her worries, a sense of relief washed over her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked deeply into Clarissa's eyes, waiting for a response.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing her question, Clarissa playfully tapped Anastasia's nose and smiled, "What nonsense! Of course, I'll be just like before! The Goddess of Fate is just a part of my past identity. Right now, I'm still Clarissa!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, don't forget they're also Osborne's women..." Clarissa added, pointing at Emma and Austin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two stepped forward, grinning. "Anastasia, you're Osborne's sister, which makes you our sister too! Don't worry about our past identities. Just because we've regained our memories doesn't mean we've changed."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you all still want to be with my brother? But you're the untouchable Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa laughed again. "True, we are the Seven Great Deity Kings, but we're not untouchable!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What worries us more is that your brother, that charming rogue, might be off chasing after someone else and leave us behind! So don't fret about it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was stunned by Clarissa's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having regained their past memories and transforming into one of the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community, Clarissa, Emma, and Austin hadn't changed one bit!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It feels so good!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia had truly worried that with their new identities, Clarissa and the others might look down on Osborne or deny their relationship with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If that were the case, how heartbroken would Osborne be?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, her worries were lifted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beaming, she exclaimed, "Clarissa! Emma! Austin! I hear my brother talk about you all the time. He... really, really misses you! The only thing holding us back is our lack of strength&mdash;we just can't come looking for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Clarissa, Emma, and Austin smiled warmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We know! We know everything!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three returned greetings to Mila, Kendra, and Hannah.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a more intense explosion echoed through the air, sending powerful shockwaves that made the Sanctum of Night tremble, causing the protective shield to ripple.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group's attention snapped back to the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's cold voice cut through the chaos. "Well, well! Impressive! Truly impressive!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night, you've trained an astonishing disciple! There used to be only one God of Night who could fight me like this on Celestara Planet, but now I have to contend with another!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we face off, I always have this strange sensation that it's the God of Night I'm battling. If I didn't know better, I'd almost think you were him in disguise!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent shockwaves through the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that he wasn't gaining the upper hand; </span><span>the power </span><span>Isa</span><span> ha</span><span>s demonstrated was terrifying, rivaling even that of the God of Night himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization ignited excitement among the Human Community members; hopes flared as they began to anticipate the possibility of Isa defeating Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Clarissa and the others weren't so optimistic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They watched Isa with concern, noticing her complexion had grown slightly paler.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prolonged battle was taking its toll on her, while Lord Malevolence appeared unfazed, as if he hadn't even broken a sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference might be subtle, but to Clarissa and her group, it was palpable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa finally spoke up, "Lord Malevolence, I didn't expect you've really reached Ascension Ten!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to hide it anymore; I can sense it! Are you saving your trump card for my teacher? Stop holding back! Go all out and defeat me if you want a chance to meet him!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy silence fell over the crowd as her words hung in the air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Expressions of shock blossomed across countless faces, including those of Clarissa and her companions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Ten?!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence has ascended to Ascension Ten?!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is serious!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face was etched with worry. "Isa is only at Ascension Nine! The gap in power between Ascension Nine and Ascension Ten is monumental! Isa is in big trouble!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all in trouble! The entire Human Community of Celestara Planet is in for a world of hurt!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
