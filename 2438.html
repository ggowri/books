  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's question, Drum tilted its head and looked at Osborne, staying silent for a long time. To it, this didn't seem like a question at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are my dad," Drum finally answered innocently. "I chose you, so you are my dad. Not even my mom can change that. Even if my mom stops me, persuades me, or asks me to choose a stronger dad, the moment I felt your presence, I already decided you were my dad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum's eyes were filled with seriousness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned, thinking, "You chose me, so I'm your dad? Is your dad decided by choice?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was really curious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum seemed to finally understand Osborne's meaning and replied, "Dad, my mom and I are both members of the Galactic Bug Clan. In the Galactic Bug Clan, dads are chosen by us. If the Galactic Bug Clan wants to grow, we must select a dad and absorb the power in his blood to get through our childhood, so we can grow up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My mom once chose an angel from the Spirit Clan as her dad. But unfortunately, her dad later betrayed her. Otherwise..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum's voice suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne suddenly felt anger emanating from Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This left Osborne utterly surprised, as if he had uncovered a huge secret.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Galactic Bug Clan?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum and Empress Kira are both members of the Galactic Bug Clan, and after birth, the Galactic Bug Clan must choose a "dad" and survive their childhood by feeding on the "dad's" blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empress Kira previously chose a warrior from the Angel Clan as her dad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that Angel Clan warrior ultimately betrayed Empress Kira. Could this be related to Empress Kira's defeat and the Bug Clan losing their rule over the cosmos?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, Osborne shook his head. Empress Kira's defeat back then felt too distant for him now. Even if he figured it out, it wouldn't matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kept staring at Drum, thinking, "As expected, the cosmos has all kinds of species. The Galactic Bug Clan can actually choose a dad and survive their childhood by absorbing their dad's blood. In that case, I really am Drum's 'dad,' since Drum has already chosen me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Drum wants to survive her childhood and grow up, she must absorb Osborne's blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking that Drum is Empress Kira's daughter, Osborne couldn't help but feel very excited, thinking, "Empress Kira is one of the strongest Masters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Empress Kira's daughter, how terrifying could Drum's talent and potential be? Drum is very weak now because she's still in her childhood. Once she gets through it, how terrifying will she become?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe she will be even stronger than Flash. Flash is an Astralwreck Dragon, one of the most talented and potential-filled species in the Beast Clan. But compared to Empress Kira's daughter, Flash is likely far inferior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, the Beast Clan has never ruled the cosmos, and there has never been a warrior in the Beast Clan on the same level as Empress Kira."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Drum, Osborne smiled and asked, "Drum, how long will it take for you to get through your childhood? You can drink my blood, but not too much. Otherwise, my body won't be able to handle it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum nodded firmly and said, "Dad, don't worry. I know. I won't hurt you. Also, after drinking your blood, I'll help you recover. My horn is amazing; it can purify your body and make you stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I only need to drink blood once a day. If you maintain your current strength, I&rsquo;ll probably need about ten thousand years to get through my childhood. By then, I&rsquo;ll be able to help you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Drum's words, Osborne was stunned, thinking, "Drum needs to drink blood once a day and will only get through childhood after ten thousand years?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly felt some pain in his neck. Doesn&rsquo;t this mean Drum will have to drink his blood over three million times to get through childhood?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, Drum said that this kind of blood-drinking wouldn&rsquo;t harm him but would actually benefit him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each time after drinking blood, Drum would use her horn to infuse Osborne's body with special power, helping to purify his body and make him stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a win-win situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But ten thousand years is too long.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum has no strength during her childhood. Osborne must quickly help Drum get through her childhood and enter maturity or adolescence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what, Drum is Empress Kira's daughter. Once she gets through her childhood, she will undoubtedly become incredibly powerful and Osborne's best ally.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he needs to help Drum get through her childhood as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked, "Drum, does my strength determine how fast you grow and how quickly you can get through your childhood?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum nodded vigorously. "Yes. Daddy, you're so smart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit awkward</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is she forcing a compliment on me?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, his guess was correct. If he wants Drum to get through her childhood quickly, the most direct way is to improve his own strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The higher his cultivation level, the better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is currently just an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King. Drum would need to drink his blood for ten thousand years to get through her childhood because the energy in his blood is too little to help Drum much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he breaks through to Empyrean Sacredness, the energy in his blood will increase tenfold or even a hundredfold. By then, Drum should only need a thousand years or a few hundred years to get through her childhood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A few hundred years is still a long time. It seems that in the short term, I can't make Drum quickly get through her childhood to help me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it. I won't think about this for now," Osborne said again, "Drum, your mom staying in my body won't be a problem, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum nodded and said, "Yes, Dad. My mom just can't bear to leave me and wants to stay with me, so she entered your body. If I get tired, I can still rest in my mom's arms."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, my mom can help you improve your strength while she's in your body. However, with your current strength, you can't feel the improvement. Dad, once your cultivation level gets higher, you'll understand."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, my mom said if we encounter danger, she will show up to protect us and drive away all the bad guys. My mom is really amazing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, to hatch me, my mom used up most of her strength. Now, she has to spend most of her time sleeping to recover her power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, under normal circumstances, we'd better not wake my mom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Drum's serious words, Osborne roughly understood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded and said, "Alright. If there's nothing urgent, I won't wake your mom. Drum, how about I take you away from here now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum nodded happily. "Sure! I can finally leave. But, Dad, can you take my pet with us too?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your pet?" Osborne was stunned and asked, "Drum, what is your pet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum proudly pointed to the group of Ice Beetles outside and said, "These are my pets. They're weak, but very obedient."</span></p><div class="pagination">
