  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but sit up straight, his heart filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Finally, it's coming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's only been two days since the release of the third heir's mission. Am I about to complete the task already?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What will Godfather reward me with for this achievement?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surely, there's a way to upgrade Satan's Eye to level four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cash rewards exceeding a billion are likely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, I was rewarded with a billion-dollar company; this time, it must be even grander, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in my Draco Star Wristlet's store, there must be even more unique items to purchase. Perhaps I can even get my hands on Class A individual equipment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna continued, "Osborne, I'm promoting you to be Clarissa's Deputy Head of Security, on par with Harris, Violet, and Sharon, the three other deputy heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, for your outstanding service, a bonus of 50 million awaits you. I hope you won't find it lacking. We don't want others to envy you, so the Radcliffe family will compensate you more in other ways."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Donna finished speaking, Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Deputy Head?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh? I thought Donna would directly promote me to the Head of Security. But it's just a deputy head?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's the use of being a deputy head?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Come on! I want to be the head!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is frustrating. I knew becoming Godfather's heir wouldn't be this easy. Luckily, I still have five days left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adjusting his emotions, Osborne asked, "Who will be the head in the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna smiled in response, "My son will be the head in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt even more frustrated, thinking, "If the next head is another trusted one of the Radcliffe family like Paul, I could find a way to push them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Donna is arranging for her son to be the head of the security team?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What can I do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Clarissa exclaimed with surprise, "Aunt Donna, Barlyn is back? It's not appropriate for Barlyn to be my head of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think Osborne should do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, filled with excitement, eagerly awaited Donna to change her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Donna shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing inappropriate about it. That little rascal should learn a lesson! He's your cousin and protecting you is his duty. After what happened with Paul, I can no longer trust the Radcliffe family's confidants. Only Barlyn, who has adored you since childhood, will surely protect you with all his heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa seemed like she wanted to say something more, but Donna waved her hand, making a firm decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's settled. Just trust me on this. With him around and Osborne as deputy head to assist him, I feel much more at ease."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne felt disappointed once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna changed the subject, saying, "I still have a question. How did Paul manage to avoid detection? Clarissa's ability to detect lies should have exposed Paul's betrayal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa furrowed her brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, my power isn't foolproof. Perhaps Paul had some special means."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna nodded, not pressing further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a thought struck Osborne, prompting him to reach into his pocket and pull out a cross necklace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there was anything peculiar about Paul, it undoubtedly revolved around this necklace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This necklace resembled the legendary ancient artifact, Cain's Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had read about Cain's Blood Cross in Godfather's intelligence files.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross possessed unimaginable magical powers, allowing its wielder to consume the blood of others to enhance their own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also rumored to have the ability to imprison souls, influence vampires, shield against supernatural powers, and store abilities - a mighty artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A century ago, the Blood Cross had appeared in Rosmandi, seemingly taken by The Aberrants, but there had been no news of it since then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Could this cross necklace be Cain's Blood Cross?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross is known to shield against meta-invasion. Is this why Paul could disregard Clarissa's meta-detection? When I used Satan's Eye to spy on Paul, it also triggered a red warning light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's highly likely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also, the Blood Cross can awaken vampire clans, the Blood Clan. Paul's transformation into a Blood Clan must be due to this artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this really is the Blood Cross, it's an ancient relic - priceless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it's genuine, then I've hit the jackpot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'd better keep the necklace safe for later investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, my focus has to be on figuring out how to become the head bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The new head bodyguard is Donna's son, Barlyn. It's clear Barlyn can't be a spy. So, what should I do to replace Barlyn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have to take things one step at a time. First, I need to meet Barlyn and assess the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If all else fails, I might have to resort to that measure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a plan forming in his mind, Osborne felt more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the convoy pulled up to the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, several helicopters hovered above the mansion, and a strikingly handsome young man, accompanied by a group of men and women, descended from the aircraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Barlyn!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
