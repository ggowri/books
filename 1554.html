  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fabian glared at Osborne, his eyes burning with rage and a thirst for vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just days ago, at the slave market, Osborne had snatched Betty and her sisters from him, showing him no respect whatsoever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fabian had thought that once Osborne left the market, he could easily take him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, Osborne had toyed with Fabian, using his speed to evade capture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The incident had become a source of mockery among the people of Wild Flame City. As a Deity Overlord warrior, it was humiliating that he couldn't handle a mere human who had just broken through to Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he was determined to restore his reputation by killing Osborne in front of a crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he hadn't anticipated was that the Spark Estate, now owned by Osborne, was protected by a high-quality divine power barrier. Even with the combined might of himself and Gilbert from the Keynes family, they couldn't breach it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not even hundreds of warriors above the Transcendent Deity level from both families could break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their only option was to wear down the barrier through attrition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fabian was convinced that Osborne's supply of Essence Crystals couldn't be infinite. Eventually, they would exhaust his resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, seeing Osborne emerge with Betty and her sisters, Fabian assumed it meant Osborne was out of Essence Crystals and had no choice but to come out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered at Osborne, saying, "So, you've finally crawled out of your little turtle shell, huh? Running low on Essence Crystals? I warned you, crossing me would lead to a bad end! Beg for mercy now, and hand over those three women to me. Maybe I'll let you die quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gilbert chimed in with a cold laugh, "Yeah! You'd better beg for mercy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You dare cripple my family's Kerwin and take out four of my Celestial Deity warriors? You deserve nothing less than death! Today, no one can save you! If you surrender and hand over this estate, I might make your death a little less painful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes gleamed with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at their threats. "Oh? So you both want me to beg for mercy? One wants the girls, and the other wants my estate? You really are quite demanding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think you're worthy of such a deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His mocking words ignited fury in Fabian and Gilbert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lowly human, you're still cocky even when death is staring you in the face? You must be out of your mind! If you don't beg for mercy, we'll make you do it! Once we kill you, everything you own will still belong to us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a shared glance, they prepared to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly, "Hold on! Why rush into things?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wouldn't you like to live a little longer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fabian scoffed, saying, "What's this? Have you come to your senses? Want to prolong your life? Then beg us! There are plenty of folks from Wild Flame City watching; if you beg nicely and hand over those three slave girls and your estate, we promise not to torture you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly!" Gilbert echoed, his voice dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced toward the distance, spotting numerous members of various factions from Wild Flame City watching the unfolding drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze landed on Calvin from the Swift family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Calvin caught Osborne's eye, he sneered, filled with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne merely smiled in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think you've misunderstood me! What I meant was that if you don't rush into attacking, you might just live a little longer. But if you're eager to die, then by all means, go ahead and attack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne shrugged nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fabian and Gilbert erupted into laughter, their voices echoing in the tense air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look at you, pathetic human! You really have lost it!" Fabian sneered. "You think you can kill us? Ha! Who do you think you are? I could stand here all day, and you wouldn't be able to touch me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gilbert joined in, his voice dripping with mockery. "You managed to escape Fabian a few days ago with your speed, but today? You're out of luck! In front of me, your little tricks won't work at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you're asking for death, let's make it happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a shared glance, the two sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gilbert moved with terrifying speed, appearing behind Osborne and the sisters in the blink of an eye, cutting off their path back to the Spark Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Fabian stepped in front of Osborne, a cruel smile plastered on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now you can't hide in your cozy little estate anymore! You're finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they advanced, a massive wave of Deity Overlord energy surged around them, enveloping Osborne, Betty, and her sisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sheer force left the girls pale and terrified, their eyes wide with fear as they looked to Osborne for reassurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to their surprise, he wore a calm smile, unfazed by the looming threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "Since you're so eager to meet your end, I'll gladly oblige; and as for you, the Wolfe family and the Keynes family, daring to attack Spark of Blaze? You'll face the consequences of your actions! Darren, it's time to strike!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
