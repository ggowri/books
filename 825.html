  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, I'll teach you," Isa said with a soft smile. "But first, let me kiss you deeply."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she wrapped her arms around Osborne's neck.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, Osborne pressed his lips to hers, and his hands roamed freely over her body.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He caressed her breasts, squeezing them gently, and moved to her perky peaks, giving them a playful slap. Finally, he sought to explore her crotch.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the next instant, Isa kicked him away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ouch!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne clutched his chest, staring at Isa in shock. He felt a sharp force pierce through him like a needle, exploding within his body.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The blast threatened to shatter his very being.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa, that was harsh, don't you think?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rubbed his chest. "If you didn't want me to touch you, you could've just said so. There was no need for such violence. You could've killed me, and then you'd be a widow."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's smile remained enigmatic. "Who told you to touch me so freely? You're getting bolder by the day. When I hit you, I didn't use any real strength, just a little bit of power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How do you feel?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was dumbfounded. "Just a little bit of power? How could such a small amount cause me so much harm? I almost suffered serious injuries."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's smile didn't waver. "This is what I want to teach you. It's called Explosive Force!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Explosive Force?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was surprised.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't you want to know why your full-force attacks barely scratch an S-class opponent like Marvin, yet I can defeat him with ease at the same strength level?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I use Explosive Force!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes widened. "What is Explosive Force?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's simple. Explosive Force is making your power burst out suddenly! Let me ask you, why not try using Point Blank Force against Marvin after your attack hardly pierce through his defenses? You've honed your Point Blank Force to perfection, haven't you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sighed with a bitter smile, "True, I've mastered it, but it's useless against Marvin. While it can penetrate his defenses, the damage is minimal. It's pointless to poke a tiny hole in his body."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's smile deepened. "What if your Point Blank Force could explode inside his body after piercing his defenses?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was speechless.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that Explosive Force?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly. That's Explosive Force! The reason I can defeat Marvin so easily is that I first pierce his defenses with Point Blank Force and detonate Explosive Force within him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's like throwing a bomb inside his body. Even an S-class warrior with a robust physique can't withstand such an attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Explosive Force must be used in conjunction with Point Blank Force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, you can also combine it with Deadly Force, but that's more complex. You can explore that on your own later.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, I'll teach you how to use Explosive Force."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa began her instruction, and Osborne listened intently.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mastering the sudden surge of power might seem straightforward in theory, but when Osborne endeavored to harness it himself, he discovered it was anything but effortless.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mastering Explosive Force proved far more challenging than Deadly Force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To tame Explosive Force, his command over his strength had to ascend to an exacting, almost tyrannical level. He toiled relentlessly through the day, yet not once did he taste success.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This realization shook Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his current level of insight and Isa's guidance, he had spent a whole day without even getting the basics down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne finally understood why Isa hadn't taught him Explosive Force earlier.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He simply wasn't strong enough to learn it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I must succeed!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gritted his teeth. First, he contacted the Augustine family to assure them of his safety. Then, he prepared to enter seclusion right there, determined not to return until he had mastered Explosive Force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During his rest periods, he activated the death power gifted to him by Emma, transforming his brain and enhancing his comprehension.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under these conditions, his control over power improved at a remarkable rate.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time flew by.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, a week had passed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In addition to practicing Explosive Force, Osborne absorbed the star power to bolster his strength. After seven days of training, he felt not only unfatigued but invigorated.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And on that day, he finally succeeded in using Explosive Force for the first time.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He kicked a massive tree, seemingly without effort. Employing Point Blank Force, he pierced the trunk before detonating with a sudden burst of power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A thunderous explosion shattered the silence. The massive tree, so wide it would take five people to encircle it with their arms, burst into a storm of splinters. Wood chips scattered wildly in every direction.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stood in awe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did I do that?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've finally succeeded! I've mastered Explosive Force!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rushed to Isa, embracing her tightly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa, I've done it! I've mastered Explosive Force!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At the Honor Quest Ceremony in half a month, I will definitely defeat you!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just you wait and see how I'll handle you!"</p><div class="pagination">
