  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain explained, "The hierarchy of deities is quite extensive, stretching from Junior Deity all the way up to Deity King, with a total of seven distinct levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The progression goes like this: Junior Deity, Intermediate Deity, Superior Deity, Transcendent Deity, Celestial Deity, Deity Overlord, and finally, the pinnacle of Celestara's warriors&mdash;the Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each level is vastly different from the one before it. Even the most gifted individuals find it incredibly challenging to leap across these boundaries and defeat an opponent of a higher rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless, of course, you've got an Ultimate divine artifact on your side!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you manage to get your hands on a Cosmic Treasure, well, that changes the game entirely. Back when I first broke through to Deity Overlord, the God of Night was already at the peak of Deity King. If I'd also been a Deity King, with Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity back then, I might not have had to fear him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's expression was a mixture of pride and indignation, as if he were still grappling with the weight of his past failures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne listened, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Seven levels of deities? That's staggering! The gap between Junior Deity and Deity King must be wider than the chasm between an ordinary person and a Class S fighter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brow furrowed in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, I'm not even a Junior Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, with my current strength, I could probably hold my own against a Junior Deity, but an Intermediate Deity? I'd be toast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's just no way I'd stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once you ascend to the divine realm, the differences in power become monumental. </span><span>An Intermediate Deity could easily wipe the floor with a Junior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I clearly can't do that yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mentally counted the ranks: Junior Deity, Intermediate Deity, Superior Deity, Transcendent Deity, Celestial Deity, Deity Overlord, and Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of Lord Malevolence invading Celestara and effortlessly slaughtering over ninety percent of the deities sent a chill down his spine. Ultimately, it took the combined strength of seven Deity Kings to bring him down, and even then, he managed to stay alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that Lord Malevolence has surpassed the Deity King level? If so, what kind of realm does that put him in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had mentioned that as the world underwent its changes, Lord Malevolence's Dark Deities would gradually regain their power. Even he would come back stronger than before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of facing such a formidable foe sent waves of anxiety through Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with Isa being the God of Night's disciple, she would inevitably have to confront Lord Malevolence herself. It was clear that her urgency for Osborne to grow stronger was tied to the looming threat he posed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the weight of his situation pressed down on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seven levels of deities loomed above him like a mountain, and if he ever hoped to help Isa take on Lord Malevolence, he would need to reach at least the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deity King..." Osborne murmured, a mix of awe and doubt swirling in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of practitioners in the Age of Gods far surpassed anything he could fathom&mdash;thousands if not millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, how many would actually ascend to the rank of Deity King?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only name seven so far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one was a rare gem, a one-in-a-billion find. No matter how much confidence Osborne had in himself, the thought of becoming a Deity King felt like an insurmountable mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there were the Deity Kings themselves, beings of immense power who had spent countless years honing their skills to reach that pinnacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no idea how much time was left on the clock, but he knew it was quickly ticking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "No wonder Isa always says I'm moving too slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to think the strongest people in the world were just the top Class S fighters. Now I see how wrong I was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top Class S fighters are nothing but ants compared to the likes of a Junior Deity! Any Junior Deity could wipe out a whole squad of Class S fighters without breaking a sweat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And above Junior Deity, there are still seven more levels to climb before reaching Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, his face set in determination, his eyes burning with an insatiable thirst for power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze hardened with resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to grow stronger, fast! Isa is counting on me to help her! I must level up as quickly as possible! Step one? Become a god! A Junior Deity, to be precise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His short-term goal&mdash;Junior Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His long-term goal&mdash;Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made up his mind and continued to control his power, guiding the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity into his body. This Cosmic Treasure was something even Deity King warriors might covet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, once I fuse it, I'll achieve immortality!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, I might be able to push myself harder for faster growth&mdash;can't die, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's anticipation grew, but he wasn't quite there yet. He wasn't a Junior Deity and didn't have a Divine Body. According to Cain, he could only temporarily transplant the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity into his body; complete fusion was out of the question due to its overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To withstand the fusion of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, a regular Divine Body would crumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bare minimum? A Level Three Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Level Three Divine Body&mdash;shouldn't be too tough!" Osborne considered, determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity hovered before him, beginning to integrate into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it appeared as a plant, it was far from an ordinary one. It lacked a physical form, existing as a highly condensed energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon contact with Osborne, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity slipped through his pores and merged seamlessly with his essence.</span></p><div class="pagination">
