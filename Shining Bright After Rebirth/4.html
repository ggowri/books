        <h1>Chapter 4 Disown</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Holy crap! We all pointed fingers at Diana, but it's all made up! Ms. Marsh cooked up this whole thing herself."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's messed up! Going to all that trouble just to get rid of Diana and steal her man."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The guests were buzzing with gossip.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was also stunned, he turned to find Diana's aloof face. She was the one got framed but she looked like she didn&rsquo;t care. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She seemed to have changed and became indifferent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was horrified. The electronic screen should have shown&nbsp;her classic dance scenes. But now it broadcast the evidence of her plotting against Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No! This is not true. This is not me! Diana, why did you frame me? You are leaving already, why are you framing me?!" Queenie spoke first&nbsp;and cried out like she was in pain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled pathetically, "Even if I framed you, those people who love you and stand by you still believe you, don't they? Even if you say you killed someone, they would not believe that and would defend you without hesitation."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie lowered her eyes, still unable to believe that her plotting would be known to others.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven also stood up to speak for Queenie. "Diana, don't talk nonsense.&nbsp;Queenie is so kind. She would not do that. Did you frame her?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well..." &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana let out a bitter laugh, tears in her eyes as she looked at the man in front of her. Every time, he chose to stand by Queenie instead of her. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, I've been with you for two years. Do you really see me as that terrible? Fine. You love Queenie so much that you even think her worst traits are perfect, not to mention her words. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The proof is right here, and you still won't believe it. What can I say to make you trust me?" &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was at a loss for words. "You..." &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked into her beautiful eyes, filled with grief, heartbreak, and sorrow, as if marrying him was a burden. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She stood alone, surrounded by the fresh garden air and the glow of a distant screen, seeming apart from the world. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The breeze gently played with her skirt and hair, while her striking eyes showed a cold determination. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven suddenly realized she had changed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were too many emotions in her deep and beautiful eyes that he couldn't understand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered, "Steven, the facts are right in front of you, but you are reluctant to believe me for even once." Her heart was filled with sadness, and every word was heartbreaking.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven couldn't suppress the pain in his heart.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, the police came in with two men.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The guests were even more gloating when witnessing this.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Capitole, the Gellar family and the Marsh family were always topics of discussion.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two men brought in by the police pointed at the shocked maid&nbsp;Megan not far away and said, "That old woman bribed me, and she gave me the money. Sir, I have evidence."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Police approached Megan, causing her blood pressure to spike due to the video leak. She knelt on the ground tremblingly and said, "Sir, I did everything. It has nothing to do with Ms. Marsh. Just arrest me. I did this on my own!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at Megan, who was crying, and felt a little suspicious that she was even willing to take on all the responsibilities, just to protect Queenie?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana wanted to leave with a clear conscience, so she created such a drama to expose Queenie's secret, but maybe she had more secrets.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana pretended to be incredulous and asked, "Megan, I have never offended you. Why did you frame me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Megan was stunned. Looking at Diana's beautiful face, she found Diana seemed a little different.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, just blame yourself for your bad luck. I did this because I don't like you. Your husband doesn't love you, and your brothers hate you too. I just didn't want this family to be in turmoil because of you, so I did this. You are such a curse!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled bitterly. It turned out that even a servant disliked her. How miserable her life was...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had died for an unworthy bastard.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But from now on, she would live a good life and would not give anyone the chance to hurt her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She should go back to the ones who really loved her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In her previous life, she let too many people down. And this time, she would not let down those who loved her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Marsh family would be in chaos, and she would just watch quietly from the side.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana realized what an idiot she used to be.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, she could start over again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at the policeman and smiled, "Sir, my lawyer will contact you about the progress of the case. He&nbsp;will go to the police station later."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana then looked at Paula Marsh, her mother. She walked over and whispered in Paula's ear, "Mrs. Marsh, you've pushed your own daughter away for the sake of your husband's bastard daughter with his mistress. We will wait and see what happens in the future."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana dropped the astonishing news and left in proud strides.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was not an adopted daughter but the daughter of Jeff's mistress.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff had exchanged the babies because he wanted to raise the daughter of his true love.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula watched Diana walk away, stunned and shocked, her eyes widening. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at her slim figure as she left, but she didn't even glance back at him. He then looked at Queenie.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie also looked at him nervously. "Steven, I don't know, I don't know anything." Megan had taken all the blame, so it was fine to play innocent as long as Diana knew nothing about it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked at Steven walking towards her. Her eyes went dark, and she fainted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie!" Steven nervously carried Queenie out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After walking out of the villa gate, he saw Diana, with a proud back, getting into a luxury car. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had the urge to chase after her, but the vehicle soon drove past him and disappeared into a cloud of dust.</p></div>
