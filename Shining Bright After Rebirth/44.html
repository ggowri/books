        <h1>Chapter 44 Translation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt a wave of disgust at the thought. "Mr. Powell, Steven and I signed the divorce papers months ago, but we haven't finalized it yet." She had considered filing for divorce herself after Steven's affair with Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's curiosity was piqued. "They haven't completed the process yet?" he wondered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, if you need any assistance, just let me know. We have excellent lawyers at our firm," Alexander offered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not necessary. I didn&rsquo;t receive any assets to begin with. As long as Steven agrees to go to the courthouse and finalize the divorce, it&rsquo;ll be straightforward," Diana replied. She preferred to keep things simple and avoid unnecessary complications.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. But if you need anything, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask. And thank you for your help tonight!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana appreciated the offer, thinking, "Maybe having a powerful ally isn't such a bad thing." She smiled warmly. "Mr. Powell, don't mention it. We&rsquo;re friends, and friends help each other."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, lowering his head gracefully to continue his dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Diana declined Alexander's offer to drive her home. She contacted Luna and waited by the roadside for her to pick her up. Despite it being ten o'clock at night, the streets were still bustling with pedestrians. Diana smiled brightly, enjoying the beautiful night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on her past, she thought, "Why was I so foolish before? I isolated myself in a luxurious villa, waiting for a man who would never return my love. I was the biggest fool for longing for something that wasn&rsquo;t there."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana," a low voice called from nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Diana turned and recognized the familiar voice. It was Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood at a distance, framed by the lights of a magnificent building, looking tall and imposing. Diana raised an eyebrow, wondering why he kept following her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, come home with me. We&rsquo;re not divorced yet," Steven said, approaching her. "And now you're flirting with other men before the divorce is final. Are you trying to cheat on me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity. "Steven, how dare you accuse me of that? You chose Queenie, so why did you marry me in the first place?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you had told me that you loved Queenie, I would have refused you without a second thought. You married me, but you never valued me. Later, I realized you only married me because your grandfather forced you to. He wanted you to settle down and have a family before granting you the inheritance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even then, you can&rsquo;t treat me like a plaything. When the Marsh family bullied me, you joined them, and you&rsquo;ve filed for divorce repeatedly. I signed the papers, so what more do you want?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And yet, you and Queenie are always together. Why don't you call that cheating?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her, his silence filled with unspoken thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana continued, "Steven, you and the Marsh family are heartless. Queenie did all those awful things, and you turned a blind eye, making me the scapegoat. Do you think I wasn't hurt because I didn't fight back? No, I was heartbroken. My own family, my brother, and my husband constantly bullied, suppressed, and humiliated me for someone like her. It was painful every time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Steven, whether you agree to the divorce or not, I won't ever love you again. If you refuse to divorce, Queenie will remain a mistress. Is that what you want?"</span></p></div>
