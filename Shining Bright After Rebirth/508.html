        <h1>Chapter 508 Keep Queenie and Steven in Check</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was taken aback by his words. Steven had never spoken to her like that in all these years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears of anger welled up. "Steven, how could you say that to me? I heard from Frank that she didn't save him. She had 50 million dollars for land but wouldn't spare 1 million dollars for my brother. If not for you, Eric would've been in trouble. She's heartless and malicious. Don't let her deceive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sneered, "Malicious? Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was left bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hurried after him. "The Farley family is offering the land in the western suburbs. Haven't you always wanted it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven thought of Diana's words, and his desire for that land vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, if it's land you're after, I can help you out." Diana's cold voice suddenly emerged behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie turned, facing Diana in the chilly wind. A faint, somewhat malicious smile graced her delicate features. The mention of land piqued her interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked with a smile, "Diana, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pondered, "Was Diana being nice because she wanted to return to the Marsh Villa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had always yearned for the warmth of family, a vulnerability Queenie had cunningly taken advantage of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past two years, each time Queenie caught a glimpse of Diana discreetly wiping away tears, it brought Queenie a peculiar sense of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana would always fall to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, Diana approached them. Seeing Queenie's tears, she glanced at Steven and said, "Mr. Gellar, what did you do to make your beloved cry? She looks utterly pitiful. It's enough to break one's heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, looking at her. "Why are you here? You should be resting after getting hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's reply was a poignant silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a derisive sneer, taunting, "I'm not like Queenie. I don't need to be rushed to the hospital for a scratch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there, watching Diana indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her eyes met Queenie's with a mischievous glint. "Queenie, if you manage to buy that plot of land, I'll consider forgiving Samuel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Playing tricks on Queenie was her favorite pastime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie frowned. "But Steven wants the land in the western suburbs. Diana, if you let Samuel go, could you give the land to Steven for free?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie couldn't help but wonder, "What exactly was Diana scheming now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She actually intended to hand it over to me without charge. There must be some vile reason for her to be this generous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie eyed Diana warily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's recent behavior made her cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you close with Samuel?" Diana asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her injured arm gave a slight throb. She had just wrapped up work and felt like taking a stroll, and then, out of nowhere, she ran into these two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Queenie's words, she became certain that Steven had his heart set on acquiring that land in the western suburbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not close. Diana, I'm doing this for Steven's sake," Queenie explained with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For his sake? But he's a cheater. Why should I help him? Mr. Wyatt Farley can't decide about the land; it's up to Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wyatt Farley offered it for free, trying to trick me. If you want it, I can ask Cecil to sell it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sensed Steven had discovered something about Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It explained his odd behavior recently and why he dragged his feet on the divorce. Diana needed to keep Queenie and Steven in check for a smooth divorce and a free life.</span></p></div>
