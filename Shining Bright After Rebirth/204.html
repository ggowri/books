        <h1>Chapter 204 I'll Play Until the End</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie saw that Steven was still there, so she put on a pitiful expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, how can you talk like that? Every time you hurt me before, I begged everyone to let you go..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" Diana interrupted coldly. "You're so kind, Queenie. Every time you asked people to forgive me, you'd also repeat how I framed you, fueling their hatred against me. You made sure everyone disliked me while adoring you alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't believe I spent so many years competing with a clown like you. Later, I realized everyone around you is not only blind but also wicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, no matter how kind I am, I will always be trampled by people like you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And you did it. You played everyone like fools, made everyone hate me. Isn't this exactly what you wanted?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Marsh family already hates me and has cut ties with me. I even gave you back the man you wanted, yet you keep pushing my limits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, I'm someone who's already died once. I have nothing left to fear. If you want to play, I'll play until the end."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana exuded a chilling aura, giving her a meaningful smile. Her head was slightly raised, exuding pride without arrogance, confidence without conceit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Queenie suddenly realized something. Standing before her was Diana, truly someone with decisive power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt like a mere speck of dust in comparison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was now someone to be admired, even revered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's lips parted slightly in shock. This version of Diana was simply too dazzling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Steven, his handsome face icy, his whole demeanor radiating a distant indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her heart trembled a bit. Tonight's events had pushed Steven even further away. She tried, "Steven, say something, will you? Diana's clearly bullying me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's cold eyes fixed on her. "Queenie, you're overacting. It's disgusting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes were wide with shock, tears slipping down her face. "Steven, even you... I didn't do anything wrong, I was just concerned about Diana..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven glanced at Diana and then turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned slightly, sensing that Steven had turned back into his cold self.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was happening?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, let's go home," Cecil said, casting a wicked smile at Queenie. "Ms. Marsh, let's play slowly, shall we?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He raised his middle finger, offering her a taunting smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie squinted at him, a hint of murderous intent in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That idiot Cecil couldn't beat her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had already stumbled at her hands, yet he dared to provoke her again. It seemed the lesson she taught him wasn't enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, what do we do now? Paula saw everything," Jeff said anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula was a woman of her word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie shot him a cold look. "Where's my mom?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told her to run away during the chaos," Jeff replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie gritted her teeth in anger, her face full of hatred. "What's wrong with you? Why were you with my mom? Wasn't Diana supposed to be there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hissed under her breath, unable to figure out where things had gone wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... I just saw your mother, and once inside, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was too embarrassed to continue, his face turning bright red.</p></div>
