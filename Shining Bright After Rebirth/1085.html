        <h1>Chapter 1085 Paternity Test</h1>
        <div><p>Diana found him utterly unreasonable, but on second thought, she understood this man who had lacked love since childhood.</p><p>He wandered overseas for years, not even daring to show his true face, with everything arranged by his father.</p><p>His life was like a puppet, controlled by others.</p><p>Although he couldn&#x27;t choose his birth, he could at least choose how to live.</p><p>Why did he naively think that replacing someone would let him possess everything they had?</p><p>At the end of the day, he was too cowardly at heart.</p><p>His fate was controlled by others. For that elusive illusion, he struggled in vain his whole life.</p><p>Diana&#x27;s gaze was cold as she said, &quot;How could you have such an absurd idea? You&#x27;re not my husband, so why should I love you wholeheartedly?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We look alike, and we share a similar temperament. You were once willing to give everything for Steven, but why are you so cold to me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Diana, do you know how jealous I am of Steven? Why can&#x27;t you love me just once like you loved him?&quot;</p><p>He became broken, desperate, and helpless.</p><p>From a young age, the obsession instilled by his father had taken root deeply—if he mimicked Steven&#x27;s every move, everything Steven had would eventually be his.</p><p>When he heard that Diana risked her life to save Steven from the fire, he was completely stunned.</p><p>Would Diana really risk everything for someone who doesn&#x27;t love her?</p><p>Diana felt a bit scared by his eerie gaze and didn&#x27;t know how to respond.</p><p>Doesn&#x27;t he deeply love Queenie?</p><p>How could he...</p><p>Steven pulled Diana into his arms, firmly declaring their relationship.</p><p>&quot;What right do you have to make my wife fall in love with you?&quot; Steven&#x27;s cold tone carried an undeniable sense of oppression.</p><p>Steven&#x27;s words completely ignited the anger in George&#x27;s heart.</p><p>&quot;Steven! Why? You had such a miserable childhood, so why do you still get to meet an angel like Diana?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She risked everything for you, saved you from the exploding car, but how did you treat her? You emotionally cheated with Queenie and ordered Diana around like a maid. Do you really deserve Diana&#x27;s love?&quot;</p><p>&quot;In contrast, why is it that I ended up with a selfish woman like Queenie?&quot;</p><p>These words left Diana and Steven stunned.</p><p>Watching the surveillance footage, Queenie in the office suddenly felt utterly foolish. She finally understood why George took his own life in front of Diana&#x27;s tombstone in their past life. It turned out he had always loved Diana.</p><p>Diana&#x27;s death left him in unbearable pain.</p><p>But in his memory, George&#x27;s understanding of Diana all came from her descriptions.</p><p>At this moment, Queenie suddenly realized. George had never met a woman in this life who loved Steven so selflessly like Diana.</p><p>Equally starved of love, he envied Steven, who was also abused by his father, but at least had Diana protecting him with her life.</p><p>However, he was all alone.</p><p>No one loved him, no one truly cared for him.</p><p>Even the woman who claimed to love him was just a vampire trying to climb into high society by stepping on his shoulders.</p><p>&quot;Hahaha...&quot; Queenie suddenly burst into wild laughter, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>If the truth is so, then why were they given a second chance at life?</p><p>Are they meant to torment each other?</p><p>What&#x27;s the point of such a life?</p><p>Seeing this, Mario stepped forward, hugged her from behind, and gently comforted her, &quot;Queenie, don&#x27;t be sad. You still have me.&quot;</p><p>Mario&#x27;s gentle voice abruptly stopped Queenie&#x27;s laughter. She leaned against his chest, gently caressing his cheek with her fingertips, tears in her eyes. &quot;Mario, only you are sincere to me.&quot;</p><p>Mario lowered his head and kissed her ear, thinking, &quot;George is finished, Queenie will eventually be mine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;My love for you won&#x27;t be less than anyone else&#x27;s.&quot;</p><p>Queenie knew that the only one who would stay with her until the end was him.</p><p>&quot;I know. Mario, go and tally George&#x27;s inheritance. It&#x27;s all mine now.&quot;</p><p>Mario boldly bit her earlobe and said in a husky voice, &quot;Alright, I&#x27;ll handle it after watching this livestream with you.&quot;</p><p>George and Charlie are doomed, the crimes of this father and son are even more heinous.</p><p>At the scene, experts are announcing the paternity test results.</p><p>&quot;After multiple verifications, Charlie and George are confirmed to be father and son, and George has no blood relation to Mr. Andrew.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well...&quot; George sneered, &quot;What&#x27;s the point of this proof? Are you trying to prove we are villains and they are saints?&quot;</p><p>Andrew responded coldly, &quot;You&#x27;re right. We are here to expose your crimes over the years.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now that we have returned safely, your schemes will be exposed. Go atone for your sins to those who died unjustly.&quot;</p><p>Charlie looked at his son with guilt and said, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry.&quot;</p><p>George laughed and cried, unable to understand why Charlie was apologizing.</p><p>Charlie had high hopes for him, and he felt that Charlie was disappointed.</p><p>&quot;Dad, I&#x27;m the one who should apologize. You&#x27;ve lived your whole life for me, and you even went as far as pretending to be someone else&#x27;s son.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You didn&#x27;t let me down. You&#x27;ve done so much for me. If anyone should apologize, it&#x27;s me. You paved the way for me, took everything for me, but in the end, I still couldn&#x27;t hold on to anything.&quot;</p><p>His eyes were filled with tears. &quot;If something isn&#x27;t yours, you can&#x27;t take it even by force.&quot;</p><p>Charlie&#x27;s eyes welled up with tears, &quot;But I still stole twenty years of Andrew&#x27;s life.&quot;</p><p>Over the past years, he enjoyed a life of luxury and wealth.</p><p>They just wanted to live with dignity, to stand openly under the sunlight. Is that wrong?</p><p>&quot;Andrew, the situation we&#x27;re in today, you and your uncle cannot escape blame. If you were just ordinary people, how could so many grudges have been involved?&quot;</p><p>&quot;And if you hadn&#x27;t been in that car accident back then, your son wouldn&#x27;t have grown up living in the shadow of it. Andrew, this is all because the Gellar family genes are too good. Your uncle is a genius, but you just can&#x27;t compare to him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ha ha...&quot; He laughed hysterically.</p><p>Everyone felt speechless after hearing that.</p><p>No matter what they face, who they choose to become is ultimately their own decision.</p><p>Charlie put all the blame on the Gellar family.</p><p>If it weren&#x27;t for the outstanding Gellar family genes, how could they have ended up like this?</p><p>He was forced into this world back then, and even his son couldn&#x27;t escape this fate.</p><p>He was innocent too. Why must they die?</p><p>He was unwilling. Everything was already in his grasp, so why did he still fail?</p><p>Andrew sneered, &quot;Charlie, what you seize is ultimately an illusion. What you should do is not plunder, but live your own life.&quot;</p></div>
