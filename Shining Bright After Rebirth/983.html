        <h1>Chapter 983 Paula Outsmarts Queenie</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie leaned forward on the seat in front of her, her frustration nearly unbearable. She buried her face in her hands, sobbing uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario glanced back at her, his heart aching at the sight of her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was Queenie's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, someone she had molded into who he was today. Once just an ordinary college student, he now earned millions of dollars annually, all thanks to her. He knew he owed everything to Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever he faced difficulties, she was the one who helped him through. To him, Queenie was not just a mentor. She was his family, even more than that, someone he deeply admired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Marsh, are you alright?" he asked gently, his voice filled with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing his voice, Queenie quickly stifled her sobs. She lifted her head, her tear-streaked face brimming with vulnerability. Mario's heart skipped a beat. At that moment, she looked heartbreakingly beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's mind wandered to her dreams. In them, Mario had been her steadfast companion, the one who stayed by her side through everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was loyal and devoted. Someone who never gave up on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shook her head, forcing a small smile. "I'm fine, Mario. It's good to have you here with me. Let's go see Paula."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She never imagined that Paula, who had doted on her for over twenty years, would become the blade stabbing her in the back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula had easily evaded her traps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie couldn't believe she had lost to Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She dialed Paula's number, and to her surprise, Paula answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello? Paula, let's meet," Queenie said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's voice was calm. "Alright. Come to the Elara Club. I'll wait for you there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine," Queenie replied, hanging up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula already knew why Queenie wanted to meet her. She arrived early at the Elara Club and prepared everything in advance. A cold smile played on her lips. "Queenie," she thought to herself, "you'll love the gift I've prepared for you. I've been planning this day for nearly a year. Today, I'll expose your true colors to the entire world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had cost Paula her daughter. Now, Paula was determined to make Queenie lose everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She glanced at the camera set up nearby and smiled. "Diana," she whispered, "today, I'll make you my true daughter, not just an adopted one, but my real flesh and blood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula couldn't believe how stupid she'd been in the past. She had once scorned her biological daughter, dismissing her as an unsophisticated bumpkin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But not anymore. Today was the premiere of Queenie's film.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Paula was going to ensure Queenie was erased from the entertainment industry for good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A knock on the door pulled Paula from her thoughts. She stood up and opened it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario was pushing Queenie's wheelchair, ready to enter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula stepped in front of him, blocking the way. "What are you doing, Ms. Barnes?" Mario asked, his voice tight with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't come in," Paula said coldly. "Wait outside. Don't worry, I won't harm her. This is a civilized society, and unlike her, I have morals."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario's eyes narrowed with fury. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's fine, Mario," Queenie interrupted. "Wait for me outside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Reluctantly, Mario let go of the wheelchair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula waved her hand, signaling two bodyguards nearby to approach, though Mario didn't notice them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once Paula and Queenie were inside, the door closed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bodyguards ensured Mario couldn't interfere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula wheeled Queenie to the sofa and took a seat across from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's face was directly in front of a hidden live-stream camera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unaware of the camera, Queenie didn't suspect anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fueled by her anger, she glared at Paula and shouted, "Paula, you're disgusting! How dare you scheme against me? You've spoiled me for over twenty years, so why can't I take your fortune?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I only wanted your wealth. If you'd given it to me sooner, I wouldn't have had to go this far."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula laughed bitterly. "Queenie, after raising you for over two decades, this is how you repay me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie lost control, her rage boiling over. "What was I supposed to do? You stole my mother's place! You turned her into a mistress! My mother endured decades of suffering because of you! Everything I've done was to make sure my parents could be together openly, to let us live as a proper family of four. What's wrong with that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're already filthy rich. What's the big deal about giving your company to my mom? She looked after my dad for you. She earned it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're shameless, Paula! Don't you understand? The one who isn't loved is the mistress. My dad never loved you. He only loved your money. He has plenty of children, but the only one he truly loves is me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula chuckled bitterly. She hadn't expected Queenie to expose herself so thoroughly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie," Paula said, her voice trembling with anger and sorrow, "you and your father deceived me so cruelly. You made me neglect my own daughter. I raised you, only to find out you were the daughter of the mistress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For you, I told everyone that my biological daughter, Diana, was adopted. And you... you sabotaged her at every turn. Queenie, you are nothing but a beast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You manipulated Gale into hurting Diana. You coaxed Frank into helping you steal my company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I adored you, yet you schemed against my flesh and blood. You even drove my daughter away. And you even killed your own child. Doesn't your conscience hurt, Queenie?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie froze, her gaze locked on Paula. Something felt off about her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's accusations sounded more like bait as if she were trying to draw out a confession.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie glanced around the room but saw no cameras or recording devices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still, Paula's demeanor felt too strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula watched Queenie's darting eyes and smirked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew the livestream was buzzing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was determined not to let Queenie's movie succeed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the live chat, viewers flooded the screen with comments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Unbelievable! Ms. Barnes treated Queenie like her own daughter, and this is how Queenie repays her. She's a monster!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Even worse, Queenie's the product of an affair! Her father swapped the daughters so his mistress' child could live a high life. What a twisted story!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[This is too much. I even bought tickets online to watch her movie. Queenie was raised as a real daughter but didn't appreciate it. Now, she's trying to steal her adoptive mother's wealth. She pushed the real daughter out. This is outrageous!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Queenie's disgusting. She's not fit to be a public figure.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[That's it. I'm refunding my ticket. A person this vile doesn't deserve my support. Her thoughts are so twisted. I'm going to boycott this woman for good.]</p></div>
