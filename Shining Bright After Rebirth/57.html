        <h1>Chapter 57 You Disgust Me</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Cecil brought people over, claiming I sent someone to attack his bodyguard. Steven, I swear I didn't do it. It must be Diana framing me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I wouldn't dare to think that way. Steven, can you help me? Can you get Diana to explain to Cecil? It really wasn't me..." Queenie sobbed, pleading.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven spoke softly, "Don't cry, Queenie. I'll bring Diana over right away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's face went pale when she heard his words. Steven always sided with Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hanging up, Steven looked at Diana, his eyes showing a flicker of conflict. "Diana, come with me. Queenie says you set her up..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Enough, Steven. Would you sacrifice yourself for Queenie? What does her issue have to do with me? You want to take me there? Fine, but you'll be dragging my corpse."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was furious. She had already signed a severance letter and a divorce agreement. Why wouldn't they leave her alone?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes flared with anger. "Diana, don't you know Cecil's tactics? Queenie could be in real danger."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sneered, "You can't even protect the woman you love. Are you really fit to be in a relationship?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come with me. I'm giving you one last chance..." Steven insisted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't need your chances. They're revolting to me. If Queenie claims I framed her, let her provide the evidence."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Steven received a video on his phone. He played it, revealing two men on the ground, severely beaten. "Mr. Farley, I'll confess. Diana ordered us to do this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glared at Diana, showing her the video.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing it, Diana felt numb. She laughed bitterly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I thought I'd be free from schemes after leaving. It seems I can't escape. If that's the case, then I'll fight back fiercely."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't understand her meaning and said angrily, "Diana, stop being so vindictive. Come back with me and apologize now. Otherwise, not only will Cecil come after you, but I'll also make you pay!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sneered, her eyes filled with pain. "Make me pay? Mr. Gellar, how exactly do you plan to punish me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll have you jailed. Come back with me right now." His voice was cold, laced with contempt and disgust.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's heart ached, as if scorched by fire. Steven's words were like a knife, cutting deep wounds into her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She tried to escape the abyss of pain, but the more she struggled, the deeper she sank.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Steven in despair, she said, "Fine! Then I'll show you what the truth really is."</span></p></div>
