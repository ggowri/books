        <h1>Chapter 298 Do You Like Him?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace hugged Queenie and gently stroked her waist, and his voice became more gentle. "Queenie, don't worry. I'll help you. Diana dared to plot against you. I'll destroy her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But Frank ruined my reputation. I really didn't know that he would be so stupid." Queenie hated Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace thought, "Frank is an idiot. With what he said, Queenie would hate him so much. The relationship between them can never be repaired."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace narrowed his eyes and held Queenie even tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes were full of disdain. She resisted the urge to push Jace away and thought, "This old jerk! He dares touch me. Just wait and see. Everything in the Foliot family will be mine in a year at most."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie went to see Steven today. To seduce him, she wore a pink hip skirt that perfectly showed her round hips and lean legs. When she bent down slightly, half of her hips could be seen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace moved his hand slightly down to Queenie's hips. Queenie pretended to be shy and said softly, "Mr. Foliot!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing her charming tone, Jace felt a surge of lust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace's action became bolder, and Queenie moved away slightly. "Mr. Foliot, how will you help me?" Her voice was gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The atmosphere in the hall was somewhat tempting. Jace let Queenie sit down next to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He narrowed his sharp eyes and smiled, "I'll deal with it later. You are still the meal lead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace's voice was gentle. He had been a playboy all his life, so he naturally knew what it meant that Queenie did not refuse his touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was still in good health, and he had several young mistresses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as Queenie became Jace's mistress, she could get whatever she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace said, "Queenie, you are very smart. Go to the room and wait for me." His meaning was self-evident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie said, "Mr. Foliot, I'm on my period. Can you wait for a few days?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew what Jace meant. Next time, she would please him without letting him touch her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace was patient. He smiled, called his assistant, and gave orders. After, he asked the butler to serve food and then had lunch with Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana chatted with Alexander for a while and confirmed some things about the work. Alexander stood up and said, "Diana, your plan is good. I like the design very much. I'm waiting for the finished product to be launched."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled brightly. When she was doing business, she felt tired but also very fulfilled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Thank you, Alexander. Thank you for working with me. In the future, I will have more new designs." She thought, "I'm so lucky to cooperate with the future big shot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander knew that Diana was very talented. The Marsh family used all kinds of tricks to belittle her, but they didn't realize that they had missed an excellent girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander looked at Diana with a meaningful gaze and said gently, "Diana, the livestream is very exciting. It feels so good to fight back against those who bullied you, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "Yeah." She knew that the Powell family was wealthy and powerful, and she also knew that it was not easy for Alexander to stay in his family. He ran a business abroad, and then his grandpa allowed him to come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The competition for the position of heir in the Powell family was fierce. Diana looked at Alexander and smiled even more brightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The situation of the Powell family was complicated, but Alexander was an invaluable winner in the business world, and no one could stop his brilliant life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, Diana made connections with Alexander in advance and got a substantial backer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sent Alexander downstairs. When they were talking and walking, Steven, who came to Diana, happened to see them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's handsome face turned a little gloomy. He thought, "Why is Alexander here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was stunned. In the sunshine, Diana looked so beautiful when she smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He inexplicably recalled the words, "After the divorce, she stunned everyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't notice Steven. When Alexander was talking, she listened carefully and smiled happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Alexander got into the car and left, she was still standing there with a bright smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you like him?" A familiar and cold voice suddenly came from behind.</p></div>
