        <h1>Chapter 990 Diana Is Still So Calm</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at Diana's indifferent expression, tears welling up in her eyes. She couldn't understand why, when they were in the same position, was Diana still so calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't hold back and shouted in frustration, "Diana, you know your identity. How can you still be so composed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt like, at times, Queenie was only making things harder for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life didn't always offer reasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to look at Queenie, her expression was calm. "Queenie, is it so hard to accept your fate? So what if you're an illegitimate child or a rich lady? We can't choose our origins, but we can choose the life we want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Instead of pitying yourself for your birth, why not do more projects, earn more money, and make yourself feel more secure?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some things, the more you expect, the worse they turn out. Just give your best effort and stop overthinking it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie froze for a moment. The words "illegitimate child" felt like a slap of shame to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hated it so much, but Diana didn't seem bothered at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana turned to leave, Queenie immediately called out to her, "Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned back to look at her, visibly annoyed. "Queenie, are you done yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie just wanted to get the question off her chest. "Diana, what kind of family did you grow up in? Why is your design talent so much better than mine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Luna couldn't hold back. Before Diana could answer, she loudly responded, "Queenie, you know very well how outstanding Diana is. Asking this question will only make you feel worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie froze. Indeed, she had witnessed firsthand how outstanding Diana was, and yet she still chose to torture herself by seeking the truth that only hurt her more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled bitterly and stared directly at Diana. "Diana, do you enjoy treating me like a clown? You're so capable, yet you choose to pretend to be a country girl, acting like you know nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt her question was well-asked, and a smile curved her lips. "Queenie, so what if I'm toying with you? I've never pretended to be ignorant. You hold yourself high, thinking only of yourself. How could you see my talent when you can't even see past your own nose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In your eyes, there's only you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie pressed her lips, remaining silent. She just stared at Diana for a long moment before saying, "Mario, let's go have dinner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario responded, "Yes, Ms. Marsh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot one last glance at Diana before pushing Queenie away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she left, Cecil felt like the air around them had cleared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I saw the look in her eyes. I think she's going to get even more ruthless. I have a feeling she might still want to target me next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana considered his concern and nodded. It was very likely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was already beyond caring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once a person was cornered, they would do even worse things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As I said before, be extra cautious. Her career in the entertainment industry is over, and she'll become the boss behind an elite team, secretly controlling everything," Diana said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil squinted his eyes, his expression still playful. "Got it! Diana, I know. Let's go have dinner. A good meal should solve all our problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at his carefree smile. Compared to Cecil, she had let go of a lot today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia, however, reminded him, "Mr. Farley, Queenie's fate has changed. She's lucky, just like people say, she's a born lucky one. There's a saying, 'If the East doesn't shine, the West will.' She may not succeed in the entertainment industry, but she'll do well in other fields. From the looks of her fortune, she's still doing well. But she has committed too many wrongs. Let's wait a year. If after a year her luck changes, then you'll win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Cecil exchanged a glance. Both of them trusted Olivia's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled, "Ms. Laurier, thank you for telling us all of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia, wearing a green shirt and white pants, looked fresh and elegant, walking with grace and a radiant smile. She was undeniably beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Farley, there's no need for thanks. You're Diana's friend, and that makes you my friend too," Olivia replied warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia had helped Cecil's father because she was fond of Diana, and she considered him a friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil still felt deeply grateful to her. She was young, beautiful, yet remarkably composed. Perhaps she had seen through fate and human nature. The aura she exuded was captivating, and it left an impression on every man who crossed her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil couldn't help but steal a few glances at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, sitting in the wheelchair, didn't notice his admiring gaze, but Luna did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She narrowed her eyes slightly. There was something off about Cecil's expression, but she didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group entered the private room that Cecil had prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the room, the table was already set with food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes lit up the moment she saw the spread. The table was filled with delicious dishes, and she couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! It's my favorite grilled lobster," Olivia exclaimed, and her eyes sparkled with delight as she looked at the dishes on the table. She couldn't hide her excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled at her, his lips curving upward. There was something about Olivia's smile that made him want to smile along with her, almost involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil scratched his head, feeling a strange sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was also happy. After all, besides sleeping and working, life was all about enjoying food. She had always been a foodie at heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at Olivia and said, "Olivia, it's a gift from Cecil as a token of gratitude. You should eat more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, I won't hold it back," said Olivia as she sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil urged Luna to sit down and eat together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were seated, he handed each of them a lobster, each one quite large.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia started eating without hesitation. The moment she took a bite, it was wonderfully chewy, fresh, and tender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so delicious! I haven't had such fresh lobster since I was abroad." She ate with gusto, not pretending or being coy in the least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil couldn't help but smile. Watching Olivia, Diana, and Luna, he felt at ease. It was so comfortable to be around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the three of them and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, how's the company going recently?" Cecil knew that she had taken over Steven's company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't seem to be pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Busy, busy, and more busy. That's about it," she said, clearly annoyed by the hectic pace of her days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil chuckled, clearly amused by her response. "I know how you feel, but I think busy work can be fulfilling. I've never lived as seriously as I have this year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at the three women. He'd never had female friends before, but now he had three, and their time together was pleasant and sincere. "In over twenty years, this year is the one that's made me feel like I've truly lived. It's been so fulfilling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at his sincere expression, a little surprised. He had truly matured. "Cecil, keep it up. When someone seriously lives life and works hard, guess what happens next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled, his eyes twinkling with curiosity. "What happens, Diana?"</span></p></div>
