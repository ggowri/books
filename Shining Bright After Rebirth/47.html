        <h1>Chapter 47 Haven't You Divorced</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Diana arrived at the private room, Paula was already there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She walked in and sat across from Paula.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula still looked elegant and beautiful, just as she did when she was young. Now, as the mother and daughter sat together, they resembled sisters.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked at how well Diana was doing, dressed beautifully, and she felt an inexplicable sense of relief. Seeing that Diana remained silent, she had to break the silence and asked, "Where have you been staying during this time? Have you found a job?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied indifferently, "Mrs. Marsh, where I stay is none of your concern. Whether I have a job or not is also none of your concern. I won't ask you for a single penny, so you don't need to worry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her still maintaining this cold attitude, the repressed anger inside Paula surged up again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, do you have to be so cold towards me? I am your mother," Paula said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana furrowed her brow, observing the impatience in Paula's eyes. Her voice grew even colder as she said, "If you called me here for these trivial matters, then I will leave."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula became exasperated. "You really are an ungrateful person."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's brow furrowed, appearing displeased. "Paula, have you ever taken care of me for a single day? When I returned to the Marsh family, the clothes I wore were all ones that Queenie didn't want. You prepared hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of clothes for her, while I had to wear what she rejected," she retorted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When I left, I didn't take a single piece of clothing with me. I stayed in your house for a year. How much money do you think I cost your family? I will repay you now," Diana replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Paula was taken aback, a tinge of guilt flashing in her eyes. She hadn't brought it up and had even forgotten that Diana used to wear the clothes rejected by Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She avoided Diana's gaze, hesitant to look at her. "Forget about the money. We are family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at her evasive eyes and couldn't help but find it laughable. "Mrs. Marsh, I am a girl who grew up in the countryside, without education or refinement. I dare not seek connections with your distinguished Marsh family, let alone consider myself as part of your family," she said with a hint of irony.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anything else?" After saying that, Diana lowered her head and transferred one hundred thousand dollars to Paula's account using her mobile phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula had intended to talk about what happened last night, but when she saw that Diana had transferred one hundred thousand dollars to her account, she became completely flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I've already said that we are family. You are my biological daughter, and after you stayed with me for a year, do you think I would ask you for money?" Her chest heaved with anger and she felt conflicted as well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also wanted to shower love on her own daughter, but she always caused trouble and couldn't accept Queenie's presence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana even wanted to sabotage their relationship as a couple, and that was what hurt Paula the most.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Paula's tone might have been a bit harsh at times, it was because her daughter had let her down so much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana said, "I apologize. With one year's worth of rent and expenses, the one hundred thousand dollars should be more than enough. From this moment on, I owe you nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When you looked down on me, your own daughter, did you ever think about why I was switched and taken away?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I had been raised by your side, I might have become an outstanding daughter. But you never held such hopes for me, so don't feel disappointed. Because you are not deserving of it!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And even if you didn't raise me by your side, I am still exceptional. I am outstanding in a way that you cannot reach."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula felt a pang of pain in her chest, looking at Diana's cold gaze. Angered, she retorted, "Diana, you say I'm not fit to be a mother, but are you fit to be a daughter? Why do you always meddle in everything? Last night, you stole Queenie's credit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She grew up with Steven since they were young. There is no emotional connection between the two of you. Why do you keep appearing in his life and entangling him even after the divorce?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you enjoy competing with Queenie that much? Any person with a shred of conscience wouldn't do what you did. Why do you always want what belongs to Queenie?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a pang of pain in her heart. This was the real reason why Paula had sought her out today - to blame her for something she didn't do.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana remained silent and pulled out Steven's phone number from her blocked contacts list. She made a call to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where are you?" she asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was surprised that Diana called him. He suddenly felt that Diana knew his mistake and wanted to come back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he said, "I'm meeting a client at the club."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew that he liked to meet clients at this club. "Come to Room 402," she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Diana finished speaking, she hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula furrowed her brow and asked, "Who are you calling?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mrs. Marsh, you will find out shortly. As I have said before, I will not allow myself to be bullied by you anymore, nor will I let you falsely accuse me," Diana replied firmly with determination.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was determined to force Steven to divorce. In this lifetime, she would not have any further involvement with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana remained calm as she sat there, but Paula couldn't help but feel restless, wondering if they were about to misunderstand Diana again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula and Diana sat quietly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana lowered his eyebrows. Paula felt a little uneasy, thinking, "Could it be that Diana was wronged again this time?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Paula was lost in her thoughts, Steven pushed the door open and entered the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tall figure exuded a strong presence that was somewhat intimidating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was also surprised to see Paula there.</span></p></div>
