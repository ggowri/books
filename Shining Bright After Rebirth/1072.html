        <h1>Chapter 1072 Birthday</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Diana's gradually collapsing face, Steven felt a bit distressed. He was afraid she'd get angry and kick him out, so he deliberately recorded the video for her to see.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't trying to do anything. He had hurt her too much in the past. Her guarded eyes always pierced his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, look! You can't bear to let me go." Steven suddenly leaned closer to her, his breath brushing against Diana's ear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His deep and melodious voice was enough to captivate, making her feel as if a current ran through her body, leaving her heart tingling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, thinking, "If this continues, my heart will get lost again. No, I need to stay away from him. I must protect myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly got out of bed and glared at Steven. "Stay away from me and don't get so close. From now on, if I fall asleep, let me sleep on the couch. With the heater on, I can sleep just fine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her wary and angry expression, Steven finally gave up. He just wanted to be closer to her. He couldn't restrain his desire to be near her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes dimmed. "Alright. Even if you cling to me tightly in the future, I'll keep my distance from you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, thinking, "This is clearly the result I wanted. So why do I feel so heavy inside?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pressing the spot over her heart, Diana thought, "Forget it, I'll go freshen up first. I'm so hungry." Then, she headed to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gently watched her limping figure. He had slept well last night. After she fell asleep, her soft skin made him reluctant to let go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he couldn't resist and fell asleep holding her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven also got up to freshen up and get ready for work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half a month passed quietly like this. With careful care, Diana's leg finally regained the ability to walk freely. However, she couldn't walk too fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's legs also recovered quickly under her care.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another month passed, and spring arrived. Andrew was calm, and Queenie was recovering from her injuries. So, Diana enjoyed a rare month of peace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time quickly arrived at Diana's birthday. Steven also knew it was her birthday today, so he had Evan prepare a birthday gift for Diana in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because it was Diana's birthday today, Leopold and Julius both returned to make sure she had a happy birthday.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They set the birthday party venue at the most luxurious restaurant in Capitole, where every private room is independent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The silver private room was filled with greenery, creating a pleasant environment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After work, Diana changed into a pink outfit and went straight to the private room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The private room was semi-enclosed, with a hollowed-out silver partition, looking very elegant and luxurious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stood at the private room door, waiting for Julius and Leopold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven came along with her. However, he changed his appearance and is now sitting in the private room drinking coffee.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far away, George also brought Queenie and Dylan over for dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's birthday was a few days ago, so they came here today just for a meal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From a distance, Queenie immediately spotted Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said, "Dylan, isn't that Diana? What is she doing here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan also saw Diana. She looked beautiful today, wearing a pink dress with her long hair draped over her shoulders. Her delicate makeup made her features even more striking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a cold laugh, Dylan said, "She probably knows Steven is coming here, so she wants to get back together with him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A hint of coldness appeared in Queenie's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George's gaze was somber, but he felt elated inside. He thought, "Will Diana come to me? Diana is really beautiful. If she comes to me, I won't refuse."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the three of them, Diana ignored them and instead looked at the handsome man walking past them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She exclaimed excitedly, shouting, "My dear brother, you're finally here! Come over and give me a hug. I missed you so much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was stunned, thinking, "Since when did Diana and I become so close? She wants me to hug her? Why would I hug a country bumpkin? She hurt Queenie so badly, yet she still wants me to hug her. She's dreaming."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said harshly, "Diana, if you want me to hug you, you have to apologize to Queenie first and return the company to Steven. Then, I might reluctantly hug you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie also looked at Diana with ill intentions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, they saw a strong, tall figure pass by them and run toward Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana raised her arms and jumped into Julius's embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Julius, I missed you so much." Diana's voice was loud, choked with deep longing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was stunned. Thinking of his overly narcissistic words earlier, he felt extremely embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "So the brother Diana was calling wasn't me. But seeing her so close with another brother, I feel pretty upset. I'm clearly Diana's real brother, yet she's never called me that affectionately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, did you miss me?" Julius asked. His words brought tears to Diana's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I missed you so much." Diana's eyes were red from crying. "Julius, I'm sorry. I was too willful before and hurt you all. I won't do it again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had already made up her mind earlier that the first thing she would do upon seeing Julius was to apologize.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius smiled and tapped her pretty nose with his finger. "I knew Diana has grown up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked around but didn't see Hubery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt sad and asked dejectedly, "Julius, does Hubery still refuse to forgive me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them were standing at the private room's door, so Steven could hear what they were saying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius sighed slightly and said, "Hubery was very angry when he found out you were going to marry Steven. On the night you and Steven got your marriage license, he was worried you might be mistreated, so he drove to wait outside the villa where you lived. However, he saw Steven leave right after dropping you off. That completely infuriated him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He bought a plane ticket and left the country the next day. He didn't want to see you degrading yourself, so he stayed away for three years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt even sadder and asked in surprise, "Did Hubery wait for me outside the villa back then?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius replied, "Yes. He waited until dawn before leaving. Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t cherish you, and you were degrading yourself, so he was heartbroken and left the country the next day. He said he never wanted to hear about you again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her cry, Julius wiped away her tears. "Now that you've figured things out, Hubery will surely forgive you. He was angry because you didn't love yourself properly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are the Diana we spoiled growing up. We couldn't even bear to see you frown. What right do they have to bully you? I came back to get revenge for you. From now on, you must love yourself well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew Hubery cared deeply for her. However, she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t expect that he had waited outside the villa for her all night back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery was the same age as her. When they were kids, she always followed him around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias and Julius were a bit older than them, so only Hubery and she had many topics to talk about.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She nodded happily. "Alright. Julius, once I</span><span>'</span><span>ve sorted everything out, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll go bring Hubery back. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll never do anything to disappoint you again. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll be good."</span></p></div>
