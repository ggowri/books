        <h1>Chapter 217 Let Go of Me</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana has plenty of ways to prove that she painted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her anger had reached its peak, and she had never endured any grievance since her rebirth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would fight back if necessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Otherwise, others would think she was easy to bully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned. "Did you draw the designs?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie asked first, "Diana, you can't design, so you accuse others of plagiarism. Do you still have any shame?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Emma was the best designer in your company before. Why did she copy your designs? What achievements have you made? Have you won any design awards? How dare you claim that Emma plagiarized your works?" She laughed out of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana also laughed. She went over and grabbed Queenie by the hair.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, what are you doing? Let go of me," Queenie screamed in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered, "Queenie, from today on, I'm going to repeat how you used to frame me. Do you remember the scene? Knowing Steven was coming, you deliberately messed up your hair and said I pulled your hair. When I am really doing so, you should scream like a shrew instead of crying harshly like your father is dead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana fixed her bloodshot eyes on Steven, who stood motionless. "Ask Emma to come downstairs, or I will make things difficult for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He instructed Evan to call Emma and ask her to come downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan immediately reached her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was speechless. Why was Diana so persistent?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, let go of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned her around three times and then threw her into Steven's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sobbed, "Steven..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana warned word by word, "Remember, Queenie, you have framed me a total of eighty-six times, and each time, you have planned the timing. I still have vivid memories of them, some serious, some minor. The worst was six months ago when you plotted against Gale and blamed it on me and Althea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared at her icily and sadly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie roared, "Diana, you are crazy. I didn't do those things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, I'm crazy. You are shameless. You have ended my life once already. So why should I put up with you? I don't mind dying again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She glared at Steven with sharp eyes. His handsome face betrayed his coldness and ruthlessness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, you don't deserve to live. I will have my revenge on you to the hour of your death. I will personally send you to hell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's eyes were bloodshot with rage. She wanted to kill Steven and Queenie to avenge her stillborn baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her tears streamed down nonstop, and grief overwhelmed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt very, very aggrieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frowning, Steven sensed her intense hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was what he had done to her that had made her hate him so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was dumbfounded. Diana was really scary at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed that she had been cornered. Only impulsive people would do stupid things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Emma appeared in the lobby. She was wearing a burgundy dress that accentuated her perfectly curvy figure. Most of her back was exposed, and the curve of her back was delicate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She walked over gracefully in her stiletto heels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana approached her, said nothing, and beat her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma screamed and fell to the floor awkwardly. Looking at Diana, she shouted aggrievedly, "You mad woman, who are you? Why did you hit me?"</p></div>
