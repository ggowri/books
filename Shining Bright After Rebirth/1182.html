        <h1>Chapter 1182 Dragon and Phoenix Twins, Happy Ending</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven would definitely stay. Grandpa and Grandma could handle the company, and with Mom and Dad back, they could share the workload. This Christmas, he'd stick around and take good care of Diana. He'd been running himself ragged these past few years anyway, and getting to spend every day with Diana? That made him happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, I want to stay and look after Diana." Steven smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop chuckled. "Good!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darnell Bishop got ignored again, and he was pissed. "Tobias, you really don't give a damn about me, do you? We're still standing right here, and you're already playing happy family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yuki Bishop was just as furious. "Diana, this is all your fault! Everything's because of you! If you hadn't come back, everything Copper has would be mine. You know why he never had an heir? Because we made sure he could never get married. Every woman he tried to marry would die in some 'accident,' and he could never have a son."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We've been planning this for over twenty years, and you just waltz in at the last second. Either you leave, or you die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I clawed my way to where I am today. I sure as hell won't let you steal what I've earned."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yuki Bishop couldn't accept defeat. That old bastard had left this place, secretly raised Copper's daughter, and now she'd swooped in to become the heir while Yuki got nothing. After waiting all these years for jack shit, she couldn't take it. She had to get back everything that was hers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's faces went ice-cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's blood boiled. All these years, Dad must've been exhausted living under these people's schemes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastards! How dare you treat my father like this! Looks like I went too easy on you before."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to her father. "Dad, they've done so much sick stuff. Send them to prison. To cut out this cancer for good, people like this can't be left running around."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yuki Bishop stared at Diana in terror. She'd been too angry and spilled everything they'd done. All for the heir position, they'd made sure Copper Bishop could never marry or have kids his entire life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darnell Bishop shot his daughter a cold look without saying a word, then hung his head in defeat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne just glared daggers at her daughter. "Shut your mouth. Nobody's asking you to talk."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, I can't accept this! Everything was supposed to be ours today..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop cut her off. "Butler, send all these people and the bodyguards outside to prison. My daughter's hungry. Don't keep my precious girl from her lunch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yuki Bishop's eyes went wide. "No! Copper, no! Please, I don't want to go to jail!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Copper Bishop didn't give her another chance to speak. They were all dragged away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blinked in surprise. "Dad, is that it? Just like that? Grandpa told me to come back for some family drama?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold laughed. "You little troublemaker, you've been fighting for almost an hour. Haven't you had enough? How could Grandpa bear to let you come back just to get schemed against by them? I spent this Christmas away specifically to undermine their partnerships. I worked with your three brothers to cut off all the other branch families' deals, just so you could come back to some peace and quiet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's heart clenched, flooded with warmth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, Dad, thank you. All these years, I just enjoyed everything you gave me but never helped carry any of the family burden."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt guilty. Not only had she never helped with family business, but she'd also wasted three whole years. During those three years, Grandpa and Dad must've been worried sick about her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop took her hand. "Silly girl, you and your younger siblings, plus your three brothers, have been running the company just fine. That's already the biggest help you could give us. With the outside threats handled, dealing with the internal Bishop family stuff will be a piece of cake."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So don't blame yourself. You're my precious daughter, and how could Daddy bear to let you suffer? How could I bear to see you go through hardship?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt her father's devoted love, and tears began to fall again. She had so many people who loved her in this lifetime. In her past life, why had she never met her father? What a wonderful feeling this was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, don't cry anymore. Daddy can't stand to see you shed tears. Aren't you hungry? Let's go have lunch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana: "Mm-hmm, Daddy, I'm so hungry. I want lamb."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, of course! Whatever you want to eat, we have it." Copper Bishop smiled with pure affection, his handsome face radiating joy. Everyone headed to the dining room for lunch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three days later, the Bishop and Young families set the wedding date. Diana's morning sickness was quite severe, so the doctor advised against getting married right away. They decided to hold the wedding after the baby was born.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During Diana's pregnancy, Steven took care of her with utmost devotion, and Diana was blissfully happy. Throughout this time, Diana regularly received wonderful news from her close friends. Cecil and Olivia got married. Despite Cecil's playboy reputation, he absolutely adored Olivia. Evan and Luna also tied the knot&mdash;Luna had no morning sickness and was practically skipping down the aisle. Gale and Althea got married too. Tobias and Iris started dating. Julius and Paige also got married. In this lifetime, they had all found their own happiness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After more than eight months, Diana gave birth to twins&mdash;a boy and a girl. Steven personally chose names for both children. Their daughter was named Isadora Gellar, and their son Finn Gellar. Both names carried echoes of their parents' names, representing the fruit of their love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the following spring, Isadora and Finn were already walking. Steven and Diana held their wedding of the century at the Bishop estate. This nationally celebrated wedding dominated the trending topics for three days and nights.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With all their family and friends as witnesses, Steven finally fulfilled his lifelong dream&mdash;to have a grand wedding with Diana, letting the entire world know that Diana was his Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Late that night, after all the guests had left, Steven tucked the children into bed before returning to the bridal suite. The room was decorated festively, and Diana stood by the window in her red gown. Despite having given birth to two children, her figure remained as stunning as ever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes were tender, glowing with happiness as he walked over and wrapped his arms around her from behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and asked, "Are the babies asleep?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven rested his head on her shoulder, and hearing her voice, he lifted his head to kiss her lips softly. His voice was gentle: "Mm, they're sleeping. Diana, those two little ones are so well-behaved. Diana, thank you for giving me such happiness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He intertwined his fingers with hers and whispered, "Diana, I didn't know how to express my love before, and I let you suffer. But from now on, you're my one and only. I'll spend my entire life protecting you. In the future, I want to walk through every spring, summer, fall, and winter with you, making you the happiest woman in the world."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to embrace his waist, her beautiful eyes sparkling with blissful joy. "Steven, I'm already the happiest woman in the world."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled tenderly and leaned down to kiss her lips. The night was long, but their entire future together would be filled with happiness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&mdash;&mdash;The End</span></p></div>
