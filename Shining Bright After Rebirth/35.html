        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got it," Evan answered. In his opinion, Queenie had brought all this on herself.He didn't say more and started driving Steven to the Marsh family residence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then did Steven remember&mdash;it had been nearly four months, and he still didn't know where Diana lived.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tomorrow, find out where Diana lives."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan thought, "It took you four months to think about where she lives?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to hold back, he muttered, "I feel sorry for Ms. Bishop. Her family doesn't care about her. When something goes wrong, it's always her fault. When they need her, they come begging, but no one ever treats her like a real person. Leaving was probably the best option for her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes snapped open, glaring at Evan as he drove. He wanted to argue, but he had to admit, Evan was making sense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's just too cruel," said Steven, as if thinking that way would make him feel better.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said no more. The truly cruel one was Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no one would believe him even if he said so. Maybe it was the perspective of an outsider, but from where he stood, Queenie was just no good.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they arrived at the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked in, immediately seeing Queenie sitting on the couch, crying. A wave of irritation crossed his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff saw Steven arrive and breathed a sigh of relief. It meant he still cared about Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, come sit down."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked over gracefully, though his inner frustration showed in his handsome face, now marked by a hint of aggression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie saw Steven and knew he still cared about her, feeling overjoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was much more gentle than that other man, but she loved the other man more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, you came," she said, lowering her head, tears of grievance streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned. "Stop crying. Cecil didn't do anything."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I know. I just feel wronged. I tried to save the old lady too." Queenie trailed off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula also felt upset. Diana's words hurt her deeply. Was Diana really going to disown her own mother?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The disownment letter was just to scare her, but she actually left for good.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tonight, they'd wronged her again. As her mother, Paula felt terrible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then she thought about how Diana had ruined her marriage, and anger bubbled up again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you want from me?" Steven asked, sounding irritated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff looked at him intently. Steven was ruthless&mdash;except towards Queenie. He showed no kindness to anyone else.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, Jeff had been pulling strings behind the scenes all these years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff didn't hold back. "Steven, you and Queenie grew up together. Now that you're divorcing Diana, you two should get married soon."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stared back at him. "I haven't divorced Diana yet."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff froze, taken aback. He'd seen them sign the divorce papers with his own eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I'm not forcing you to marry Queenie. But you've known each other forever. You have a deep bond. Queenie's sacrificed a lot for you. You two are a perfect match. The sooner you marry, the more at ease we'll all be. We just want to see our daughter happy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing that last sentence, Steven suddenly stood up, "Diana is your daughter too. She's my wife. Don't you want her to be happy?"</span></p></div>
