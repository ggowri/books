        <h1>Chapter 1132 An Unexpected Guest</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was captivated by her radiant smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded firmly. "Yes! I dream about it every night. Diana, what do I have to do for you to forgive me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana already had an idea. "Tomorrow, go buy supplies and fold me 99 stars and 99 paper cranes. Once you're done, I'll tell you the next step."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven jumped up excitedly. "Diana, I'll go buy them right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his urgency, Diana chuckled. "No need to rush. Go tomorrow morning instead. This isn't something you can finish in a day or two&mdash;you'll need to learn first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's heart swelled. She was forgiving him so easily. Meeting her felt like the luckiest thing that had ever happened to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! I'll do whatever you say." Steven pulled her into his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana ignored him and kept her head down, engrossed in her novel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that moment, a bright light pierced through the darkness of Steven's life!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was so overjoyed she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know what to do with herself. She had just landed a massive international deal. The new year had begun, and everything was unfolding exactly as she had hoped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario stood beside her, dressed in an expensive tailored suit, barely able to contain his excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, I've been tracking this deal for six months. We finally sealed the contract."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie reached out and lightly patted his handsome face. "Mario, you</span><span>'</span><span>ve done an amazing job this time. What do you want as a reward?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario pulled her into his arms, gazing deeply into her eyes. "Queenie, all I</span><span>'</span><span>ve ever wanted is you. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll stand by your side, always. I have just one wish&mdash;marry me. I promise, no one in this world will ever love you more than I do."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's chest tightened. In her memories, it was Mario who stood by her until the very end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie spoke softly, "Alright! Once Diana and Steven are dealt with, I'll marry you. And I'll even give you a son."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was exactly what Mario wanted. In the end, he was the one who would win.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, Queenie. For you, I</span><span>'</span><span>m willing to do anything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario leaned down and captured her lips in a kiss&mdash;possessive, deep, and utterly consuming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sometimes, Queenie feared Mario's dominance, but the more he cared for her, the happier she felt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had no other choice&mdash;no other man would love her the way he did. As long as she stayed by his side, his ruthlessness would never be directed at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the office, Paula eyed the contract Queenie had just signed, her gaze dripping with mockery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had taken a full six months, but Queenie had finally taken the bait.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric looked at his mom, still trying to grasp the rules of the business world after months of learning from her. "Mom, does this mean the plan worked?" he asked hesitantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t understand the true value of that contract.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula let out a cold laugh. "I spent six months setting this trap, luring Mario in. That contract is a ticking time bomb. Does Queenie really think she</span><span>'</span><span>s about to strike it rich?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I started learning business from my dad when I was 16. By 18, I was attending social events with him. At 26, I fell into a contract trap and got played. That was when my funds dried up, and I met Diana's father."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was desperate back then, but he handed me a hundred million dollars, helping our family rise to new heights."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Paula spoke, her eyes filled with tears. "But I was wrong. All those years, Jeff deceived me. I failed to teach you better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula turned to her son. "But now, it's not too late. We can still fix everything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The environment you live in matters so much. Meeting the wrong person can ruin your entire life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric gave a small smile. "Mom, thank you! Thank you for never giving up on us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula let out a bitter laugh. "You</span><span>'</span><span>re my sons, no matter who your father is. Alright, now let</span><span>'</span><span>s just wait for Queenie to rot in hell."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula gazed out the window. But deep down, she knew her daughter would never forgive her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears shimmered in Paula's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric could see her sadness. He said, "Mom, let's go. We need to take Gale to Althea's house today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula nodded slightly. "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the afternoon, Diana received a call from Althea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was halfway through her novel. Steven, not a fan of reading, leaned against Diana and dozed off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's phone vibrated, waking him up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea said, "Diana, my son just said 'Mom'! You guys have to come over. Let's celebrate tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was thrilled. "Oh my gosh! He said 'Mom'? I'm coming right over. What do you want to eat? I'll bring it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea said, "Don't bring anything. You already bought so many clothes last time, the baby can't even wear them all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana chuckled, "I'll be there soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at Steven. "Are you coming?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven replied, "Yeah, I'm coming."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I'll go change. Let's go see the baby."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven noticed her eyes light up when she said "baby."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Steven thought their son would come back too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two changed clothes, stopped by the mall to pick up some gifts, and then headed to Althea's house.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea still lived with her parents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea's mom, Marie, was surprised to see Diana and Steven show up together, but she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t ask any questions. Instead, she happily welcomed them inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marie, how have you been lately?" Diana asked with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marie, a kind woman with a gentle smile, replied, "Diana, I've been good. But with a little grandson now, life</span><span>'</span><span>s gotten busier. Taking care of a baby is exhausting. I</span><span>'</span><span>m not as young as I used to be&mdash;it</span><span>'</span><span>s a bit overwhelming."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew that even though Marie was tired, she loved the baby deeply and took great care of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marie, make sure to get plenty of rest," Diana said gently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure! Come on in. Althea and Paige are inside playing with the baby," Marie said warmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, "Alright, Marie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana walked in with Steven and immediately saw little Harlan, now walking on his own, reaching out his tiny hands toward her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana handed her bag over to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knelt down and scooped Harlan into her arms. "Harlan, I'm here to see you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stood up with Harlan in her arms as he planted a kiss on her cheek. "Diana... Diana," he babbled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stammered as he spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was overjoyed. It had been nearly six months since she last saw Harlan. "Althea, Harlan can say my name now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea and Paige stared in shock at Steven standing behind her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why was Steven here too?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paige asked in surprise, "Did you two make up?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied, "Not yet. He's still chasing me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea, however, thought the two of them were a perfect match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, why make him chase you? You've loved him for so many years. The misunderstanding's cleared up&mdash;just get together already and have a baby soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled, "Thanks, Althea. But I'll make sure to win Diana over myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea said, "Well, good luck! Plenty of couples have broken up before. Love that endures hardships only grows stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Althea finished speaking, the doorbell suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea frowned in confusion. "I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t invite anyone. Who could it be now?"</span></p></div>
