        <div>Steven looked at Evan and asked, "Evan, I told you to find a villa nearby. Did you manage to find one?"Evan replied, "Mr. Gellar, I've checked all the villas in the area, but none are suitable. The villas around here are all in great demand. There are very few vacancies, and none are on the market."</div>
