        <h1>Chapter 155 Being Thrown Out</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was shocked by Luna's strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna looked at Gale and sneered, "Has everyone in the Marsh family always been so rude? Don't you know to knock on the door before entering? Diana is no longer a member of the Marsh family. Shouldn't you be polite?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he went to pick up Diana, she was living in a dilapidated asbestos-tiled house in the countryside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale wondered why Luna treated Diana so obediently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale thought Diana was good at pretending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale looked at Luna's cold face, wanting to say something but stopping himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Miss, what should we do now?" Luna knew that Diana hated all members of the Marsh family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Throw him out. Tell the security guards downstairs not to let anyone of the Marsh family in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana glanced at Gale coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale sneered, "Diana, do you think you are different? Aren't you a part of the Marsh family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale didn't believe that Diana had the privilege.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought that Diana was too arrogant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, are you worthy of being my family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale felt awkward and said, "I didn't think carefully about this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana said directly, "Gale, you are not inconsiderate. You just want me to be criticized by everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I won't cripple you. Someone else is the one who crippled you. I've already warned you not to participate in the automobile race."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana finished speaking and she did not give Gale a chance to refute. "Luna, drag him out. Just throw him in the elevator, and tell him to get out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale got up from the ground in humiliation. "Diana, if you hadn't plotted against me half a year ago, how could I have disappointed Penelope?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's all because of you guys plotting against me. That's why I hurt my goddess."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was shocked by the word "goddess" used by Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at Gale with complicated eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, a woman who is available to anyone, lives a dissolute life, and often goes in and out of hotels and bars is your goddess?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale frowned. He became furious. "Diana, you are not allowed to insult Penelope. She would not do anything to let me down. She just likes to go to the bar to have fun. The real vicious people are you and Althea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana narrowed her eyes slightly. The cold wind blew, and her hair fluttered. She looked bright and gorgeous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She said lazily, "Gale, go now. I've said what I should say and explained what I should explain. It's you who don't believe it. Don't regret it when you see Althea in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was stunned. He didn't believe Diana's explanation. "Do you have any evidence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The evidence is simple. You can follow Penelope secretly for a while and watch how your goddess has fun. As for what happened half a year ago, it's not that I can't give you evidence, but Althea was the one who was hurt. Althea is the person who you feel most sorry for in this life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana turned around and faced away from Gale, not wanting to say any more nonsense to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna grabbed Gale by the collar and walked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was furious that he was dragged away by a girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Let me go." Gale tried to put Luna's hands off him, but he couldn't.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale said with fear, "You little bitch! You look so skinny, but how come you have so much strength? It's so embarrassing for a grown man like me to be dragged by you like this. Let me go quickly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Let me go quickly. I won't be rude to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna sneered, "If there wasn't such a huge difference in height between you and me, I would have carried you away long ago. Don't waste my time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna opened the elevator door and threw Gale in. "Get out, idiot!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ahhh..." Gale was furious. It was so embarrassing that he was thrown out by a girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna turned and left quickly.</p></div>
