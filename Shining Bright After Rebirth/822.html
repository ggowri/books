        <h1>Chapter 822 Doesn't Want a Divorce</h1>
        <div>"Mr. Foliot, I'm still alive, but your affair with Amelie is also very real. My only goal now is to divorce you. I've brought the divorce agreement with me. I don't want a single thing from the Foliot family, all I want is to take what's rightfully mine. As for the kids, I don't want custody of them</div>
