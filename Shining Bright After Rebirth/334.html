        <h1>Chapter 334 Assault</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was still burning up, but his mind was clear.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He leaned against Diana's chest, feeling the softness and inhaling her sweet scent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The scent was enchanting and made him feel at ease.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned his head slightly, accidentally pressing his face against Diana's soft spot.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His handsome face flushed even more, but Diana didn't seem to notice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven and Alexander, however, did notice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's gaze darkened, wanting Diana to let go of Cecil.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander pulled Cecil up. "Kid, get up and explain yourself."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil looked confused. "Say what? About what?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I saw you enter the room, so I followed. What's going on with me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana followed Rita's words directly. "Queenie drugged you to seduce you. You were drugged."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn, these bitches! Isn't serving Mr. Foliot enough? Now she wants to seduce me too?" Cecil stomped his foot in anger but felt weak and slumped onto a seat across from Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at Queenie, shocked. "What's going on? Why are you wearing the same outfit as Diana, even with the same hairstyle?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I only came in because I saw you enter the room."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana quickly turned to Queenie, stunned. Queenie's outfit was very similar to hers, even down to the hairstyle.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's scheme to frame Cecil was indeed cunning.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glared at Queenie's deceitful face. "Queenie, you weren't wearing this outfit earlier.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You put on a wig and the same dress as mine, lured Cecil into the room, and now you're accusing him of assaulting you? Queenie, do you have no shame?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie almost lost her balance at Cecil's last words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face turned pale. The plan was to lure both Steven and Cecil here with her outfit.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Coincidentally, Steven was an unexpected helper. The outfit he prepared in his car was quite similar to Diana's.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment she got the clothes and distanced herself from Jace, she was surprised at how things seemed to go her way.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She approached Steven, determined to make Diana despise him completely.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, Steven prepared this outfit for me. I just wore the wig to complete the hairstyle. It was Steven's thoughtful gesture, so I couldn't refuse.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But Cecil's assault on me happened. You weren't here earlier, but Steven and Mr. Foliot saw it with their own eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Foliot has already called the police. I want justice for myself, but you're turning it around, accusing me of seducing Cecil? Why would I seduce him? At an event like this, would I joke about my reputation?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you've always taken pleasure in framing me. Everyone saw what happened. I'd like to see how you can falsely accuse me now."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's long lashes were covered with tears, making her look delicate. At this moment, she cried uncontrollably.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked both beautiful and fragile, pale and weak, her slender figure evoking pity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had to admit that Queenie played the innocent role to perfection.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It took Cecil a moment to grasp what Queenie meant. Pointing to himself, he stared at her. "You're saying I tried to assault you?"</p></div>
