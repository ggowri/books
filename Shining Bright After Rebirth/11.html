        <h1>Chapter 11 I Want to Be Strong</h1>
        <div><p>Diana&#x27;s beautiful eyes were filled with tears. &quot;In order to marry Steven, I seldom contacted you. It hurt Grandpa&#x27;s heart.</p><p>&quot;Julius completely ignored me. Hubery hated me and went abroad. Only you stayed by my side regardless of the past.</p><p>&quot;Tobias, I will never be stupid again. I won&#x27;t love Steven anymore. I swear.</p><p>&quot;If...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Enough.&quot; Tobias interrupted her with a smile and said in a doting voice, &quot;Silly girl, you made me cry. Just be true to yourself, and leave the rest to retribution.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay!&quot; Diana nodded heavily. &quot;Tobias, I will not let anyone who makes me sad going well.&quot;</p><p>She thought, &quot;What&#x27;s the use of apologizing? Queenie stole my life. I&#x27;ll live her life this time.&quot;</p><p>Tobias took Diana back to Breeze Villa.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Breeze Villa was a manor villa covering an area of 37,673 square feet. The walls were made of white jade, with ten-meter-high floor-to-ceiling windows. It had a vast space and was gorgeous everywhere.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was her favorite style of decor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Leopold lived on the first floor, and she lived on the second floor. Tobias lived on the third floor, and Julius and Hubery lived on the fourth floor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Each floor contained their favorite entertainment venues. She lived on the second floor, where there was a 1,291-square-foot library and a gym next door.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She grew up here. When the Marsh family found her, she had been training in the countryside. So, the Marsh family had always thought she was a country girl who was not presentable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had fallen in love with Steven at first sight and chosen to cut off contact with Leopold to marry him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, she thought she was such a fool.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Grandpa, I&#x27;m back,&quot; shouted Diana as she entered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Leopold looked at Diana&#x27;s injured foot and asked, &quot;You walked out and came back lying down. What&#x27;s wrong with you? Did you encounter a ghost?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was sad. &quot;I indeed encountered a ghost.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was a person scarier than a ghost.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana instantly raised his head excitedly and said loudly, &quot;Grandpa, my life is in my own hands. If the god wants to destroy me, I will destroy him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Boom...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just as Diana finished speaking, lightning flashed outside.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana shrank her neck.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Leopold widened his wise eyes and said, &quot;Diana, being happy is the most important thing. Don&#x27;t make the god angry. I... I&#x27;m going to sleep. It&#x27;s thundering. I&#x27;m afraid of thunder.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought, &quot;I just want to stay away from this doomsayer.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Leopold jumped away, just like a runaway child.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was speechless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tobias was overjoyed. With Diana at home, Leopold always avoided her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, come on. I&#x27;ll take you back to your room. Think positively. We need to look forward. If we don&#x27;t miss out on those crappy things, how can we know what is the best?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tobias stood up and carried Diana on his back.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana felt that Tobias&#x27; words were right. It was difficult to change fate. But she could change herself. &quot;Tobias, I see. I want to be strong.&quot;</p></div>
