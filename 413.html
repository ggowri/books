  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only silver lining was that Bruce seemed disinclined to make a move against Osborne. Whether it was disdain for engaging or waiting for an opportunity to deliver a lethal strike remained unclear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, Osborne was in peril.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce's presence rendered interdimensional travel impossible. Even without Bruce's offensive, facing five Class A masters head-on offered no chance of victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should I do?" Osborne's mind raced for a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the enemy would not cease their assault to await his strategizing. Seeing Osborne withstand their combined attack left them utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their onslaught did not relent. A barrage of relentless strikes pounded Osborne's level six Devil's Light. Despite its formidable defensive capabilities, it could not hold against such an onslaught. It fluctuated violently, on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This won't do. I must strike back! Even if I'm to die here, I'll take some of them with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He launched a fierce punch, repelling three close-combat masters. His Satan's Eye flickered, casting illusions into the minds of the trio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, their expressions turned vacant for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now's my chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bellowed, his Devil's Light retracting and condensing around his fist. Then, he delivered a devastating punch towards the three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the peril, they quickly broke free from the illusions but were too late to dodge, only managing to unleash their martial art auras in a desperate attempt to block the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This punch, however, was Osborne at his most powerful, with no reservations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Transformed into a vampire, he had imbued his level six Devil's Light into the force of the punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This punch represented the pinnacle of Osborne's offensive might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a terrifying power erupted, causing massive waves to surge on the sea surface, and the seabed resembled the aftermath of a missile strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Class A martial masters' eyes widened with horror as they were blasted away by the overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them, still in retreat, exploded on the spot, dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two, luckier for not being directly hit, were sent crashing into large seabed boulders, sliding to the ground, spitting blood, unable to rise for a long while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 7 was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she was immensely relieved she hadn't been at the forefront, avoiding Osborne's punch, or she might have been the one to be killed with that single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? Satan's Eye? You're actually from the Augustine family in Newport City! What's your connection to Godfather?" Bruce spoke in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paid no heed to the Class A martial master killed by Osborne, staring at him with astonishment as if the man's death was of no consequence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Satan's Eye had flared, casting illusions onto the three, and he had finally discerned it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was stern as he offered no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce's expression turned icy. "Your silence is futile! Satan's Eye is the inherited power of the Augustine family in Newport City. Only descendants of the Augustine family can awaken Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you possess Satan's Eye, you must be from the Augustine family in Newport City, and you must be related to Godfather. I had intended to let you live a while longer, but since you're connected to Godfather, you cannot be spared! I will kill you myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Bruce, leaning on his cane, approached Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared to walk slowly, but his movements were incredibly swift. In an instant, he stood before Osborne, gently tapping his cane towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's eyes twitched violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he retrieved the Guardian Shield from Dimensional Space, placing it against his chest. The shield burst forth with a powerful energy, condensing into a grizzly bear made of energy, standing before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next moment, the cane lightly tapped the grizzly's chest, causing it to collapse instantly as if it had no defensive power at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the cane tapped the Guardian Shield itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force erupted from the cane. The shield let out a mournful cry under the strain, and Osborne's level six Devil's Light and martial art aura shattered in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spat out a mouthful of blood, his body hurtling backward, smashing through everything in his path, finally coming to rest hundreds of feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't die? There are few young ones who can withstand a single strike from me and live! Another genius has emerged from the Augustine family in Newport City! In that case, you must die even more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce's face turned even colder. He took a step, crossing hundreds of feet in an instant, reappearing before Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his cane, pointing it down towards Osborne's chest once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was severely injured, feeling intense pain in his arm, unable even to lift the Guardian Shield. His level six Devil's Light and martial art aura had been dispersed and required time to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Bruce's attack, he had no power to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I going to die? I haven't completed all the Godfather's heir tests. I haven't become the new Godfather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I haven't cured my sister's illness. I haven't married Clarissa. I haven't even gotten Isa... Am I going to die now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne distinctly sensed the breath of death. He could only watch helplessly as Bruce's cane pierced into his body.</span></p><div class="pagination">
