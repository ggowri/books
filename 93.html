  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Aunt Donna, it&rsquo;s your favorite flavor,&rdquo; Clarissa said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wasn&rsquo;t particularly fond of candies, but everyone in the Radcliffe family knew that Donna had a sweet tooth and couldn&rsquo;t go a day without them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not wanting to spoil the moment, Clarissa decided to try one herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, her phone buzzed with a message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa glanced at it, and her face lit up with delight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The message was from Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With eager anticipation, she opened it, but her expression quickly changed to one of shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Ms. Clarissa, the ones who attacked you were the Aberrants. Paul is their informant. He plans to poison Ms. Donna and then coordinate with the Aberrants for another attack on you. I know you might not believe me, but I have evidence. You must stop Paul from poisoning her, or else if anything happens to Ms. Donna, we&rsquo;ll all be in danger.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s face reflected her inner turmoil after reading the message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at Paul in the front seat, finding it hard to believe he could be an informant for the Aberrants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, she saw Donna eagerly picking up a candy, ready to pop it into her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s heart raced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Aunt Donna, wait.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa exclaimed, swiftly snatching the candy from Donna&rsquo;s hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna looked at her in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Clarissa, what&rsquo;s wrong? There are plenty more in the box. Why take mine?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she spoke, Paul glanced back through the rearview mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa hadn&rsquo;t expected to believe Osborne so readily, but she quickly improvised, &ldquo;Aunt Donna, I just read an interesting news article. You should take a look.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, she held out her phone to Donna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna, puzzled, looked at Clarissa&rsquo;s phone and saw Osborne&rsquo;s message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her face immediately showed disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Utter nonsense. He must be crazy.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Donna, what&rsquo;s this news article that got you so upset? May I see it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul asked with a smile from the front.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna was about to respond, but Clarissa stopped her, anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa said, &ldquo;Paul, this is between us women. Aunt Donna, I found this perspective quite intriguing. Even if it&rsquo;s not entirely accurate, we should still be cautious.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa subtly signaled Donna with her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna hesitated, glanced at the candies Paul had prepared, and seeing the plea in Clarissa&rsquo;s eyes, she nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. We should be cautious.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She picked up a candy and pretended to eat it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Captain Paul, the candies are delicious.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul smiled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like them, Ms. Donna.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He then smirked and pressed a button in his pocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa noticed Donna&rsquo;s gesture and felt relieved because she had seen that Donna had only pretended to eat the candy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The candy was still in her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The car continued down the road, soon leaving the city and driving along a desolate route.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa frowned and asked, &ldquo;Paul, this road seems quite deserted. Is this really the way to Skyefall Security Services? Are we safe?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna looked out the window and frowned as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul quickly reassured them, &ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, this is indeed the way to Skyefall Security Services. There are three routes from the Radcliffe Manor to Skyefall Security Services. This one is the shortest, though it&rsquo;s a bit remote. I chose this route to save time. There won&rsquo;t be any problems.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna said, glancing at Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa shook her head slightly, her lips moving without making a sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Donna understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa indicated she hadn&rsquo;t detected any lies from Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just now, Clarissa secretly activated her ability to detect whether Paul&rsquo;s answer was truthful or not, and the result of the detection was the same as always.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul hadn&rsquo;t lied to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was why Donna and Clarissa had always trusted Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No one could lie in front of Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said that guy&rsquo;s crazy. We can&rsquo;t believe a word he says,&rdquo; Donna sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa frowned, unsure how to respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;When we get back, I&rsquo;ll fire him,&rdquo; Donna said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa grew anxious, but before she could speak, the car suddenly braked hard, stopping in the middle of the road. Both women looked up to see that the entire convoy had halted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the same time, Paul&rsquo;s walkie-talkie crackled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Captain, a truck broke down and is blocking the road ahead.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Captain, there&rsquo;s a truck behind us too. We can&rsquo;t turn around.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul responded quickly, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Clarissa, Ms. Donna, please wait in the car. I&rsquo;ll go check the situation.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He opened the door and stepped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as he did, Donna&rsquo;s face changed dramatically, hearing a whistling sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh no. It&rsquo;s a rocket! Clarissa, get down!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna&rsquo;s face twisted with fear as she pulled Clarissa into her arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next moment, with a loud bang, a rocket exploded nearby, flipping Clarissa&rsquo;s car directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Simultaneously, more rockets were speeding towards them.</p><div class="pagination">
