  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stood on the deck of the warship, gazing at the quiet cosmos outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He noticed that Stellar Region M72 simply had very few stars, making it appear dark. In reality, it was filled with small celestial bodies, various planets with diameters of only tens of thousands of miles, or even meteors that couldn't be considered planets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logically, traveling through the vast cosmos, it's hard for a person to collide with other celestial bodies. However, due to the sheer number of small celestial bodies here, Angela often had to maneuver the warship to change direction and avoid collisions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, this was a mid Empyrean Sacredness warship. Even if it collided with these small celestial bodies, it could easily smash them to pieces without taking any damage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha walked up to Osborne, looked at his profile, and asked, "Osborne, what are you looking at?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nothing much. I&rsquo;m just thinking about what to do next."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frenetic Storm Warband is a Second-rate Stellar Exploration Organization. As its leader, Taylor's cultivation level had reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. With Osborne's strength, he definitely couldn't defeat Taylor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with Agatha and Angela's help, he still couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's greatest reliance was Flash, along with the Silver Beetles raised by Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, besides Taylor, Frenetic Storm Warband also had numerous advanced Empyrean Sacredness and mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors. Even if he found Frenetic Storm Warband, rescuing his parents wouldn&rsquo;t be easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. We'll help you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're just here to rescue your parents. Maybe we don't even need to face Frenetic Storm Warband head-on! As long as we can get them out, that's enough! We have the Sublime Concealment Orb, so it shouldn't be too hard."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I hope so!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, their expressions darkened. They instantly shifted their gaze to the side of the battleship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There, a small celestial body with a diameter of ten thousand miles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was desolate, with no signs of life, but just a moment ago, Osborne and Agatha sensed an energy fluctuation there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Something's wrong!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, they saw a massive battleship emerge from the far side of the planet, quickly blocking their battleship's path.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was an Inferior Sacred Artifact battleship!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A flag was hanging above it, bearing a black skull.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They are Space Pirates!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly shouted to Angela, who was piloting the battleship, "Angela, change direction immediately! We don't want to tangle with those Space Pirates. Their battleship is just an Inferior Sacred Artifact, so they can't catch up with us. Just shake them off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She nodded and immediately began maneuvering the battleship to change direction, but at that moment, they were all shocked to see one Inferior Sacred Artifact battleship after another quickly emerging from behind the surrounding small celestial bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each battleship bore a skull flag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were more than twenty such battleships. They seemed to have been hiding behind these celestial bodies for a long time, setting up an ambush. Using the celestial bodies as cover, they managed to remain unnoticed by Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once they entered the ambush, these battleships appeared simultaneously, surrounding them in the center.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, every direction around them was surrounded by at least two or three battleships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face turned extremely cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "We just arrived at Stellar Region M72, yet we've already been targeted by Space Pirates. And we've fallen right into their ambush. Stellar Region M72 is even more chaotic than the rumors!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was not panicked at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Satan's Eye was already activated, quickly scanning the twenty-plus battleships to assess the enemy's situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he felt much more at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately said, "There are a total of twenty-four battleships, all Inferior Sacred Artifacts! Each battleship has about ten people, most of whom are at the primary Empyrean Sacredness cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are twelve warriors who have reached mid Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha and Angela both looked at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, at this moment, those Space Pirates' battleships were still far away from them. In the vast starry sky, even though Agatha and Angela were both Empyrean Sacredness warriors, they could only see a tiny dot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't see the people on the battleships at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the battleships were surrounded by protective shields blocking their view.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne just took one glance at them and clearly saw all the enemies on them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His vision is quite impressive!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Agatha and Angela said nothing, slightly frowning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Over two hundred Empyrean Sacredness warriors?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Among them, twelve have reached mid Empyrean Sacredness? Their strength can be considered Second-rate Power!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They've already surrounded us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela said, "Those twelve mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors are mine. I can handle them! The rest are up to you. Hold on as long as you can! Once I finish my opponents, I'll come to help you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she had also reached mid Empyrean Sacredness, she was just a step away from breaking through to advanced Empyrean Sacredness. As a genius disciple of the Fairy Moon Sect, she was considered a prodigy. She was confident she could handle twelve mid Empyrean Sacredness Space Pirates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, true prodigies would never stoop to becoming Space Pirates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Angela worried that Osborne and Agatha couldn't handle over two hundred primary Empyrean Sacredness Space Pirates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she knew Agatha had just broken through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne was still just an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King. Although, in Angela's view, he could already challenge higher levels and defeat ordinary Empyrean Sacredness warriors, there was no way he and Agatha could take down so many ruthless Empyrean Sacredness pirates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela growled, "Stay on the warship and hold them off. Try not to go out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and Agatha exchanged a glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No need to bother!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmly said, "They're just Space Pirates. If they want to plunder us, that's their misfortune! If I can't even handle these Space Pirates, how can I rescue my parents from the 'Frenetic Storm Warband'?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait until they get close, then we just kill them! Don't waste too much time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes revealed a cold killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no mercy for such Space Pirates. If he killed them all and fed their corpses to the Warfare Ancient Tree, they could still have some value.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already gripped the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Space Pirates' warships had quickly surrounded them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela looked at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why is he so confident? There are over two hundred Empyrean Sacredness pirates and twelve mid-Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, the pirates had surrounded them, leaving her no time to think further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From one of the pirates' warships, twelve men and women in black robes suddenly flew out. Each of them exuded a powerful aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were the twelve mid-Empyrean Sacredness pirates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They stood in the starry sky, surrounding Angela's warship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a cold voice rang out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Listen up! We are the Skull Pirates. You are surrounded! Don't resist pointlessly. We're only after wealth, not lives!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you obediently leave this Mid-grade Sacred Artifact warship, along with all your resources and treasures, we can spare your lives and let you go!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't cooperate, don't blame us for killing you all!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
