  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia spoke up, "What Orlando said before was all just hot air! That young man isn't even a member of the Baxter family; he's the son of a vice-leader from the Falcon Alliance! Orlando was just trying to scare us by using the Baxter family's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He thought he could intimidate us by claiming to be a vice-leader's son, but I didn't buy it&mdash;I knocked him out right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made sense; after all, the Baxter family was a Dukedom Level Power, one of the two major powers in Apocalypse City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the Human Community of Celestara, the Baxter family stood at the pinnacle of strength, while the Radiant Era Syndicate was merely a second-rate force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way the Baxter family would be directly linked to the Radiant Era Syndicate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Falcon Alliance was the real connection between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Baxter family controlled the top-tier power Falcon Alliance, which controlled secondary powers like the Radiant Era Syndicate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, "It's a pity! It'll be tough to find evidence of the Baxter family's betrayal of the Human Community within the Radiant Era Syndicate. Even if we can prove that they've colluded with the Dark Deity Legion, it would only lead us back to the Falcon Alliance. If we go down that road, we might just tip them off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group fell silent, not wanting to interrupt Osborne's train of thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps the key to uncovering the Baxter family's betrayal lies within the Falcon Alliance, that first-rate power. We'll need to tread carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Osborne added, "Let's clean this place up. From now on, this will be our temporary base."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren asked, "My Lord, what should we do with the Radiant Era Syndicate members?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "I could transform them into Blood Clan members, making them obey my commands. That way, we could even keep a low profile for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he glanced at Darren, whose eyes were burning with rage, he quickly dismissed that idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren despised the Radiant Era Syndicate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was their actions that had led to the deaths of the Pioneers of Starlight members. Turning these people into Blood Clan members would be too lenient; Darren wouldn't voice his objections, but he wouldn't feel right about it either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne said, "I'll leave them to you. Get your revenge! Make sure they pay for what they've done! I'll handle the rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's body trembled at those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip and replied, "Thank you, my Lord! I know exactly what to do. Can we bring out my comrades from the Pioneers of Starlight? This was their home, and these people are their enemies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Of course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand to open the portal to Hope Haven, and soon, over five thousand figures emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were all former members of the Pioneers of Starlight, survivors of the ambush from a year ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they had been transformed into Blood Clan members by Osborne, they retained their memories and ways of thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they returned to the Pioneers of Starlight's former base and laid eyes on their enemies, their eyes turned bloodshot with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guys! Let's tear them apart and avenge the Pioneers of Starlight!" Darren growled through clenched teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make them pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't linger, leading Anastasia and the others into the mansion. The scene that was about to unfold would be gruesome; while they were used to such sights, there was nothing pleasant about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, do you think we'll run into trouble for killing the Radiant Era Syndicate members? After all, they're still part of the Human Community. You may know from their memories that they betrayed us, but we lack solid evidence..." Anastasia voiced her concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "It's fine! If we don't take them out, Darren and the others will be restless. As for trouble... Let it come! If it gets too hot, we'll just pack up and move again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne's nonchalance, Anastasia decided not to press the issue further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, the divine power shield surrounding their base was activated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the outside, no one could see what was happening inside, but the chilling screams echoed throughout the night, continuing until dawn broke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren and his team methodically dealt with every member of the Radiant Era Syndicate, ensuring no one was left standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time morning arrived, the base had returned to its usual state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the bloodstains had been meticulously cleaned up by Darren and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his door to find Darren and the others waiting outside, their expressions filled with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, thank you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for giving us the chance to take our revenge! Thank you for allowing us to personally deal with our enemies and avenge our fallen comrades from the Pioneers of Starlight! And thank you for giving us a second chance at life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, we'll be nothing but your blades!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand. "Get up! We're all in this together! You're now Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not just my weapons; you're like my brothers now. So, let's drop the formalities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he added, "Alright, you can all head out for a while, or you can return to Hope Haven if you prefer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darren, come with me! There are some things we need to discuss."</span></p><div class="pagination">
