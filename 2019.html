  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan stared at Osborne and his group, their faces boiling with killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's orders had to be carried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to kill the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings in the arena. Only then could they survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further ado, the hundred Paramount Supreme Clan Supernal Deity Kings launched their attacks, as if afraid Osborne might regret his decision to face them with only eight people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight against a hundred?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was suicide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings, all super geniuses, all with two hands and one head. What made Osborne think eight people could take on a hundred?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings couldn't pull this off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle began without any probing or testing. The hundred Paramount Supreme Clan Supernal Deity Kings immediately unleashed their Divine Ascendance Techniques, their terrifying attacks layering over one another as they engulfed Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and his group, however, remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne even took a few steps back, standing behind Anastasia, Zoe, and the others. He said, "I'll leave these people to you. Finish them quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne clasped his hands behind his back, making it clear he had no intention of joining the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hundred Paramount Supreme Clan Supernal Deity Kings' attacks, their layered Divine Ascendance Techniques, meant nothing to them. During their training, they had faced dozens of Osborne's clones, the coordinated assaults of ten thousand Blood Demon members, and the relentless onslaught of hundreds of thousands, even millions, of Dark Undead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combat experience and teamwork had been honed to an extreme level through such trials. Attacks of this caliber were child's play to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were they all Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But aside from their cultivation level, the seven of them were far superior to the hundred Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses in every other aspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of Divine Body, the Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses were only at Level Seven or Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the seven of them...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All possessed Level Ten Divine Bodies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of power level, the Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses' power sources barely reached Level Eight, while the seven had already reached the mid to late stages of Level Nine, even approaching Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Divine Ascendance Techniques?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others had mastered their Divine Ascendance Techniques even before breaking through to Supernal Deity King. Through countless sparring sessions and adjustments, they refined their techniques to perfectly suit their styles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, while they were only Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings, the gap in strength... was staggering!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For others, it was nearly impossible to challenge opponents of higher ranks after becoming Supernal Deity Kings. But for Anastasia, Zoe, and the others, challenging those above their rank was effortless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could even take on opponents two ranks higher and still stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, when Anastasia, Zoe, and the others made their move, the battle immediately became one-sided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia: Tempest Jinx!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe: Soul Ferrying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila: The Age of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah: The Age of Dark Prosperity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra: Incendio!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce: The Flooding of Mountain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana: The Earth's Ruin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seven of them unleashed their respective Divine Ascendance Techniques, and the arena was instantly plunged into what seemed like an apocalypse. The attacks of the hundred Paramount Supreme Clan Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings were shattered before they could even reach their targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrifying energy surged across the arena, effortlessly shattering the defenses of the hundred first-tier Supernal Deity Kings of the Imperial Clan, and then harvesting their lives...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, Anastasia's Tempest Jinx was the most terrifying. It was inspired by Osborne's Divine Ascendance Technique, Multi-thunder Chainstorm, and focused more on explosive attack power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless bolts of lightning rained down, each capable of reducing a Supernal Deity King of her level to a bloody pulp, leaving no trace of their existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of raw destructive power, Anastasia's Tempest Jinx was even more brutal than Osborne's Multi-thunder Chainstorm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's Soul Ferrying, on the other hand, was more insidious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Invisible soul attacks spread to the enemies, easily devastating their Soul Current Oceans. Some suffered from mind-numbing shocks, leaving them dazed, while others bled from their orifices as their Soul Current Oceans collapsed, leading to instant death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila, Kendra, Hannah, Diana, and Bryce's Divine Ascendance Techniques each had their unique characteristics. Some specialized in offense, others in defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they all shared one common trait...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were overwhelmingly powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the Divine Ascendance Techniques of other Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings, the difference was like heaven and earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the Paramount Supreme Clan Supernal Deity Kings screamed in terror as they fell under the relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap was simply too vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time Anastasia, Zoe, and the others had displayed their strength since breaking through to Supernal Deity King, and it left everyone in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Sanctum of Light, everyone stood up, staring in disbelief at the scene unfolding on the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massacre!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another massacre!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, it was ten thousand Blood Demon members slaughtering ten thousand Deity King Level geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne not even lifting a finger, Anastasia, Zoe, and the others were massacring a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sight left them utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were leaders of major factions within the Human Community, seasoned warriors who had lived for centuries and witnessed countless battles. But they had never seen anything like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings, so the difference in strength should have been minimal. Yet, the result was like the difference between an adult and a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no resistance at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless gasps of shock echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the power of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can they be so strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With strength like this... how can they only be Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings? Even seven Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings couldn't massacre a hundred Paramount Supreme Clan Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings like this! Their strength feels comparable to Ascension Three..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss! Is this what true super geniuses look like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel like any one of these seven could rival the Paramount Supreme Clan's Five Brilliant Scions! Maybe... even surpass them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community wasn't the only one in shock. The Paramount Supreme Clan was equally horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Icy One couldn't maintain his composure. Watching Anastasia, Zoe, and the others slaughter the Paramount Supreme Clan warriors in the arena, his eyes turned bloodshot, and his face filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity King... they've become even more terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The strength they're displaying now is on par with the Paramount Supreme Clan's Five Brilliant Scions! But how? How can these lowly Humans compare to the Paramount Supreme Clan's most elite super geniuses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They all deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's killing intent was at its peak. He knew this battle was lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But compared to the strength displayed by the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, the outcome of a single match no longer mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I needed to consider now... was how to eliminate the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings. I couldn't allow them to continue growing!" thought Icy One.</span></p><div class="pagination">
