  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After merging completely with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, Osborne gained five extraordinarily powerful abilities, which are absolute defense, absolute control, absolute guardianship, absolute forbidden zone, and absolute fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolute defense required him to transform into the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to execute it. Although Osborne had never used it yet, he had mastered it well in theory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolute control, on the other hand, was specifically focused on Blood Golems. It allowed him to transform anyone into his Blood Golem, enhancing their strength using blood energy. In crucial moments, Osborne could absorb their energy to elevate his own tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolute guardianship was a game-changer; it granted him the ability to bestow immortality upon anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By casting this ability, he could duplicate their life essence. Even if they died, Osborne could resurrect them, effectively making them invulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The absolute forbidden zone was the ability he utilized the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within this zone, he could suppress the cultivation level of his enemies drastically. For instance, he could lower the status of someone five ranks higher to only four ranks above him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An opponent four ranks above would be reduced to just two ranks higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those three ranks above him would be brought down to his level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of this ability, Osborne's capacity to challenge opponents above his level had reached epic heights. Coupled with his invincible prowess at his current tier, even foes at Ascension Three would find themselves swiftly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In essence, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity granted him a suite of formidable powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only ability he hadn't yet mastered was the elusive absolute fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced. "Absolute fusion refers to the blending of energies with different attributes! Like combining physical power with divine power, merging soul power with elemental essence, or fusing different elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, merging elemental essence is the simplest route. For instance, I can blend my space elemental essence with dark elemental essence, allowing my attacks to harness both spatial and dark forces, making them remarkably more potent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, merging different attributes is quite a challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only an Empyrean Sacredness warrior can grasp it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ascend from Supernal Deity King to Empyrean Sacredness, the first step is mastering energy fusion to create 'Sacred Power'. It's precisely the difficulty of merging powers and generating Sacred Power that contributes to the scarcity of Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given my rank and current power, I shouldn't be able to merge different attributes, regardless of how gifted I am.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that I've completely merged with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and obtained its super ability&mdash;absolute fusion&mdash;there's hope!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My other abilities aren't progressing for the moment, so it's time to see if I can fuse spatial and dark powers together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined, Osborne decided to put his plan into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the eighth day of his seclusion, and as Alfreda continued her own training, he chose to try merging the forces of space and darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He selected these two powers because he felt more adept with them compared to lightning, making the fusion significantly easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this fusion succeeds, I'll attain 'Sacred Power' ahead of schedule! While my Sacred Power won't stack up to that of an Empyrean Sacredness warrior, my overall strength will surely multiply!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Osborne closed his eyes, focusing intently as he prepared for the fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't force a merge between his space and dark elemental essence right away; instead, he focused intently on grasping the super ability granted by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity&mdash;absolute fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low hum resonated through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, he felt a shadowy image of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity materialize within him. As Osborne delved deeper into understanding absolute fusion, the Lotus' apparition became increasingly defined, almost as if it were coming back to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew this wasn't the real Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity&mdash;it was something different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Ah, the Fusion Vessel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To perform absolute fusion, I must first create a Fusion Vessel within my body for the merging process! Once I form this vessel, I can channel different energy essence into it, and the vessel will automatically merge them into a single force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's that simple?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's excitement bubbled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, I need to stabilize this fusion vessel! Once it's firmly established, I can implant various energy essence into it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a thrill at how straightforward the process seemed; he had expected mastering absolute fusion to be exceedingly difficult, his confidence wavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Truly, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is an incredible gift! Without it, merging energies to create Sacred Power would be an uphill battle, even if I were to reach Ascension Eight or Nine. But now, because of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I finally have the chance to fuse energies. Fusion Vessel, stabilize completely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dim image of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity within him solidified, becoming strikingly clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, two crimson lotuses unfurled within the vessel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rush of energy surged through Osborne's body, and he felt a wave of joy washing over him as he confirmed the vessel's stability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two blooming lotuses served as the foundation for the Fusion Vessel, allowing it to contain one type of energy essence each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant he could only merge two different energy essence at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as his power grew, he knew more lotuses would bloom, expanding the vessel's capacity and enabling the fusion of even more energy types.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For now, I'm restricted to two different essence..." Osborne murmured, pondering which two to choose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, he had planned on merging the space elemental essence with the dark elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, he wanted to reconsider his options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Right now, I could merge space elemental essence, dark elemental essence, or even thunder elemental essence! I also have divine power essence, physical essence, and soul power essence! Heck, even my Satan's Eye essence and Death's Stare essence could be on the table!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Death's Stare essence can go. It's just too weak for what I need right now&mdash;wasting energy on it would be pointless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Satan's Eye, that's my foundation. I can't risk losing that or facing unexpected consequences. And physical and soul power essence could easily backfire on me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I must pick two essence that will boost my strength without shaking the foundations I've built."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit torn, slightly regretting that his Fusion Vessel had only two bases, limiting him to combining just two essence for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. I'll stick with fusing two elemental essence. It's the best choice for a significant boost while keeping things safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a firm decision made, Osborne chose to go back to his original plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would merge space elemental essence with dark elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's get this fusion started!" he declared, ready for the transformation ahead.</span></p><div class="pagination">
