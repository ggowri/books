  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After King Ainsworth finished speaking in a cold tone, the flames on his body grew even more fearsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The palace tiles beneath his feet melted in an instant into scorching, crimson lava, and even the vines hanging from the dome were instantly charred to ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present wore expressions of shock and dismay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrifying flames spread throughout the palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah snorted coldly. He waved his hand, and more emerald vines cascaded down from the dome, forming a shield wall that protected both Sherwood and Alfreda behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The searing fire licked at the shield of entwined vines, crackling as it burned, but it could not completely consume them, and neither Sherwood nor Alfreda was harmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ainsworth frowned as he took in the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"War?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah spoke first, his tone even, "King Ainsworth, do not be so quick to threaten war! Although we Nature Elves are the weakest of the nine great Elf houses in Elf City, we are not afraid to fight anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must remember that Elf City might manage without the Fire Elves, but it cannot do without the Nature Elves! If you truly wage war, I will not be afraid of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ainsworth's face grew even darker at those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uriah, what do you mean by that? Are you trying to threaten me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah replied icily, "It has always been your Fire Kingdom that has threatened our Nature Kingdom! I am merely reminding you that while you may use the superior power of the Fire Kingdom to oppress us, to actually declare war..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sneer of contempt curled on Uriah's lips. "You could go and ask the Ethereal Elven Temple! Ask the Shadow Kingdom, and see if they would allow you to wage war on the Nature Elves! You might even ask the Elven Mother Tree whether it permits you to do so."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Ainsworth clenched his fists, his face darkening further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then shifted the topic. "Declaring war was merely an impulsive threat. Let us put that aside. But your daughter Alfreda bullying my daughter Monica is a fact. Now, tell me, how do you propose to resolve this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you cannot offer me a satisfactory answer, then do not blame me for being rough. After all, those who strike must pay the price! Otherwise, if Sherwood were to suffer any harm at someone else's hands in the future, do not come complaining to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Sherwood's face paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah, too, wore a grim expression as he ground his teeth and said, "Speak now. What exactly must be done to settle this matter? You must not go too far, for you know full well how this happened! Had Princess Monica not provoked the situation, my daughter would never have struck out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But since she did, she must accept punishment. However, if your demands are too extreme, I will never agree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sherwood was momentarily stunned by his father's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ainsworth snorted dismissively and said coolly, "Of course! After all, Princess Alfreda is also a member of the royal family. I would never be overly harsh. Once a mistake is made, a punishment should suffice to set things right! But this is the second time she has committed the same offense, so the severity of the punishment must be increased!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My proposal is this. In front of the rulers of all the Elf Kingdoms and the members of the Ethereal Elven Temple, your daughter must publicly apologize to my daughter Monica, then endure fifty lashes, and finally be imprisoned in the Dungeon of Stillness for three years so that she may deeply reflect on her misdeeds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surely, that is not too excessive, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the faces of everyone present darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah immediately stood up, his face full of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To force my daughter to apologize before everyone, to suffer fifty lashes, and to be locked away in the Dungeon of Stillness for three years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is utterly unreasonable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should rather go to war!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah was furious. Out of the three conditions, only the fifty lashes might be acceptable; the rest were completely out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An apology was simply unacceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would never force his daughter to beg forgiveness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nor could he ever allow her to be confined in the Dungeon of Stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No normal person could endure three years locked away and then emerge sane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would never let his daughter be subjected to such a fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would rather go to war!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>King Ainsworth, seeing Uriah's vehement reaction, was not surprised at all. It was as if he had expected this outcome all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke coldly, "It seems you do not accept my proposal! In that case, I have two more options. You may choose one. If you refuse all three, then war it is! Elf City cannot do without the Nature Elves, but it can do without the Nature Kingdom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ainsworth's eyes gleamed with threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah frowned and, after a moment, snorted, "Then tell me your other two proposals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure. My second proposal is: exile your daughter from Elf City! She shall not return for fifty years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah's eyes blazed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exile? Fifty years?! On what grounds? This is her home!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She has made a mistake; she must pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ainsworth's flames roared wildly as he faced Uriah, not budging in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, I am willing to be exiled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alfreda bit her lip and declared, "</span><span>J</span><span>ust leaving Elf City? I am not afraid! I don't care how dangerous it is. I am not a child anymore! With my abilities, I can survive outside, and I will thrive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda glared defiantly at King Ainsworth, as if daring him to intimidate her further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah scolded, "Fifty years without entering Elf City means that for those fifty years, you will not absorb the power of the Elven Mother Tree! That will limit your achievements for life. Just like me, you will be stuck at Supernal Deity King Level with no hope of a breakthrough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Alfreda's face changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could speak, Uriah continued addressing King Ainsworth, "Now, tell us your third proposal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! The third proposal is very simple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your daughter must go to Umbra Earth herself. She must find ten Flame Gold Crystals and present them to my daughter as penance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you do not accept this proposal, then war it is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ainsworth's expression turned resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah could not help but frown. "Ten Flame Gold Crystals? You really have the nerve to say that! The newly discovered Umbra Earth is extremely dangerous, and so far, no one has even managed to obtain one. How can one expect to find ten there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is far too difficult...impossibly so!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah's brow furrowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ainsworth sneered, "If it were not challenging at all, how could Princess Alfreda learn her lesson? How would she ever correct her mistakes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my final condition! If you refuse all my proposals, then we shall..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before King Ainsworth could finish, Alfreda bit her lip and declared through gritted teeth, "I accept!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will go to Umbra Earth and find ten Flame Gold Crystals!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
