  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's face turned pale, and the more he thought about it, the more he found this world terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had the time in the entire solar system been distorted and accelerated by billions of times?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How great a power was this? What level of power was it? Osborne was afraid that such a being could kill him with just a thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the God of Night...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she alone sacrifice all the gods and bury all the beings in the entire world?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night buried the Age of Gods!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of terrifying power was this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's forehead was covered with cold sweat, and he was unwilling to believe that this was the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that's definitely not right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he recalled the words that Isa had once said, he suddenly found a loophole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne was imprisoned in the Augustine family's dungeon, Isa had visited him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she pretended to be old and told him the second version of the myth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa mentioned that there was once the Age of Gods on the earth, a magnificent time when numerous powerful gods coexisted and jointly governed this planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Age of Gods was very powerful, and people today could not imagine it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even in that era, the gods also had enemies. Evil gods from other planets crossed the stars, seeking to enslave all beings in the universe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gods of the earth were unwilling to be enslaved and had no choice but to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the war between gods broke out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this war between gods, it was ultimately the God of Night and the God of Death in the Court of the Sun who worked together to defeat the invading evil gods!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's accounts of these two mythological stories indeed had different plots. While both stories feature the same character, the God of Night, their actions were completely opposite to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the first myth, the God of Night buried the gods and billions of creatures on the earth with her own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the second mythological story, the God of Night joined forces with the God of Death to defeat the evil gods from other planets and save the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, which story is true? Which story is false?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or are they all fake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had some doubts and found Isa unreliable. Sometimes, her words were unclear, making it difficult to distinguish between truth and falsehood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know that Isa had not actually told him the second version of the myth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was said by the residual soul of the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because the two mythological stories happened to echo the same character, Osborne thought that she was secretly teasing him, so he called Isa's name. As a result, he really called her to the Augustine family's dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne naturally thought that the mythological story was also told by Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, he frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing he could be sure of now was that there was indeed a problem with the </span><span>time in the solar system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he believed that the Godfather would not lie to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thinking about, Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather suddenly spoke. He looked at Osborne's expression, which kept changing. It was as if he was caught in some mystery, so the Godfather couldn't help but interrupt Osborne's thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne came back to his senses and looked at the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Perhaps, the Godfather can give me the answer! After all, he is the underground king of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, the Class S Supreme Overlord, and the most powerful person in the entire world. With his experience, he may know more of the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne told the Godfather the two mythological stories that Isa had told him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure she said that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "She did say that, but she also admitted that these were fabricated mythological stories. Perhaps they are all false. Isa might have learned about the distortion of time in the solar system through some channels, so she conveniently created such mythological stories. However, the contradiction between these two stories is evident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather took a deep breath, and his face became serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ignored Osborne's explanation and murmured, "She actually said that when the God of Time in the Court of the Sun awakens to a certain degree, the time of the solar system will return to normal. At that time... the gods will reappear?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't that mean that all of us have the opportunity to become gods?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, don't you believe her words? Isa just likes to play around. She's like a little kid, sometimes bossy, sometimes naughty, and always saying some inexplicable things. You don't have to take it seriously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said this, he recalled her lovely face, and a tender expression appeared on his own face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather came back to his senses and looked at Osborne with strange eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that how you view her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he smiled faintly, "Isn't it? By the way, since we are talking about her, I also happen to wonder what is your relationship with her? Why did you ask Isa to help distribute the rewards for the first successor test, and why did you let her go to my side?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the Godfather curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather, embarrassed, said, "She and I... Since she didn't tell you about this, I can't tell you either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, you have to be nice to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather's expression grew serious as he took a deep breath and said, "Osborne, the bottom line is that you are fortunate to know her! This world is not as simple as you think, and I cannot even see it clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must strive to become stronger, not only to find your parents but also for yourself!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
