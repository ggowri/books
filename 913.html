  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's face went pale in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face then darkened. "You're not just doing this to avenge your daughter, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast a glance at Scarlett, who was still visibly injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin chuckled lightly. "Avenge her? That's just part of the deal. More importantly, by eliminating Osborne, we can gauge Night Witch's reaction and figure out the true power of the Court of the Sun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go on," Rumen said, curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin said, "Osborne has a deep connection with Night Witch. Our plan is to entangle Night Witch while you take care of Osborne. If Night Witch fails to retaliate, it means the Court of the Sun isn't as formidable as they seem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's face tightened. "You want me to kill Osborne? That's impossible! What if Night Witch comes after me? Her strength is no joke&mdash;if she calls in Shadow Killer, I won't stand a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin remained unfazed. "Then how about you divert Night Witch's attention while we handle Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen shook his head vehemently. "I don't have that kind of confidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin scoffed, saying, "You're unwilling to engage with Night Witch and refuse to kill Osborne. Don't you want to avenge your kids? You let Osborne disgrace them, and you just plan to sit back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a scornful look shared between Sin and Crimson, Rumen felt the weight of their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Marlon and Ebony, seeing their injuries and the fiery rage in their gazes. His fists clenched at his sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin continued, "Don't forget&mdash;you're Helios' grandson! He's the strongest on Blue Planet. Even Shadow Killer can't outmatch your grandfather. If you do take down Osborne, the Court of the Sun won't dare retaliate, out of respect for Helios."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen continued to frown, maintaining his composure. "No, I can't involve him. It's been ages since he fought. I won't drag him into this mess! Until I'm absolutely sure, I refuse to take on the Court of the Sun!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin and Crimson were speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, Sin said, "If you're not willing to take matters into your own hands, then we'll have to find someone else to assist us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And who would that be?" Rumen inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin replied coldly. "Gerardo. Given his history with the Augustine family, he'd jump at the chance to eliminate Osborne. Moreover, he's unaware of Osborne's relationship with the Night Witch. The catch? He's currently preoccupied and can't handle it himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, we can reach out to Gerardo's third disciple, Bradley. He's having a rough time after Osborne humiliated and injured him in the arena. Trust me; he'll be more than eager to take down Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that point, you just need to weaken Osborne enough for Bradley to finish him off. If Night Witch seeks revenge, it'll be directed at Bradley&mdash;Gerardo's the one she'll go after, not us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Court of the Sun, as powerful as they are, won't risk coming after the Eityreia Organization or the League of Divine Descent without a solid excuse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's eyes lit up at this new plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gears were turning in his mind as he considered the possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon spoke up, his voice strained but resolute, "Dad, let's do this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne must die! Even if I can't be the one to pull the trigger, I need to witness his end with my own eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can't see Osborne fall, I won't find peace! I'll never be able to break through Class S if this anger doesn't subside&mdash;it'll ruin my future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon's passionate words struck Rumen like a bolt from the blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here was his most promising son, someone he envisioned quickly surpassing him, potentially even breaking into the top ranks of the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, Marlon had suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon's defeat wasn't just a loss; it was a deep humiliation that crushed Marlon's confidence and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marlon couldn't get revenge, his future would be shattered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought burning in his mind, Rumen gritted his teeth. "Fine! I'm in. I can take action, but I'll only restrain the Augustine family. At most, I'll help injure Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't be the one to kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin and Crimson exchanged amused glances, their laughter ringing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, that's more than enough! This operation will let us gauge Night Witch's strength and get a feel for the Court of the Sun's true power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows, soon enough, we might just bring the Court crashing down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without the global agreements, the world will spiral back into chaos&mdash;exactly the kind of world we crave, right? Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sin and Crimson laughed, Rumen joined in, a glimmer of determination in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wish we have a fruitful partnership!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio swiftly laid out their plans. On the other side, Osborne was entirely unaware of what was brewing behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood, gazing at the Draco Star Wristlet, furrowing his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reward for the Seventh Inheritance Trial... do I have to find Mr. Wesson Augustine? Has the Godfather already handed over the prize to him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast a glance at Wesson, who was on the viewing platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson smiled and nodded, gesturing for Osborne to come over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, excitement bubbling within him as he hurried to catch up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was eager to discover what the reward for completing the Seventh Inheritance Trial would entail.</span></p><div class="pagination">
