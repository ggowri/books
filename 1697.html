  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After rallying the Blood Demon members, Osborne decided to take a stroll around the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This space wasn't particularly large, stretching only about six miles in diameter. It had been hastily set up for temporary use, le</span><span>aving</span><span> it feeling somewhat rough around the edges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's still some time left. Why not spruce this place up a bit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, I can expand its boundaries! I have a hundred Sanctuary Gems, and theoretically, each one can create a Dimensional Microcosm of six miles in diameter. But that special white Sanctuary Gem? It can create a massive Microcosm spanning six thousand miles!" Osborne mused, his excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, he summoned the hundred Sanctuary Gems, one of which glimmered, radiating a dazzling white light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These gems were once part of a necklace given to Mila by her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was thanks to these Sanctuary Gems that Mila and Divine Shadow managed to survive the invasion by Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't yet know who Mila's parents were, but he was certain they were Deity King warriors</span><span>, </span><span>no ordinary ones, either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Lord Malevolence descended upon Celestara, Mila's parents were among the first to confront him, which spoke volumes about their formidable strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they didn't quite measure up to the seven top-tier Deity Kings of the Human Community, they were not far off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Sanctuary Gems were a treasured collection of Mila's parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in Celestara, they were incredibly rare, especially the white ones. Many Deity King warriors had sought to purchase it from Mila's parents, only to be turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's use this top-tier Sanctuary Gem! A six-thousand-mile Dimensional Microcosm will be more than enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne declared, ready to get to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Constructing a Dimensional Microcosm with a Sanctuary Gem was a breeze for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his space elemental essence already at Level Seven, the task was well within his capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Seven was a whole different ballgame compared to Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, he harnessed the power of space to carve out a Dimensional Microcosm of six thousand miles, stabilizing it with the Sanctuary Gem at its core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like a creation myth unfolding before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Osborne's command, a brand-new world began to take shape</span><span>, </span><span>a vivid tapestry of mountains, rivers, lakes, oceans, jungles, grasslands, swamps, and canyons appeared within the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He aimed to craft this space into something exquisite and welcoming, a sanctuary where one could feel not just safe but also comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, everything was complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dimensional Microcosm resembled a beautiful painting, and Osborne couldn't help but feel satisfied with his work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew that wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy in this new realm was too thin, hardly suitable for prolonged cultivation. However, that wasn't a problem for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous Dimensional Microcosm had been rich with energy, a gift from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, a cosmic treasure of unimaginable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could merge this new Dimensional Microcosm with the previous one, it would transform into a sacred ground for cultivation, rich enough in energy to rival Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before that, Osborne decided to move some things in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He designated a central area within the Dimensional Microcosm as a mining zone, like a treasure vault, to store his precious items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began transferring countless mid-grade Essence Crystals, top-grade Essence Crystals, and even Ultimate Essence Crystals and Celestial Crystals from the Dimensional Space into his newly created sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer quantity of resources was staggering, resembling a mountain of treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy radiating from them intensified the Dimensional Microcosm's vitality countless times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't finished yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he moved a withered, decayed segment of the root into the Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This root contained more energy than millions of Celestial Crystals, and its purity and quality were unmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With its addition, the energy in the Dimensional Microcosm surged to yet another level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Divine Peak Nine would pale in comparison to this newfound sanctuary! Living here would be so enriching that one could experience rapid advancement in their realm without even needing to cultivate actively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne brought in the humanoid stone figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was peculiar, and he hadn't yet found the time to study it, he had no doubt it was a treasure of immense value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once all this was done, Osborne fused the two Dimensional Microcosms together,</span><span> which</span><span> caus</span><span>ed</span><span> the surrounding energy to become even more vibrant and potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This place is truly a paradise for cultivation!" he exclaimed in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To top it all off, Osborne relocated the Infinite Devouring Eyes from beneath Divine Peak Nine into the Dimensional Microcosm. The ability to absorb energy from this rich environment would accelerate his advancement even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a satisfied smile, Osborne declared, "From now on, this place shall be known as Hope Haven!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
