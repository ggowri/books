  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had always preferred straightforward opponents. The moment Broderick launched his attack, Osborne drew back the string of his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Sacred Power arrows materialized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time around, he wasn't going to mess around. Satan's Eye might not be able to spot Broderick's weak points right off the bat, so he decided to go all-out with brute force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He channeled a powerful Divine Ascendance Technique into the Sacred Power arrow, and its might skyrocketed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That terrifying arrow obliterated Broderick's attack in a split second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Broderick could even wrap his head around what was happening, the arrow slammed into his defensive Sacred Artifact with a deafening bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy shockwave tore through the artifact and smashed into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick was sent flying through the air like a ragdoll, crashing hard against the glacier. A trickle of blood oozed from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned and in disbelief, Broderick stared at Osborne, unable to wrap his mind around the fact that he'd been taken down by a single arrow. He tried to struggle to his feet, but his body refused to cooperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Benson stood there, his eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd figured Osborne would beat Broderick, but he never dreamed it'd be such a cakewalk. Broderick hadn't even been able to put up a fight against that arrow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So that's how it is. He wasn't even breaking a sweat when we went head-to-head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wry smile spread across Benson's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne put him in his place, Benson figured he'd sized the guy up.</span><br><span>This Osborne, he's the only one with a snowball's chance in hell of taking on Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was pretty darn sure he'd given Osborne all the credit Osborne was due.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Benson realized he'd seriously undersold Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Taking down Broderick with a single shot? That's downright terrifying. Agatha can't be any stronger than this, can she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Frost Peak City was enveloped in an eerie silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne had defeated Benson, the crowd had been chattering away, coming up with all sorts of theories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd assumed Benson's injuries had thrown off his game and hadn't seen much of a difference in their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after watching Osborne take out Broderick with one arrow, all the noise died down. Everyone was left speechless, gazing at Osborne in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, out of the blue, the power rankings that had been floating in the air for seven days suddenly disappeared!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe the Zephyr State officials finally woke up and realized that ranking Osborne 108th was a total joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was way better to scrap the whole list than to keep getting egg on their faces every time Osborne trounced a top-ranked fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already taken down Conrad, ranked 15th, Lincoln, ranked 8th, and now Benson, ranked 4th, and Broderick, ranked 3rd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And each win was easier than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How on earth could a guy with that kind of power only be ranked 108?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a real knee-slapper!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, right after Osborne beat Broderick, the Zephyr State officials quickly axed the old power rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, a new set of rankings popped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha still held the top dog position, but the second spot had a new occupant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace, who'd been second before, had dropped to third, and the new number two was Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick and Benson now took the 4th and 5th spots respectively, while Lincoln landed at 6th.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy was ranked 47th, and Clara ended up at 100th.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the new power rankings showed up, the crowd started yapping away again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This new ranking is a whole lot more on the money than the last one! But can Osborne really outshine Horace? That's still up in the air."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Osborne's win over Broderick was something else, but remember, Horace managed to give Agatha's Phoenix Cry Bone Flute a run for its money! Sure, he lost, but it was to Agatha, the top dog. Do you really think Osborne can take down Horace?" another person chipped in, their voice dripping with doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe it!" a voice called out from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Horace's Frost-invoking Canvas? I seriously doubt Osborne can stand up to that! In front of Horace, he wouldn't even have a chance to pull out his bow; he'd be turned into an ice block in a flash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because Agatha can deal with the Frost-invoking Canvas doesn't mean Osborne can!" someone else added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're telling me! I still reckon Horace is the stronger one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the point of arguing? Sooner or later, they'll go head-to-head, and then we'll see who's the real deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After taking down Benson and Broderick, Osborne's points shot up by over a million! He's sitting pretty at 9.3 million now! If he beats Horace next, he'll be breathing down Agatha's neck, breaking the ten-million mark!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, hitting ten million points?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Man, it's been ages since someone managed that in a state duel. And now, aside from Agatha, could Osborne actually pull it off this year?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just think about it! Two folks with over ten million points going toe-to-toe for the championship? I'm already itching to see Osborne take on Horace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be honest, I'm rooting for Osborne! I mean, Horace has already lost to Agatha. If Osborne can't even beat Horace, he doesn't deserve to face Agatha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agatha will stay on top, no doubt about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was abuzz with excitement and wild speculations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, deep inside the Arctic Maw Chasm, there was a momentary lull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace was licking his wounds from Agatha's earlier onslaught and was in the process of recuperating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha, on the contrary, was fine-tuning her state, gearing up for the grand finale. She seemed dead-set on the idea that a grueling battle was ahead and was determined to be in top-notch form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, though, was in no rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a few hours still left before the state duel wrapped up, he had already racked up 9.3 million points, just about 1.5 million short of Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he had to do was take down Horace and Agatha, and he'd easily outshine her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was hell-bent on snatching the state duel championship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed through his badge that Agatha and Horace were in close proximity. After a bit of pondering, he decided to track them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But first, he fancied catching another scrap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It just so happened that Lincoln was about to square off against Benson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln had just come to, with his injuries all healed up. As a member of the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan, he not only got tougher with every fight but also had some crazy recovery abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he found out that while he was out cold, Osborne had beaten both Benson and Broderick, he felt a pang of regret for missing those epic bouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Lincoln threw down the gauntlet at Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson took the challenge, and the fight kicked off. Osborne, curious about Lincoln's fighting skills, decided to stick around and watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight was a real doozy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Lincoln lost, but he'd pushed Benson to the limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Benson's fusion of three powers and his superior Sacred Power, Lincoln would've walked away the winner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lincoln's Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan bloodline is seriously a goldmine of potential!" Osborne muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he made up his mind to go after Horace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beating Horace would send his score soaring past ten million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he'd finally get to face Agatha for the championship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Broderick, Benson, and Lincoln caught wind that Osborne was gunning for a showdown with Horace, their eyes sparkled with excitement. They exchanged a knowing look and wordlessly decided to tag along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne spotted Horace up ahead.</span></p><div class="pagination">
