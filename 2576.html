  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, only Clara and Yvonne remained on the stage. They unleashed intense fighting spirit and Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They seemed evenly matched!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation once again left everyone stunned. Yvonne's performance seemed perfectly normal to them, as the previous battles of the eight princes and princesses had already shown just how terrifying the strength of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family descendants truly was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they couldn't understand how Clara, ranked last in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, displayed strength that was in no way inferior to Yvonne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought, "Doesn't that make the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings a joke?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Who was it spreading rumors before that Clara only stood out in the state duel and zone duel because of her luck and the even greater luck of Osborne's help, allowing her to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Who said that with her true strength, she wasn't qualified to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is ridiculous!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Clara isn't qualified, then the five people she easily defeated and Princess Yvonne, who now faces her with a serious expression, would be even less qualified!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She hid her strength!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone came to the same conclusion and didn't think Clara's strength had suddenly skyrocketed in a short time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This match just got exciting!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Finally, an outstanding warrior can challenge the princes and princesses! Otherwise, this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel would just be their exhibition match, which would be way too boring!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The match is finally getting exciting! If Princess Yvonne loses, it&rsquo;ll be even more interesting! These princes and princesses of the Royal Family were way too confident before, acting like the top nine spots were already theirs and everyone else was worthless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If she loses, the Royal Family will probably feel so embarrassed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from the Royal Family, the spectators also included numerous generals and officials of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, as well as many influential figures. Some of them were also looking forward to seeing the princes and princesses of the Royal Family defeated by ordinary people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, quite a few people had already started supporting Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad, I think Clara still has a hard time winning!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clara might have a chance, but whether she can win depends on how far she can go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the arena, despite Yvonne unleashing her full momentum and Sacred Power, she couldn't suppress Clara at all. Instantly, her expression grew more serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew she had encountered a formidable opponent!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a princess of the Royal Family, Yvonne didn't care about the other contestants before, confident she could defeat any ordinary participant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, now, she felt the pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I won't lose!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne thought, "Although I am the weakest among the nine competing princes and princesses, I will never lose to any ordinary contestant. I absolutely cannot disgrace the Royal Family! Absolutely not!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, my father, the entire Royal Family, and all the big figures of the Glorious Divine Kingdom are present!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, I absolutely can't lose!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For the glory of the Royal Family, I must win!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Yvonne frantically encouraged herself in her heart. Under such circumstances, her incredibly powerful Sacred Power suddenly became even stronger and more ferocious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gripped her massive battle blade tightly and launched an attack immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You will be the loser!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A loud boom echoed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne didn&rsquo;t want to lose. Moreover, she knew that on this arena, since contestants couldn&rsquo;t use Defensive Sacred Artifacts, their attacks were stronger than their defenses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When everyone's strength is about the same, whoever strikes first gains the advantage!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To uphold the Royal Family's dignity and honor, Yvonne chose to strike first. Terrifying blade energy surged out, instantly growing immense, as if it could shatter the entire Royal Sepulcher with one slash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, the massive arena's edge had an extremely powerful protective shield. Otherwise, this slash would have absolutely shattered the entire Royal Sepulcher into pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this terrifying slash left many contestants flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all knew Yvonne was getting serious!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among these contestants, few were confident they could block this slash. Even if they could, they'd likely get injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Mason's expression also turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amid the rumbling noise, the blade energy swiftly reached Clara. At this moment, she finally took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her previous battles, she easily defeated five opponents. They were very strong. If it were the old her, she would have been easily beaten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, the situation has completely turned around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This gave Clara immense confidence. Even when Yvonne launched the first attack, Clara showed no fear or worry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Osborne said, I'm stronger than her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then I must be stronger than her! The winner will definitely be me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara suddenly swung her jet-black iron chain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a thunderous boom, the iron chain struck the massive blade energy, instantly generating a terrifying shockwave that spread wildly in all directions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Yvonne's incredibly terrifying blade energy began to shatter inch by inch, like fragments of glass.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation left Yvonne stunned. She had used the unique combat technique of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family, fully unleashing the combat power of the Legendary Sacred Artifact. This was almost a full-force strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this was blocked by Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power within Clara's iron chain was incredibly terrifying. It blocked Yvonne's full-force strike, shattered it, and even continued to attack her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne bit her lip and kept swinging her battle blade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blades of energy erupted, slashing at Clara's iron chain with a deafening sound, instantly sending the chain flying backward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne showed an excited expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, Clara gently waved her hand, and the recoiling iron chain came at Yvonne even faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wherever her iron chain passed, the void seemed to crack with tiny fissures, shattering all of Yvonne's blade energy before heavily striking her massive battle blade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, her battle blade flew out, and her wrist started bleeding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne felt shocked but remained calm. She immediately took out another Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a princess of the Royal Family, she naturally lacked neither Legendary Sacred Artifacts nor even Supreme Sacred Artifacts. As long as she could wield them, she could have as many as she wanted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne roared, "Get lost!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she unleashed her power again, striking Clara's iron chain with a deep, muffled sound, but it failed to completely break the chain. Instead, Clara's iron chain seemed to come alive, deftly circling around her body once before quickly tightening.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Clara's pitch-black iron chain tightly wrapped around Yvonne's body. No matter how much power Yvonne unleashed, she couldn't break free.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Clara's iron chain tightened, Yvonne's face grew increasingly pale and more shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Yvonne's Sacred Power abruptly vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was subdued!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara breathed a sigh of relief and revealed an incredibly radiant smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You lost!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am the top of the group!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
