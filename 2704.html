  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's cultivation level skyrocketed, leaving Isa and Clarissa utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They even started to feel a bit worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Rivera, Mrs. Rivera, is this normal? The Elven Mother Tree doesn&rsquo;t seem that strong, so why is the effect so remarkable after Alfreda fused with it?" Isa asked curiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah smiled and explained, "You think the Elven Mother Tree isn't strong because it's always been in its weakest state! If that weren't the case, Isidore wouldn't have dared to fuse with the Elven Mother Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If the Elven Mother Tree weren't weak, the three of us wouldn't have been able to force a fusion! In fact, the Elven Mother Tree's power is incredibly strong..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Elf City was built relying on the Elven Mother Tree! In the past, many warriors tried to seize Elf City and the Elven Mother Tree, but they all failed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In its normal state, the Elven Mother Tree can easily handle even warriors from the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness! And that's not even its peak state!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Elven Mother Tree was injured and has never fully recovered..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But after Alfreda fused with the Elven Mother Tree, she could fundamentally heal its wounds. Although it can't restore the Elven Mother Tree to its peak state, it can recover part of its power, and this power will also be transferred to Alfreda, continuously boosting her cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After listening to Uriah's explanation, Isa and Clarissa breathed a sigh of relief."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as Alfreda is fine, that's all that matters. As for Alfreda's cultivation level and strength, the higher, the better. Even if she surpasses them, they won't feel jealous."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then just wait patiently..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isa decided to keep waiting."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But just then, an unexpected event occurred."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A terrifying loud noise echoed. The massive protective shield covering Elf City shattered abruptly like glass."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clarissa let out a scream, fell to the ground, and blood trickled from the corner of her mouth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That protective shield was set up by her using the Legendary Defensive Sacred Artifact to prevent the people of Elf City from escaping."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now that the protective shield was broken, her Legendary Defensive Sacred Artifact was covered with countless cracks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This force backfired on Clarissa, injuring her instantly and causing blood to flow from the corner of her mouth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She looked up in shock."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She is an advanced Empyrean Sacredness. The protective shield set up with the Legendary Defensive Sacred Artifact is difficult even for an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection to break, yet it was destroyed in an instant and even backfired on her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She realized that the person who broke the protective shield was extremely powerful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, a figure appeared above Elf City, looking down below and finally locking onto Isa and Clarissa, with a cold smile at the corner of his mouth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Finally found you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The man laughed excitedly and instantly landed in front of Isa and Clarissa."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Naomi, why are you here?" Isa said coldly, her face serious as she stood in front of Clarissa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>None of them expected the person to be Naomi.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Isa a bit flustered. She never expected Naomi to appear here. Naomi is one of the strongest in the Royal Family, and after emerging from the Skyfall Casket, her cultivation level had already reached Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Isa's cultivation level was only Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was no match for Naomi!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sensing the icy killing intent in Naomi's eyes, Isa knew things had gotten troublesome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right, it's me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi glanced around, slightly disappointed to see no one else. However, he didn't rush to make a move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Aren't you curious how I found you? Back at Fairy Moon Sect, I saw you and thought you were beautiful, so I paid special attention and remembered your aura!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not long ago, I sensed your aura and thought someone from Fairy Moon Sect was with you, so I rushed over immediately..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Didn't expect it to be just you two!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But this works too. As long as I capture you two, I can naturally find out Fairy Moon Sect's hiding place from you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, will you surrender, or do you want to struggle a bit?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi mockingly looked at Isa and Clarissa, not taking them seriously at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa and Clarissa, one is Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, the other just advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Naomi's strength, she could easily handle them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa angrily clenched her teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to get the Fairy Moon Sect's hiding place out of us? Keep dreaming!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi sneered, "Looks like you want to struggle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, I'll defeat you first and then slowly force the answers out of you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Naomi prepared to attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But suddenly, she noticed Alfreda protected by the shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sensing Alfreda's aura rapidly rising, she was a bit surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her aura is skyrocketing? So fast! What treasure does she have? Didn't expect an unexpected gain!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whatever the treasure is, you have no right to own it. It's all mine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Naomi swung her fist toward Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa shouted, "Don't hurt Alfreda!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She instantly stood in front of Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa spat blood and fell in front of Alfreda. The protective shield guarding Alfreda shattered, leaving Alfreda exposed to Naomi.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power gap between Isa and Naomi was too great!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa was only at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection; she was no match for Naomi. It was impressive she could withstand even one strike from Naomi.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Naomi was surprised at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sneered and said, "Trying to stop me? Now I'm even more curious about what treasures she has! Get out of my way, or I'll kill you all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Naomi walked toward Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa clenched her teeth, struggled to get up, and stood in front of Alfreda again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gritted her teeth and said, "Naomi, I advise you to leave immediately!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've already contacted Osborne, he'll be here soon! By then, you're done for!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi sneered with disdain upon hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Trying to scare me with Osborne? Ridiculous! Even if he can come, it takes time! Before he arrives, I'll have killed you all! Get out of my way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi struck out again, sending Isa flying. Isa fell to the ground, coughing up blood violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi reached out to grab Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa was powerless to stop it and could only watch as Naomi grabbed Alfreda's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi sneered and said, "You can die now! The treasure on you is mine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Naomi tried to strike Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!" Uriah shouted anxiously, "We can't let her hurt Alfreda, or the fusion between Alfreda and the Elven Mother Tree will have problems! Stop her..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Isa's expression became even more terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after enduring two attacks from Naomi, she was seriously injured and couldn't stop her in time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Clarissa took action at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clarissa launched an all-out attack, trying to stop Naomi from harming Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Naomi just let out a cold snort and casually waved her hand, sending Clarissa flying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gap in strength between them was too great!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A bunch of trash trying to stop me? Ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Naomi punched Alfreda in the chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone could no longer stop it, their eyes filled with despair.</span></p><div class="pagination">
