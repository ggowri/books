  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just five days to go until the state duel, the Zephyr State authorities rolled out their official power rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The list featured a thousand participants who were set to take part in the state duel, ranked based on the strength they'd shown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, since they hadn't actually faced off against each other yet, the rankings were a bit subjective. However, the state duel power rankings could still give some idea about the strength of the competitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the list came out, it landed in the hands of every major power, fueling even more heated discussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Number One in the State Duel Power Ranking&mdash;Agatha Woolley!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Agatha hails from the First-rate Power, Resurgent Throne Palace. She's one of their top disciples, holding a high position even within the palace. She has the blood of the ancient phoenix running through her veins. The phoenix is a legendary divine beast, also known as the immortal bird and the king of all birds, capable of rising from its own ashes. She entered the Frosty River City duel as an independent contestant and ended up steamrolling all her opponents to clinch the Frosty River City championship!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Word on the street is that Agatha has already fused three powers. Her Sacred Power is off the charts, and she's mastered the Sacred Artifact, the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute, to perfection. When she plays the melody, it'll put anyone who listens into a trance. She's a force to be reckoned with all on her own. Even though the state duel is a wild territory battle and she doesn't have a strong team by her side, she's bound to shine and take the state duel championship&mdash;all she needs is a bit of luck!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Coming in at Number Two on the State Duel Power Ranking is Horace Steinbeck!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Horace also hails from the First-rate Power, Chilling Nether Palace. He entered the Cloudia City duel as an independent contestant and won without a shadow of a doubt. He's also mastered a Sacred Artifact, the Frost-invoking Canvas, to the fullest. When he waves it, it can freeze thousands of miles in an instant, making him virtually unbeatable. He's a one-man wrecking crew!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Rumor has it that he, too, has fused three powers, making his strength on par with Agatha's. It'll take a direct showdown to see who's the stronger of the two.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Either way, there's no question that Horace will make a name for himself in the state duel. He and Agatha are destined to become powerhouses across the Glorious Divine Kingdom...]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Number Three on the State Duel Power Ranking is Broderick Swinburne!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Broderick hails from the First-rate Power, Fiery Volcanic Isle...]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Number Four on the State Duel Power Ranking is Benson Smollett!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Number Five...]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the large training ground of the Mystic Sirius Sect, an Elder hung the state duel power rankings up high so that the disciples could take a look and have a chat about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, hurry up and check! See where Osborne ranks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given Osborne's strength, he must be in the top fifty! Maybe he even has a chance to be in the top thirty! After all, Osborne easily beat Leroy, Clara, and the others in the Tempest Fortress City duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, where on earth is he..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect quickly scanned the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't among the top ten. The disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect thought it was to be expected. After all, almost all the top-ten contenders hailed from the three First-rate Powers&mdash;the Chilling Nether Palace, the Resurgent Throne Palace, and the Fiery Volcanic Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading about the powers of those people on the list, the members of the Mystic Sirius Sect were left slack-jawed and deeply shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their strength was simply off the charts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them had not only blended three distinct forces together but also had complete mastery of Sacred Artifacts. They wield these artifacts with such finesse that it's like they were born to use them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there were those who were a force to be reckoned with all on their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were like self-contained armies, carrying the legacy of various ancient and powerful bloodlines in their veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne really doesn't stand a chance against these guys! He's light-years behind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect held Osborne in high regard, they had to face the facts. The top ten on the state duel power rankings were absolute powerhouses, with abilities so formidable that Osborne couldn't hold a candle to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they turned their attention to the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's name was still missing. They didn't find it too surprising, though. The top twenty were also extraordinary beings. Each of them had awakened their Sacred Power ahead of time and managed to wield a Sacred Artifact in city duels without losing control or suffering a backlash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne must be in the top thirty, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They mumbled to themselves and kept scanning down the list. However, Osborne's name was still nowhere to be seen, and many started to furrow their brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still no sign of him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kept their eyes glued to the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 31st to 40th place&mdash;no Osborne in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 41st to 50th place&mdash;still nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 51st to 60th place&mdash;there was still no sign of him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, the disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect were in an uproar, their faces flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is going on? How can Osborne not even make it into the top sixty? What's the criteria for this ranking? I could understand if he wasn't in the top thirty, but not even the top sixty? That's just crazy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do the Zephyr State officials have any idea what they're doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Are they dissing our Mystic Sirius Sect? Are they looking down on Tempest Fortress City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a single contestant from Tempest Fortress City has made it onto the list so far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep looking! I'm gonna see how low those Zephyr State officials are gonna rank Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 61st to 70th place&mdash;zilch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 71st to 80th place&mdash;nada!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 81st to 90th place&mdash;still nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 91st to 100th place&mdash;zip!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, a contestant from Tempest Fortress City finally showed up on the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Leroy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[State Duel Power Ranking: 96th Place&mdash;Leroy!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Leroy comes from the Second-rate Power Azure Haven Academy. Although she was defeated by Osborne and Clara in the Tempest Fortress City duel, it was only because she lost control when using the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance. But in the end, she turned misfortune into a blessing and mastered the Inferno Drake Lance. Her current strength has surpassed Osborne and Clara. If she has enough allies in the state duel, she has a chance to enter the top hundred, or even aim for the top fifty!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect immediately started shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the deal? Leroy is just someone Osborne defeated. Why is her ranking higher than Osborne's? Osborne is the champion of Tempest Fortress City. How come he's not even in the top hundred?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they looking down on Tempest Fortress City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was incredibly angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, they spotted Osborne's name on the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[State Duel Power Ranking: 108th Place&mdash;Osborne!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explanation read: [Osborne is the champion of Tempest Fortress City. But Tempest Fortress City isn't that strong overall. Plus, Osborne's cultivation is only at the Ascension Eight level, the lowest among the thousand participants in the state duel. Sure, he has Sacred Power, but he's never shown off a Sacred Artifact. His attack power is solid, yet his combat techniques are rather basic. That's why we've ranked him 108th.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Given that he hails from the under-powered Mystic Sirius Sect, he won't have strong allies in the state duel. It's next to impossible for him to do well. Reaching the top hundred would be a stretch and would need a ton of luck!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Osborne's ranking and this evaluation, the whole Mystic Sirius Sect was ticked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was little they could do about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assessment made by the Zephyr State officials was fairly objective. After some careful thought, they found they had no grounds for argument and could only feel powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Those ranked above Osborne do seem to outmatch him, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Take Leroy, for example. If she fully masters the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance, could Osborne still come out on top in a rematch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It'd be an uphill battle!</span></p><div class="pagination">
