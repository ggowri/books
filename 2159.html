  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!" Anastasia exclaimed, her voice a mix of disbelief and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected that, just when the defenses of Peaks City were about to crumble, infighting would erupt within the Human Alliance. Samson, the leader of the Glacial Bear Crew, was not only planning to surrender to the Paramount Supreme Clan but also to capture her and the others as offerings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Samson made his move, Anastasia was caught off guard, unprepared for the assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was violently thrown back, her body crashing against the ground. The difference in their cultivation levels was staggering&mdash;she was merely an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, while he was an Ascension Five. No amount of talent could bridge that gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spilled from her lips as Anastasia hit the ground, her complexion paling rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around her, the other members of the Human Alliance looked on in shock, their expressions frozen in disbelief, showing no intention of stopping Samson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's face darkened to a stormy shade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, Mila, and the others rushed forward, panic etched on their faces as they sought to check on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Samson merely chuckled coldly. "You little brats should join her on the ground!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hand yourselves over to the Paramount Supreme Clan, and let's dismantle the defenses of Peaks City. They'll accept our surrender without question!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he launched another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, Mila, Kendra, and Hannah were sent flying, blood spraying from their mouths as they too hit the ground, their faces ghostly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samson reveled in the chaos, a wicked grin spreading across his face. "Listen up, everyone! The Paramount Supreme Clan only wants the God of Light and the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community! We're nothing but a nuisance to them! If we hand over the Seven Young Deity Kings and surrender Peaks City, they'll definitely accept our capitulation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who wants to live, come with me now! Let's drop the defenses and negotiate with the Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he reached out toward Anastasia and the others, something strange happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, a peculiar wave of energy rippled through the air, freezing everything around them in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Human Alliance stood there, expressions locked in shock, unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Anastasia seemed unaffected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared in astonishment, her eyes widening as she noticed a tall, elegant figure striding toward her, exuding an aura of cold disdain and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she saw that person, shock flashed across Anastasia's face, and then she frowned. "Ophelia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Ophelia let out a cold snort. "Anastasia, fancy meeting you again! But I don't go by Ophelia anymore. Don't call me that name 'cause I freaking hate it! Call me God of Time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia struggled to get up. She turned her head to look at the frozen people and the still-standing time around her, her heart filled with sheer horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your power has recovered to such an extent? God of Time?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn!" Anastasia gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It never crossed her mind that her brother Osborne's wife was actually the reincarnation of the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she woke up, she hadn't seen Ophelia again. Little did Anastasia expect to run into Ophelia here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Time, why did you save me?" Anastasia asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time gave a cold laugh. "Save you? You're daydreaming! I just don't want you to die at someone else's hands. I want you to die by mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia looked utterly surprised and frowned deeply. "You're gonna kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? As far as I remember, I've never done anything to offend you, have I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time's expression twisted into something grotesque. "Because you're Osborne's sister! My reincarnation, Ophelia, was married to your brother! It's the most humiliating experience of my life! And you, as someone who knows the truth, must die! Not just you&mdash;Osborne too! I want to erase every trace of that shameful memory! Everything connected to him must be wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's face hardened at her words. "Ophelia, you've lost your mind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seriously consider marrying my brother a disgrace? Look into your heart&mdash;did Osborne ever treat you poorly after marrying you? Did he wrong you in any way? Did he make you sad, hurt, or suffer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! He didn't!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, he cherished you, even enduring humiliation for your sake! But how did you repay him? You looked down on him for his humble beginnings, belittled him for not making enough money, and ultimately divorced him, leaving him with nothing! When he refused, you even had your bodyguards beat him up! You have no right to say any of this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To my brother, marrying you was the worst chapter of his life! And when he finally grew strong, while you were still weak and hadn't regained your memories, he chose not to kill you! But now, Ophelia, you've regained your strength and want to kill my brother? You want to eliminate everything connected to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What gives you the right?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's icy gaze bore into God of Time, filled with nothing but anger and disdain, devoid of any fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time, however, was furious, her aura radiating a terrifying intent to kill. "Shut your mouth! I told you, I'm not Ophelia&mdash;I'm the God of Time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at Anastasia, her voice dripping with venom. "Do you really think I won't kill you right here? I'm the God of Time! Why should Osborne have the right to marry my reincarnation? How dare he tarnish my body? If it weren't for him, the God of Night wouldn't be avoiding me like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all Osborne's fault! He ruined my life! If it weren't for him, I would have realized my dreams and married the God of Night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes burned with rage and wildness as she continued, "So, Osborne must die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything related to him must be erased! Only then will my body be cleansed! Only then will the God of Night see me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it has to be this way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that means I have to kill you with my own hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she took a step closer to Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's expression was one of contempt. "I don't care if you're the God of Time or Ophelia! You've truly lost your way! I almost feel sorry for you, because this vessel of yours has no soul left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! Kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill me, and you'll die too! My brother will surely avenge me! Go ahead, try it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's words cut through the air, and God of Time's fury only intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Osborne seeking revenge for you? Please! I'll admit he has talent, but does he really think he can take me on? Dream on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Threatening me with that useless brother of yours?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you say that? I'll kill you right now, and soon enough, I'll send Osborne to hell to join you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, God of Time raised her hand, aiming a crushing blow at Anastasia's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia lifted her chin defiantly, her eyes devoid of fear, filled instead with cold resolve and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only fueled God of Time's rage further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a surge of speed, God of Time brought her hand down with deadly intent, aiming straight for Anastasia's skull.</span></p><div class="pagination">
