  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I finally got the thousandth Demon Dragon's Breath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne used the Heaven Arrow to kill the last Illusionary Heavenly Demon at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, reached out to grab a Demon Dragon's Breath, and his expression was incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's really too hard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, he finally did it. On the fifteenth day of entering the Phantomagic Realm, he collected a thousand Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Demon Dragon's Breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A thousand Demon Dragon's Breaths can condense into a drop of Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne placed all the Demon Dragon's Breaths together. They quickly intertwined and fused, eventually forming a drop of Dragon Elixir radiating multicolored brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A word instantly flashed through his mind: perfect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the Perfect Dragon Elixir, far stronger than the Legendary Dragon Elixir. Just a trace of its aura emanating made Osborne feel as if he saw countless stars twinkling, from the beginning of the Big Bang to their destruction...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is Enlightenment State!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly stored the Perfect Dragon Elixir into the jadeflare vial and sealed it with Sacred Power. Only after ensuring no aura leaked out did he breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Just a trace of its aura almost pushed me into Enlightenment State! The effect of this Perfect Dragon Elixir is too powerful! If I take it directly, I might need a long time to fully absorb it and wake up from the Enlightenment State."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now is not the time for me to use it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While there's still time, I need to collect more Perfect Dragon Elixirs! Such treasures are probably rare even in the deeper parts of the universe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne immediately took action again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what puzzled him was that after wandering around for a long time, he didn't encounter a single Illusionary Heavenly Demon. All the Illusionary Heavenly Demons in this independent illusionary space had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Could it be that I've already killed them all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply. He originally wanted to seize the time to collect more Perfect Dragon Elixirs. However, he couldn't find a single Illusionary Heavenly Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, he suddenly felt the entire starry sky shaking violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, cracks began to appear in his vision, as if the heavens and earth were about to split apart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Like glass shattering, more and more cracks appeared. Suddenly, at a certain moment, with a crisp sound, everything broke apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne found himself back in darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he sensed some distinct auras not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation didn't make him nervous; instead, it filled him with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "That independent illusionary space has shattered!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I&rsquo;ve finally escaped from that independent illusionary space and returned to the Phantomagic Realm!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he looked into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There, Osborne sensed the presence of several warriors. At this moment, his Satan's Eye activated, instantly revealing those people clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's actually them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in Osborne's eyes, Azael and his elder were standing cautiously in the Phantomagic Realm, carefully observing their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and let Flash take the form of a warhorse. After transforming back to his previous appearance, he mounted Flash and approached them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who's there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Osborne didn't hide his presence, Azael and his elder sensed him as soon as he approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they saw it was Osborne, they heaved a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So it's you, Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael quickly greeted Osborne with utmost politeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Osborne single-handedly and effortlessly killed several advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors from Cobalt Island. Azael had long been intimidated by his strength and dared not be impolite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked behind Osborne but didn't see Angela or Agatha, and immediately felt a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, have you also entered the Phantomagic Realm? With your strength, I believe you must have obtained quite a bit of Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile and nodded. "My harvest is decent! What about you? What have you experienced before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to know if he was the only one trapped in an independent illusionary space or if it was the same for everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael answered honestly, "As soon as we entered the Phantomagic Realm, we found ourselves in an incredibly realistic illusionary space. There were many meteorite-like celestial bodies. As soon as we got close, they would distort and transform into enormous terrifying creatures&mdash;those were the Illusionary Heavenly Demons!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as we kill an Illusionary Heavenly Demon, we can obtain a wisp of Demon Dragon's Breath. Once we gather a thousand wisps, we can condense them into a Dragon Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Our strength is average, so our harvest is also average. We only got a few dozen drops of Low-grade Dragon Elixir and a dozen drops of Mid-grade Dragon Elixir, but no Top-grade Dragon Elixir. We simply can't handle those swarms of Illusionary Heavenly Demons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It seems that, like me, everyone was trapped in an independent illusionary space for the first half month, only breaking free just now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Azael and his elder's harvest was indeed average.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They only have a few dozen drops of Low-grade Dragon Elixir and a dozen drops of Mid-grade Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's smile was radiant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael and his elder's strength was not weak either. One of them was an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior, five were mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors, and Azael was a primary Empyrean Sacredness warrior. Compared to Osborne's harvest, theirs was far inferior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne obtained a total of 200 drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir, 200 drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir, and one drop of Perfect Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He actually also had one drop of Mid-grade Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it was eaten by Primordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The value of one drop of Top-grade Dragon Elixir is probably greater than all of Azael and his elders' harvest combined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne didn't show off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, he would get into trouble. If people knew about his harvest, many would probably be unable to resist their greed and make a move against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, he exchanged a few more words with Azael before bidding farewell and leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone had emerged from their individual illusionary spaces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could finally go look for the Frenetic Storm Warband. He had already waited fifteen days. At this point, he couldn't wait any longer. After all, the Phantomagic Realm was vast, and finding someone wasn't easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fifteen days, Phantomagic Realm will disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within fifteen days, Osborne is determined to find the Frenetic Storm Warband and take full control of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He rode on Flash's back, swiftly searching through Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until he completely disappeared that Azael and his elders breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luckily, he didn't seize our Dragon Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, with his strength, if he wanted to take it from us, we wouldn't stand a chance. To survive, we'd have no choice but to hand over the Dragon Elixir!" Azael said fearfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others nodded as well, but the leading elder, the advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior, coldly said, "He didn't take our Dragon Elixir probably because he doesn't value our harvest! Didn't you sense the intense Demon Dragon's Breath on him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He definitely has a considerable amount of Top-grade Dragon Elixir, maybe even Legendary Dragon Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder's words shocked Azael and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Augustine has a considerable amount of Top-grade Dragon Elixir, maybe even Legendary Dragon Elixir? How is that possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To obtain Legendary Dragon Elixir, he would need to kill a thousand advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons! No matter how strong he is, he's just one person. How could he possibly kill so many advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder said calmly, "I also think it's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But he indeed carries an incredibly powerful Demon Dragon's Breath! Just wait. Someone will definitely make a move on him to seize his Dragon Elixir!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
