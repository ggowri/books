  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a minute later, Ninety-third was back on his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his organs had completely healed, and a surge of vitality coursed through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bone marrow was working madly, replenishing the blood he'd lost, and color was rapidly returning to his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Can you believe this? The Crystal of Life can actually pull off recovery from such grave injuries? If it could restore a crushed skull as well, wouldn't that be like having a lesser version of the Light of Redemption? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Imagine possessing the Crystal of Life&mdash;could that make one practically immortal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, he knew that was far from certain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smashed head would still mean certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne could somehow use the Light of Redemption to revive someone whose skull had been shattered, they'd merely be recovering a body; the person's consciousness and memories would be lost forever&mdash;like an entirely different individual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear he wouldn't risk smashing Ninety-third's head just to test the limits of the Crystal of Life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it could mend a crushed heart, that was already more than enough for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he felt the energy from the Crystal of Life, Osborne noted that a third of it had already been consumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So, while it can bring someone back from a crushed heart, it takes much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The amount of vitality in this Crystal is at least ten times that of Ninety-third, meaning it could theoretically revive him ten times! But to merely restore his heart, it costs a whopping twenty percent of the Crystal's vitality!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, that's more than enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With satisfaction, he glanced at Ninety-third and tossed him the divine artifact dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne declared, "Ninety-third, your bravery truly impresses me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This top-grade divine artifact dagger is now yours as a reward! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, I appoint you as the leader of the fifth squad of the Blood Demon Vanguard, overseeing twenty members. I trust you won't let me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ninety-third stood there, shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clutched the top-grade divine artifact dagger tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a top-grade dagger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most Class S warriors only have Ordinary divine artifacts, and only a few powerful Class S warriors could use Premium items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a top-grade divine artifact was reserved for the elite among elites!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Osborne was giving it to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, he was made leader of the fifth squad!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Ninety-third's excitement was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly bowed to Osborne. "Mr. Augustine, you can count on me! I won't disappoint you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the other ninety-nine members of the Blood Demon Vanguard watched with a mix of envy and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes glimmered green as they looked at Ninety-third.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had simply taken a couple of stabs to the heart&mdash;albeit with no risk to his life&mdash;and now he had claimed a top-grade divine artifact dagger and the title of squad leader!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only they had known that all it took was a little courage to seize such a golden opportunity! They would've fought tooth and nail for a chance like that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon Vanguard was divided into five combat squads, each with its own leader responsible for twenty members. They initially planned to take a break before diving back into the competition for the remaining leader positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Ninety-third already secured as the leader of the fifth combat squad, they were left scrapping for the remaining four spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they not envy Ninety-third?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and addressed the gathered warriors, "There's no need for envy. Each of you will soon possess a divine artifact! If you show enough strength, it's not impossible that each of you could have a top-grade divine artifact in the near future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, step forward and receive your Crystal of Life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, you've all seen what the Crystal of Life can do. This is your lifeline, so keep it close at all times during battle! I don't want any of you dying on my watch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne began distributing the crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from the hundred members of the Blood Demon Vanguard, every ordinary member of Blood Demon would receive a Crystal of Life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those from the Draco Armed Services Branch, as well as all individuals within the Augustine family with a strength of Class A or above, would be granted one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for those below Class A, they'd be left out, as only those at Class A and above could absorb the vitality from the crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger the individual, the faster and more effectively they could absorb the healing energy, allowing for quicker recovery after injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, nearly all 10,000 Crystals of Life had been handed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne kept a few hundred in reserve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had the Light of Redemption, which had superior healing capabilities, it required a significant cooldown period between uses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having the crystals on hand provided more safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the storage area was filled with another 20,000 crystals ready for replenishment whenever necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thought struck him. "Now, I wonder if the Crystal of Life can help Grandpa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he made his way to the room where Sebastian lay. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian had been severely injured and had slipped into a coma after exhausting himself in battle. His vitality was dwindling with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope this works..." Osborne murmured as he gently placed a Crystal of Life on </span><span>Sebastian's chest, activating its healing energy.</span></p><div class="pagination">
