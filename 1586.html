  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman was livid. The moment he heard Donald had been taken to the Wild Flame Army's medical center, he rushed over without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He already knew the basics of what had happened, but seeing Donald's injuries firsthand made his fury impossible to contain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who did this?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice boomed through the medical center, sending a chill through everyone present. No one, regardless of rank, dared to breathe too loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the rage of a peak Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Murray, a lower-level Deity Overlord himself, felt his body tense under the suffocating pressure. Still, he kept his composure, remembering Osborne's plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray put on a frustrated expression, hesitating just enough to make it clear he had something to say but was reluctant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman's sharp eyes immediately caught on. He turned to Murray, his gaze like a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You! What happened, Murray? I trusted you to protect Donald, and this is the result? How could you be so incompetent? Now, tell me&mdash;who did this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman's voice was like ice, cutting through the tense silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray hesitated, glancing at Donald before replying. "General, it's not that I didn't try... but the person who attacked us was far too powerful. I couldn't even put up a fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?!" Herman's frown deepened, his tone growing even sharper. "Did you see who it was?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray's face faltered, and he hesitated again, as if unsure whether to speak. "I... I don't dare say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman's rage boiled over. "You don't dare? What is that supposed to mean? Are you protecting someone? Speak now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald, who had been lying on the bed, groaned and struggled to sit up. His pale face twisted in pain, but he waved the medical staff away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Father, don't blame Uncle Murray. He's not trying to protect anyone&mdash;it's just that the man who attacked us has a complicated background. Saying it outright might bring you trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald's weak voice was filled with caution, and his expression carried a hint of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman's eyes narrowed. Sensing there was more to the story, he motioned for everyone to leave. Once the room was empty, he turned back to Donald, his tone soft but firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Donald, just tell me who it was. You're my only son, and I won't let anyone get away with this. No matter who they are or what their background is, I'll make them pay for what they did to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald hesitated, biting his lip. "But, Father... I don't want to cause trouble for you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman's face softened with a mix of affection and fury. He gently patted Donald's head. "Son, we don't pick fights, but we don't back down from them either. If I can't stand up for my own son, how can I show my face in Wild Flame City? No matter who it is, they'll pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I can't handle it, the Saxton family will! And if that's not enough, the Aether Hawks Clan will step in. And if even they can't, I'll take it straight to Lord Malevolence himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rest assured, Donald&mdash;I'll get you justice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald's face brightened slightly, and he nodded. "I knew you'd stand by me, Father. Since you say so, I'm not scared anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a deep breath before continuing. "The one who attacked me... it was Laird Borden from the Fero Tiger Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman's expression turned deadly cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Laird Borden? From the Fero Tiger Clan?" His voice was low, but the menace behind it was unmistakable. "He dares? He might be a general in the City Guard, but I'm a general in the Wild Flame Army. How dare he lay a hand on my son!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald nodded quickly. "Father, I saw him clearly. We even got footage of it. Everyone with me saw it too&mdash;there's no mistake, it was him. They'll testify if needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And why did it happen? Just because I accidentally bumped into him in an alley. He didn't let me explain, just flew into a rage and attacked us. Left us like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald's voice trembled slightly, and his pale face made him look even more pitiful. "Father... he even threatened me. Said if he ever saw me again, he'd beat me worse. I'm scared..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman's heart twisted at his son's words. Grinding his teeth, he snarled, "Laird! That bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He placed a reassuring hand on Donald's shoulder. "Don't worry, son. Laird Borden is nothing to fear. Show me the footage&mdash;if it's really him, I'll make him regret ever crossing you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald handed over the footage, and Herman's eyes darkened as he watched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It only took a moment for him to confirm it. The video clearly showed Laird beating and humiliating Donald, then threatening him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Laird!" Herman roared, his fury shaking the room. "You think you can beat my son like this and get away with it? If I don't make you pay, I'm not Herman Saxton!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
