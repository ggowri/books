  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Athena frowned, her reluctance evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long ago, she had received unsettling news&mdash;the highest commander of the Wild Flame Army, Deity King warrior Angelo, was personally assembling a task force to escort several brigadier-level miners into Divine Peak Nine for an exploration of the Celestial Crystal mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their objective? The Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison and Athena were both required to join Angelo's team, a demand she found particularly irksome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dangers of Divine Peak Nine weighed heavily on her mind. Even as a mid-stage Deity Overlord, she felt there was little to no safety to be found there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under ordinary circumstances, she wouldn't even dream of approaching that place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sending Osborne in her stead had been her way of steering him toward peril.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, it was different&mdash;this was Angelo making the request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As both a Deity King warrior and the vice commander of the Wild Flame Army, his influence was undeniable, and he was also a prominent figure from the Royston family, one of the strongest clans of the Demonic Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With all that in mind, Athena knew she couldn't refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This realization left a bitter taste in her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had orchestrated Osborne's mission, only to find herself caught in a similar trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like karma's coming back to bite me," she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison spoke calmly, breaking her thoughts, "We have to go, Athena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Athena, you don't need to worry too much. Vice Commander Angelo Royston is, after all, a Deity King warrior. With him in our corner, our safety is more or less guaranteed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, Osborne and Diana will set out ahead of us. They'll be scouting for us, which means if danger lurks out there, they'll face it first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you know what? This is actually a great opportunity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The glint in Edison's eyes was sharp and calculating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Athena furrowed her brows, confused. "Opportunity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uncle Edison, I really don't get it. Why does Vice Commander Angelo Royston insist on personally leading this expedition into Divine Peak Nine? And why go after Celestial Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's a risky venture, and everyone he's gathered comes from the Demonic Dragon Clan, Soaring Lion Clan, and Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's his motivation?" She shook her head, puzzled by the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison smiled, clearly amused by her curiosity, "If you want to know, I'll tell you. Are you familiar with the Bowman family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Bowman family?" Athena echoed, her interest piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she gasped, realization dawning, "Wait, are you talking about the Paramount Supreme Clan, the Bowman family? The one that ranks near the top among all clans?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison nodded. "Exactly that family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Currently, Aldrich Bowman, their Deity King warrior, is in Wild Flame City, accompanied by several elite members of the Bowman family. They're staying at the Royston family's place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Athena's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are they doing in Wild Flame City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Investigating the cause of Tobey's death," Edison replied casually. Athena exclaimed, her heart racing, "Tobey? You mean Tobey, Aldrich's son, the genius of the Paramount Supreme Clan? He died near Wild Flame City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison said, "Yes. He was found dead close to the Royston family's Essence Crystal mining area, along with Myron and Sara from the Royston family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Athena gasped, the weight of this news hitting her hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tobey, a talent from the Paramount Supreme Clan, was killed nearby? Who would dare do such a thing? That's practically asking for trouble! The wrath of the Bowman family could wipe out Wild Flame City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison nodded. "That's true! But the perpetrator was skilled and covered up their tracks well. Even the Bowman family has yet to identify the killer. They have their suspicions but lack solid evidence, so they can't act just yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Suspicions? Who are they suspecting?" Athena pressed, eager for more information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison continued, his tone steady, "Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know why Tobey was in Wild Flame City? He had been defeated earlier by a mysterious woman. He didn't take kindly to that and sought revenge. That woman is rumored to be a super talent from the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, the Bowman family is suspicious of the Mystic Feather Clan's involvement. If they confirm that Tobey's killer is one of them, I assure you, they won't hesitate to wipe out every trace of the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City. The Mystic Feather Clan is in deep trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A smirk appeared on Edison's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Athena's eyes widened, shock coursing through her, but her brow quickly furrowed in confusion. "Uncle Edison, even if the Bowman family is targeting the Mystic Feather Clan, what's that got to do with us going to Divine Peak Nine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison replied, his demeanor unflappable, "Of course it's relevant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Among Aldrich's entourage is a young man named Alfred Bowman. He's the heir to the Bowman family and is currently at the peak of Deity Overlord. He's pushing to break into the Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once he succeeds, he's a shoe-in to take over as the head of the Bowman family. To make that breakthrough, he needs Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Our mission to mine Celestial Crystals at Divine Peak Nine is aimed at giving him what he needs to ascend. That way, he owes us a favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we can get on Alfred's good side, we could also gain favor with the Paramount Supreme Clan's Bowman family, which would be a huge boon for our own Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's why we absolutely must secure those Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
