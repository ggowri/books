  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne really wanted to turn around and go back to his room. If he had known this would happen, he would have rather stayed in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it would be impolite to go back now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only pretend to be calm, nodded and said, "Okay, I just want to stroll around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, they walked out of the suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they walked out, Osborne perceived that there was a person sneaking outside their suite, as if trying to eavesdrop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door was suddenly pushed inward, and the spy staggered and almost fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his rapid reaction, he held her immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spy was Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Kendra stood firm, she saw Osborne and Yulissa coming out. She was immediately embarrassed but quickly returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She chuckled and said, "Osborne, I came to see you. To not disturb your sleep, I just listened to whether you have woken up or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, really?" He looked at Kendra suspiciously. It was so weird for a pretty lady like her to eavesdrop on his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't say much because he could feel that Kendra showed no hostility towards him. Otherwise, Satan's Eye would have given him a warning long ago. Moreover, even if Kendra was really against him, she was not able to carry out her evil plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra's arrival actually helped Osborne get rid of the embarrassment of being alone with Yulissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you come here for?" He asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra said with a serious face, "Osborne, I came here to thank you for saving me last night. I went back and thought about it all night and felt that a simple thank you could not express my gratitude, so I thought..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she glanced at Yulissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa seemed wary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to thank him with yourself?" Yulissa blurted out. "No way! Osborne doesn't need that kind of appreciation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned as soon as she finished talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra was also a little shocked, but soon, her pretty face turned red. "What, what are you talking about? I have never said that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, why are you so opposed? He is your brother, not your boyfriend. Even if I do that, it has nothing to do with you, right?" After saying that, Kendra actually hugged the other arm of his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her words seemed to have irritated Yulissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she blushed a little, she still said loudly, "So, you do want to thank him with yourself! You have planned this long ago to seduce him, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm his sister, and I'm responsible to protect him from women like you whose identity is still unknown! You might plot against him!" She added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plot against him? What are you talking about?" Kendra argued back loudly. "I just wanted to say that I made some delicious food for Osborne to have a taste! You're the one who slandered me at first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Yulissa suddenly felt embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, stop!" Osborne felt his head buzzing, and at this moment, he missed Clarissa very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was the best and would never make such a fuss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two stop arguing, okay? It's just a misunderstanding! Well, I'm hungry too, so why not bring the food you made for me, Kendra."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stopped the two from arguing any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, both of them stopped fighting, but they still glared at each other in dissatisfaction. They each held one of Osborne's arms, as if it was a competition, and no one was willing to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their breasts were pressed tightly against Osborne's arms, making Osborne feel both painful and pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the VIP restaurant was on the 16th floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they walked near the restaurant, but Osborne was stunned for a moment. He finally walked in after making up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the restaurant, Osborne saw two people he didn't want to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia and Evelyn were there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne never expected that he would see his ex-wife and Evelyn, who were supposed to be in Mayby City, on the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he immediately calmed down and treated them as strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia and Evelyn were also staring at him in a daze at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They did not expect to meet Osborne here. In fact, they had been looking for Osborne on the ship for a day, hoping to run into him by chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, their wish didn't come true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, they finally succeeded in meeting him by chance. But seeing Yulissa and Kendra beside Osborne holding his arms, Ophelia realized their relationship with Osborne seemed extremely close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly lost her courage to say hello to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Yulissa and Kendra, she turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from their outstanding appearance, they might even overshadow Clarissa. Now, they hugged Osborne's arms respectively as if fighting for his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is the relationship between them?" Ophelia turned paler and paler as she thought of this question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled bitterly and whispered in a low voice, "I thought that since Osborne lost Clarissa, my chance had come, and I could win him back! I can give up my dignity and everything I have as long as he can forgive me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now I realize how ridiculous I am!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After losing Clarissa, he has another two stunning women...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evelyn, do I still have a chance?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
