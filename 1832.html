  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive divine power barrier loomed over Hudson Valley like a colossal eggshell, enveloping the entire area in a protective cocoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its scale was even more impressive than the defenses surrounding Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the barrier lay what resembled a small city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While ordinary folks couldn't see what was happening within, Osborne had no such limitations; his Satan's Eye pierced through the barrier, revealing the bustling activity of the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he saw next left him utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hudson Valley stretched about 30 miles long and 12 miles wide, filled with various buildings, gardens, and estates, all contributing to its picturesque charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the most striking feature was a vast open space at the center of the valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne witnessed a spectacle that resembled a military exercise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tens of thousands of people were training, their voices echoing with shouts of "Kill!" and "Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were at least 500 thousand warriors clad in the Hudson family's battle gear, divided into two sides, launching ferocious attacks against one another as if they were engaged in a full-scale war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And these warriors were no ordinary fighters; they were all Celestial Deity level and above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least one-fifth were Deity Overlord warriors, and the number of Deity King warriors easily exceeded 10 thousand, all battling it out in midair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this... a civil war within the Hudson family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's initial thought was that they were engaged in an internal power struggle. However, after observing for a moment, he realized he was mistaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't fighting for control; they were simply training!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! Is this the might of a Dukedom Level Power? The Hudson family must have a population of around three million, and they can field an army of 500 thousand&mdash;all Celestial Deity level or higher! Over 100 thousand are Deity Overlords, and more than 10 thousand are Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least a thousand of those are peak Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was genuinely taken aback by the sheer strength of the Dukedom Level Power. Even if this wasn't the full extent of the Hudson family's power, what he was witnessing was already enough to send chills down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder the Human Community in the West Zone can hold off the relentless attacks from the Dark Deity Legion for so long, thanks to the Sanctum of Light and twenty Dukedom Level Powers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The power of Dukedom Level factions is truly terrifying! But if Darren is right, the Hudson family's strength has fallen behind the Baxter family, putting them at the bottom among the top ten families in the Human Community," he muttered, feeling a mix of disbelief and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To think that the Hudson family, with such formidable strength, ranked at the bottom of the Dukedom Level Powers! What must the other Dukedom Level Powers be like?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, here they were, training like madmen in Hudson Valley!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every soldier in the Hudson family army appeared to be just an ordinary fighter, yet they were fiercely engaged in mock battles, simulating real battlefield conditions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one exuded an aura of lethal intent, clearly the elite of the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found himself captivated by the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but imagine what would happen if his Blood Demon members were surrounded by the Hudson family army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The outcome was clear, they wouldn't stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Blood Demon members were immortal and could resurrect after death, they still couldn't compete against the Hudson family warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer number was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had only 10 thousand Blood Demon members, and among them, only three hundred had reached the Deity King level. The rest were merely peak Deity Overlords, while the Hudson family boasted over 10 thousand Deity King warriors, with more than a thousand at the peak level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they possibly fight against that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how many times the Blood Demon members revived, they would be swiftly cut down under the precise and overwhelming attack of the Hudson family warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their levels were just too low!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious. "Dukedom Level Power is just that powerful! I need to think of a way to elevate the Blood Demon members' levels. They can improve through blood energy, but their talents and potential have mostly been exhausted, leaving them stuck at the bottleneck of breaking through to Deity King. Only through using the Miracle Elixir can I enhance their potential, allowing them to break through and become Deity Kings. After that, I can use blood energy to accelerate their ascension!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he watched the Hudson family training, he became so engrossed that he completely lost sight of his original purpose for being there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until the training session ended and the 500 thousand troops dispersed that Osborne snapped back to reality, reminding himself why he had come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had come to Hudson Valley to see the Hudson family's Supernal Deity King with his own eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The head of the Hudson family is named Jethro. He should be the Supernal Deity King, right? Where's Jethro?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, scanning the entire Hudson Valley, but after a thorough sweep, he couldn't find the so-called "Supernal Deity King."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made him frown in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strange, no sign of any extraordinary individuals? Is the Hudson family's Supernal Deity King not at home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment before deciding to search again, this time with more focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, he noticed something odd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the innermost area of the Hudson family's territory, he spotted an incredibly ordinary-looking old man.</span></p><div class="pagination">
