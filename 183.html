  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin had not left the Radcliffe Manor yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found him and told him what he was thinking. Valentin suddenly became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, do you want to step on Chevalier Security's head and make our company known? Then we have to make things bigger and let more people know about this competition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded, "This is what I think. The bigger it is, the better. It would be best if all the big shots in Skyefall knew about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne whispered his plan in Valentin's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Valentin was shocked and seemed a little hesitant. "Mr. Augustine, isn't this taking it too far and too risky?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "The greater the risk, the higher the return! Just do as I say. Apollo is confident and arrogant. He will not refuse it! Even if we lose, I can afford it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin took a deep breath, and his eyes became firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, I know what to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, all of them appeared in the Radcliffe family's conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo looked at Valentin with disdain and sneered, "Valentin, we finally meet again! I said, if you dare to offend me, Skyefall Security will be closed! Now, how do you feel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ninety percent of your professional bodyguards have joined in Chevalier Security. Skyefall Security is not far from closing down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was very proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin also sneered, "It's just a little trick and can't shake Skyefall Security! But you, Mr. Chevalier, seemed a little embarrassed when you were escaping just now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo looked suddenly terrible at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted angrily, "You are just relying on the advanced weapons! If you dare, challenge me one-on-one. I will beat you to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I dare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere between Valentin and Apollo was tense, and it seemed that they were ready to fight at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! This is not the place for you to fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna finally stopped the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get down to business! Valentin, do you really agree to compete with Chevalier Security?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin smiled, "Chevalier Security wants to steal my business. Should I give it up? However, if he wants me to agree, he must agree to two conditions. Mr. Chevalier, you won't dare to agree, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo looked disdainful when he heard that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I not dare? Just tell me! As long as you agree to compete, I will let you know that Skyefall Security is nothing! In the future, Chevalier Security will be the absolute number one in Skyefall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin shrugged. "Mr. Chevalier, you look very confident. In that case, my first condition is that there must be enough bet in this contest. Otherwise, I don't want to waste my time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was stunned for a moment. Then, he couldn't help laughing. "That's exactly what I want! Tell me, how much is it? If it's too little, stop it. I'm not interested."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin sneered and raised one finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo said with disdain, "One hundred million dollars? Is that all? I am really disappointed. But it can make me play with you guys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin laughed and said, "Mr. Chevalier, I think you misunderstood. I didn't mean 100 million dollars. You are interested in it, but I am not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo snorted, "So is it one billion dollars? That's interesting. No problem. I agree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin still smiled and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, is this all you have? I'm not talking about 100 million, one billion, but 10 billion! I'm going to bet everything on you! The value of Skyefall Security is probably more than 10 billion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll bet you 10 billion with the entire Skyefall Security Services!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Skyefall Security loses, the entire Skyefall Security will belong to you! And if you lose, you have to give Skyefall Security 10 billion in cash or something of equal value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you dare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Valentin finished speaking, the surroundings suddenly became extremely quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo, Donna, Barlyn, and Clarissa all looked at Valentin in disbelief and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten billion dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin actually wanted to bet the entire Skyefall Security with Apollo? How dared he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was he so confident?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo became solemn and thought he had heard it wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin repeated, smiling, "Mr. Chevalier, don't you dare? I'm really disappointed. Since you don't dare, I don't think there's any need for this contest. You are not qualified to steal Skyefall Security's business! Chevalier Security will never be compared with Skyefall Security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin looked at Apollo with arrogance and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo stood up immediately in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually said I don't dare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Valentin, since you are offering Skyefall Security to me, why shouldn't I accept it? If you want to play, I will accompany you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I accept the 10 billion bet! I will invite the five ancient families in Skyefall to witness this contest so that you won't deny your loss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I have a request, too!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
