  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt relieved seeing that Callista was intimidated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only use the Apocalypse Bow once a day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Callista insisted on saving Weston now, Osborne really had no good solution. Without using the Apocalypse Bow, even if he gave it his all, he might not be able to harm Callista.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Callista was intimidated by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, no one knew that Osborne could only use the Apocalypse Bow once a day. Faced with the terrifying Apocalypse Bow, even Frederick kept his distance for the time being, let alone Callista.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Anyone dares to move, I don&rsquo;t mind killing one more!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne used spatial power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body appeared outside the Protective Barrier. Grabbing Weston, he quickly used interdimensional travel to return inside the Protective Barrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne completely relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally dealt with an enemy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered, "Now, I'll give you ten breaths to leave here! I said, my revenge has only just begun! I'll play with you slowly, making you live in fear and regret forever!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't push me to deal with you right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne raised the Apocalypse Bow again, his eyes filled with icy killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, everyone around was startled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn and Naomi quickly retreated without hesitation, fearing they might become Osborne's next revenge target.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston is much stronger than them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Weston couldn't block a single arrow, so how could they? They would definitely be killed by Osborne with one shot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they were terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they retreated and fled, others quickly backed away as well, equally worried about being Osborne's next target and getting shot directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment of struggle and hesitation, Callista could only cast a venomous glance at Osborne before quickly retreating into the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, just you wait!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You dare hurt my Weston, I won't let you off!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, she had already run far away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, only Frederick remained, standing neither too far nor too close, frowning as he looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne met his gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have five seconds to leave! If you don't go after five seconds, then stay here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick laughed at this, "You bastard, no need to bluff. The more you act like this, the more it shows you have no confidence in dealing with us! Otherwise, with your hatred for us, how could you possibly let us leave so easily?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to deal with us slowly, make us live in fear?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's just your excuse! In reality, you can't deal with us right now! If I'm not mistaken, you can no longer draw that powerful bow again, nor shoot a second arrow, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Frederick finished speaking, Osborne's expression immediately changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn&rsquo;t panic and calmly replied, "Oh? Are you so sure? Why wouldn&rsquo;t I be able to draw a bow? My Sacred Power is still at its peak!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne unleashed a powerful surge of Sacred Power around him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone could feel the vast and immense power of Osborne's Sacred Power, undoubtedly at its peak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After sensing Osborne's Sacred Power, Frederick was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Could I have guessed wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was indeed at his peak. That previous arrow didn't seem to drain much of his strength!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this rate, Osborne could not only shoot a second arrow but even a third and fourth without any problem!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, he didn&rsquo;t step back. Instead, he smiled and said, &ldquo;I still think you definitely can&rsquo;t shoot a second arrow! So, I want to give it a try. Come on! The ten seconds are up. Shoot your second arrow!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick emitted a dark red glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had fully activated the Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor and taken out several other Supreme Defensive Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He dared to stay because he guessed Osborne couldn&rsquo;t shoot a second arrow and had great confidence in his own defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he guessed wrong and Osborne could shoot a second arrow, he was confident he could block it with his defense, at most getting slightly injured, but definitely not dying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he was coldly staring at Osborne at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go ahead! Aren't you still at your peak? Why not shoot a second arrow? Could it be you really can't shoot another one?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't make a move, I will."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's face was full of cold sneers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne still hadn't shot the second arrow, Frederick became even more confident in his judgment, his face full of self-assurance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Trying to scare me? Make me back off?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad! I said today you must die! You, bastard, Ms. Alba, and all the other members of the Fairy Moon Sect must die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The bow and arrow in your hand are mine now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick is very arrogant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and slowly lowered the Apocalypse Bow because he knew he had been seen through by Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the king of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, Frederick was not frightened by Osborne's words!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "You want to die, but I won't grant your wish! I said I would slowly torture and humiliate you. I will take revenge on you all step by step. I will make it happen!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just clean your necks and wait for me to come collect my debt from you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne glanced at Adriana behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get ready to escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apocalypse Bow did not scare Frederick away, so Osborne had no choice. His cultivation level was, after all, only at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, still a gap in strength compared to the current Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, there was Callista nearby, along with nearly fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If these people launched an attack, it would be trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can your bow really only shoot one arrow?" Adriana quickly asked through Telepathy. She looked a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Osborne had severely injured Weston with a single arrow, leaving her both shocked and thrilled. Weston&rsquo;s strength wasn&rsquo;t much weaker than hers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne possessing such terrifying strength, what was there to fear? The Royal Family couldn't possibly destroy the Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family should be more worried about being wiped out by Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, she was disappointed. Osborne seemed to only be able to shoot that terrifying arrow once.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded without hiding anything. "I can only shoot one arrow a day!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's get ready to leave!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Temporarily give up on the Fairy Moon Sect! Once you break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, or my strength improves further, we'll come back for revenge."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She waved her hand, and immediately all the Fairy Moon Sect warriors surrounded them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's face immediately changed upon seeing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to escape? Impossible! No one is getting away! You useless fools were scared off by a bastard and ran so far! All of you, get back here, break the Protective Barrier, and kill them all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered and glanced at him coldly, saying indifferently, "Emperor Frederick, don't waste your energy! You can't stop us from leaving! Just wait. I'll be back soon! When I return next time, it will be your death day! It will be the day the Royal Family falls!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick shouted angrily, "There won't be a next time for you! I will hunt you down! You're dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then give it a try!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly and quickly returned to Ice Crystal Hall with the others. At the moment the Protective Barrier was shattered, they had already activated the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, everyone disappeared.</span></p><div class="pagination">
