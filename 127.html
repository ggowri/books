  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They agreed to go again. However, Austin quickly forgot and was brought to pleasure by Osborne again and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cooperated wildly. She demanded endlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't know how often they did it until late at night. It was until Austin's last bit of strength was exhausted, and she lay quietly in Osborne's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fingers gently traced circles on Osborne's chest. Her face was flushed with satisfaction. She looked up at Osborne's face and smiled gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we tried so many times. I should be able to get pregnant, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a wry smile. "I don't know. I'm a bit confused. Do you not need me to be responsible? I can sign a prenup and not take a penny from your family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will also work hard to make everyone think I'm worthy of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin bit her lip and shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you don't have to! Just be the father of my child. As for the rest, I won't think about it. Neither should you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then smiled nonchalantly. "I'm just borrowing your sperm. It won't affect your life. You can date or marry anyone you want. I'll bless you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, I still got the better deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin proudly said, "Barlyn told me you're a psychic metahuman. Do you know how rare psychic metahumans are? Our child will automatically inherit your powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe! By then, my family will become a metahuman family, too! This is much more reliable than picking sperm from a sperm bank."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne heard this and smiled bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that's the case, Austin and her family got the better deal because he wasn't a psychic metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power was Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye was much stronger than a regular psychic power. If Austin and her child inherited Satan's Eye, her family would soar to new heights because of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin didn't just get a good deal. She hit the jackpot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne didn't mind. He wanted a child of his own, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia had once been pregnant with his child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Ophelia had been forced by her family to abort the child secretly. Osborne was devastated for a long time and was very depressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin, who was even more outstanding than Ophelia, was willing to have his child. How could he object?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne felt uplifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin, you are already my woman, no matter what you think. I will protect you. If we have a child, I'll protect both of you. You can tell me if you change your mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke seriously, and Austin fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes filled with a light mist. She hugged Osborne's waist tightly and pressed her pretty face against his chest, suddenly feeling that this was very nice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could be with Osborne openly, maybe it wouldn't be so bad?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, she couldn't!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the sole heir of the prestigious Montague family. Her father, an only child, lost the ability to have children shortly after she was born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, from a young age, she was designated as the sole heir of the Montague family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew from a young age that she could never marry because the elders of her family would never allow an outsider to take over their assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she couldn't be with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, she couldn't let the elders know she was with Osborne. Or he would be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin said seriously, "Osborne, I will protect you and not let anyone hurt you, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and tweaked her nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, we should get up! Luckily, Barlyn didn't come back due to an emergency. Otherwise, he would be shocked to see us like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin also laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want him to know! Osborne, can we keep it a secret from everyone? Even our closest friends?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do as you say!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They finally got out of bed. Osborne held Austin's hand as they went downstairs to eat something to regain their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin was very obedient, following closely behind Osborne like a wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, only when no one was around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as someone appeared, Austin would immediately let go of Osborne's hand and keep her distance, as if they were just ordinary friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After eating, Osborne was ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin quickly hugged Osborne and kissed him on the lips when no one was around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I will secretly miss you," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, rubbed her head, and said, "Miss me a little less and get some rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Osborne rushed to the Radcliffe Manor early in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was the fourth day of his third heir test. There were only three days left until the deadline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wanted to finish the test in one go today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was already looking forward to the reward for completing the test.</span></p><div class="pagination">
