Clad in opulent robes, he wielded a prestigious scepter and proudly displayed the Flame Sovereign Badge on his chest, a symbol of his status as a member of the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His name was inscribed on the medal: Prince Desmond Garza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he exuded an aura of charm and authority, drawing admiring glances from many ordinary members of the Elf Race and even beings from other races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Desmond maintained a cool demeanor, embodying the haughty pride expected of a royal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside him stood several other members of the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family: one prince and two princesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were Prince Enzo Garza, Princess Monica, and Princess Carie Garza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, these four represented the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family, tasked with selecting talented young warriors from all races to join their exploration teams. They would protect the royal members as they ventured into Umbra Earth in search of treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the princesses, strikingly beautiful with fiery red hair and lips to match, radiated a fierce energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Flame Sovereign Badge bore her name&mdash;Princess Monica Garza!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the very Monica who had a grudge against Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly cast a glance at them before averting his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fire Elf Clan would never recruit him; even if they were willing, he wouldn't want to join them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who knew if being part of their team would put him directly in the crosshairs of Desmond and Monica?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't about to invite trouble upon himself, so he shifted his focus to other Elf Royal Families present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elf City was home to nine distinct Elf Clans, ranked from strongest to weakest: Shadow Elf Clan, Light Elf Clan, Sylvan Elf Clan, Thunder Elf Clan, Storm Elf Clan, Fire Elf Clan, Ocean Elf Clan, Life Elf Clan, and Nature Elf Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Notably, the Light Elf Clan had no Royal Family; all members served as priests in the Ethereal Elven Temple, dedicating their lives to the service of the Elven Creator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, there were eight Elf Royal Families in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, aside from the Life Elf Clan and Nature Elf Clan, which had not sent representatives, the remaining six Royal Families had sent members to the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some families sent only one or two princes or princesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, the Ocean Elf Clan had brought just two princes and one princess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, the Shadow Elf Clan made a grand entrance with nine princes and seven princesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sylvan Elf Clan followed closely behind with five princes and three princesses, while the Thunder Elf Clan sent four princes and four princesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Storm Elf Clan had three princes and three princesses, and the Fire Elf Clan was represented by two princes and two princesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, the six major Elf Royal Families had sent an impressive twenty-five princes and twenty princesses to the arena, creating a dazzling spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many residents of Elf City, who had lived there for centuries, had likely never witnessed such a gathering of royal figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those who were too old or unqualified to join the exploration teams couldn't resist flocking to the Combat Arena just to catch a glimpse of these handsome princes and beautiful princesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "Twenty-five Elf princes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty princesses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All under three hundred years old!

It was no surprise that they were the most powerful Elf Race in Elf City. Among the nine princes and seven princesses present, even the </span><span>one with the </span><span>lowest cultivation level was Ascension Four Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impressive lineup included two at Ascension Six and five at Ascension Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A total of nine boasted Ascension Four, making their presence downright intimidating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Elf City, only the Light Elf Clan could stand toe-to-toe with the Shadow Elf Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond that, the Sylvan Elf Clan Royal Family had one prince at Ascension Six, who just happened to be seated next to Princess Joanna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than her brother, Prince Chuck Edmund.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, not every royal family member had such high cultivation levels. Osborne noticed a couple of princes and princesses with only Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were Princess Peggy Melano from the Storm Elf Clan and Prince Dominic Grantham from the Ocean Elf Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from those two, the rest of the royals boasted at least Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The breakdown was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were three at Ascension Six, nine at Ascension Five, twelve at Ascension Four, nineteen at Ascension Three, and two at Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the crowd, Osborne couldn't help but feel a sense of awe as he observed the young talents from the Elf Royal Families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, marveling at the sheer talent before him, "These are all under three hundred years old!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings? In Celestara, warriors of that caliber are practically a rarity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they've trained for over a thousand years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's just terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he couldn't overlook the fact that the young warriors from various races were no slouches either. Many in the crowd had achieved Ascension Six or Five, proving that they were indeed the prodigies from across the galaxies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a gathering of super geniuses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he scanned the crowd, he spotted Jaden, Renata, and Letitia, all at Ascension Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had made their way to the vicinity of the Shadow Elf Clan Royal Family's platform, seemingly eager to join their exploration team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, he also noticed hundreds of super geniuses from the Human Community, with the highest cultivation level reaching Ascension Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That particular Human warrior was also registering with the Shadow Elf Clan Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere around the Shadow Elf Clan was electric, with sixteen princes and princesses present, all looking to recruit eight hundred young talents from various races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their standards were sky-high&mdash;only those with a cultivation level of at least Ascension Four could even apply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be selected, candidates needed to possess unique abilities; a regular Ascension Four Supernal Deity King might not even make the cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took one glance and quickly decided to pass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his cultivation level at a mere Ascension One, he wouldn't even qualify to register. Approaching would only lead to being shooed away by the Shadow Elves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, strength dictated status, and the Shadow Elf Clan was the most formidable group in Elf City, exuding an air of dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sylvan Elf Clan Royal Family was also buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the second most powerful Royal Family, and with Prince Chuck's cultivation level at Ascension Six, they attracted a slew of young talents eager to join their exploration team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their requirements were similarly stringent: a minimum cultivation level of Ascension Three, with a preference for those possessing special abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling increasingly disheartened, Osborne shook his head again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was simply unqualified for the cultivation level requirement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no choice but to keep searching for other royal families, hoping to find one with more lenient entry criteria.</span></p><div class="pagination">
