  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett suddenly burst into laughter, his words causing everyone's expression to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does the League of Divine Descent really have reinforcements?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they already here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm, as he had anticipated this situation long before. At that moment, he could already see the reinforcements of the League of Divine Descent approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes showed a hint of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They actually came in like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distant sky, a dark cloud was being driven by a fierce wind, moving toward them at an incredible speed. Osborne's sharp gaze penetrated the cloud, seeing more than three hundred figures sitting cross-legged within it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them radiated an immensely powerful aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all Class S warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the group was a blonde man who looked somewhat aged, but his eyes were sharp. It was he who was manipulating the wind to carry the dark cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the dark cloud hovered above everyone's heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a terrifying pressure suddenly descended upon them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A second later, three hundred formidable figures emerged from the cloud, rapidly descending to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's eyes were filled with excitement and relief; they were saved! He had managed to stall long enough for the reinforcements to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was time for revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Osborne with a cold gaze and said, "Osborne, you're done for! You dared to kill so many of our League of Divine Descent's elite warriors. No one can save you now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead, without a doubt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Everett rushed forward. When he saw the blonde man leading the group, his expression grew even more intense with respect and a hint of reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hastings, you actually came in person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett bowed slightly to the blonde man, showing utmost politeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde man nodded in acknowledgment. "Something this serious happened; of course, I had to come personally. Everett, what happened here? You brought a hundred people, and now there are only a few of you left. Where are the others?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's face twisted with anger, and he gritted his teeth. "Dead! They're all dead! Only a handful of us survived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all because of the Augustine family! It's all because of him! Mr. Hastings, if you had come just a little later, we'd all be dead by now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed furiously at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde man's expression darkened immediately, his voice rising. "All dead? A hundred Class S warriors and only a few of you survived?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his fierce gaze toward Osborne, the killing intent in his eyes boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, calm, meeting the blonde man's stare. He could sense that this man was incredibly powerful, likely even stronger than Armstrong or Sin, definitely a top-tier Class S warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Everett would not have shown him such reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that this man's presence was similar to that of Gerardo, who had fused with the corpse of a deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was undoubtedly a formidable opponent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And beyond him, the three hundred Class S warriors from the League of Divine Descent were even more alarming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Class S fighters were not clones!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were bona fide Class S warriors. Sending three hundred Class S warriors on a mission showed that the League of Divine Descent's strength far exceeded Osborne's expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he remained unafraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you the Deputy Leader of the League of Divine Descent?" Osborne asked calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde man was clearly taken aback that Osborne could face him and three hundred Class S warriors without the slightest hint of panic or fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sneer, the man replied, "That's right, I'm one of the Deputy Leaders of the League of Divine Descent. My name is Reginald Hastings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said this with a face full of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the name, Osborne froze for a moment, and then his eyes lit up with a cold, sharp intensity as he locked onto the blonde man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This name was all too familiar to Osborne. His grandfather, Sebastian, had once told him that among the three suspects who had abducted his parents, one was the Deputy Leader of the League of Divine Descent&mdash;Reginald!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty-five years ago, Sebastian had gone to the League of Divine Descent searching for Reginald, only to be severely injured by Helios, which resulted in his diminished power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you are Reginald?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth, his voice icy cold. "Well, great! I haven't even begun looking for you, and here you are, appearing right before me. Capturing you alive here will save me a lot of trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald's expression turned to one of utter bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only him but all three hundred Class S warriors behind him, including Everett, were stunned, then burst out laughing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their laughter was filled with scorn and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did he just say? Did he say he wants to capture Mr. Hastings alive? Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is hilarious! He actually thinks he can capture Mr. Hastings alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald's face twisted into a malicious grin. "Boy, you think you can capture me? Hah! On what grounds? With this group of Class AAA elite warriors? With the useless scum from your Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was filled with disdain. "Nearly five thousand Class AAA warriors. Impressive! But to think they could handle our three hundred Class S warriors? That's just laughable!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
