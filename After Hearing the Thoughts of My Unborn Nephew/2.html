        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver was reborn too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If I can't leave now, I definitely won't be able to leave in two days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I clenched my teeth, tightened my fists, and forced myself to calm down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I said, "Grace, I never persuaded you to have an abortion from the start. Why are you stopping me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My mom's not feeling well. If something happens, can you take responsibility?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she's still young. When I pressed her, she hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver wouldn't let me off, shouting sharply, "It's all an excuse! Liam just couldn't stand Mom refusing to abort me and wanted someone to take her away for a forced abortion!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, you have to believe me. I was reborn. In my previous life, Liam dragged you to the hospital and made you abort me. You injured your uterus and couldn't have children anymore. Dad despised you and kicked you out. Grandpa and Grandma's luck turned bad. Aunt Fiona got laid off. The whole family lived miserably, all because of Liam."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I said coldly, "You're talking nonsense!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I never did those things!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver sneered, "Uncle Liam, you're reborn too, right? You should know if the lottery will win in two days, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If the lottery win is true, then why can't the other things I said be true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I froze all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace stared at me without blinking. "Liam, is what my son said true? Have you been reborn too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I picked up the suitcase, trying to stay calm. "Rebirth? I don't know what you're talking about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to have a child, I support you. But you can't stop me from going home, or I'll call the police and report you for illegal detention."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the tense atmosphere, Oliver got a bit anxious and quickly said, "Hurry, lock him in the warehouse, don't let him out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take his phone too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace's eyes immediately turned red. "Mom, Dad, Fiona, are you just going to watch Liam bully me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I finally got pregnant with this child. I'll just lock Liam up for two days. If the lottery doesn't win after two days, we'll let him out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace, who had been spoiled since childhood, was always the center of the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking that winning the lottery wasn't something that could just happen, everyone forcibly dragged me, took away my phone, and locked me in the warehouse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I banged on the door and roared, "Fiona, open the door! What that child said is completely unreliable! Let me out now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I swear I will never do anything bad to Grace or her child. Open the door!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona stood outside the door, persuading me, "Just wait two days for my sake, so Grace can feel at ease."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I believe you. As long as the lottery isn't won, I'll let you out immediately."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I sat on the ground in despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I thought, "The lottery will definitely win. Oliver is so sure of this, that's why he's so arrogant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But there's no way to verify the events of the past life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I stayed in the warehouse for two days and nearly went crazy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver said a lot of bad things about me to Grace, making her especially wary of me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't even dare to step near the warehouse, fearing I might harm her child.</p></div>
