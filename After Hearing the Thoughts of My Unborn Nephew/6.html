        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I pressed my lips together and said softly, "Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. I won't let myself be wronged."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I don't dare tell them about my rebirth, afraid they'll feel guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since I've been given a second chance, I will make up for all those regrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing me say this, they were worried but still trusted me and didn't ask further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I started preparing the materials.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking advantage of Fiona's imprisonment for her crimes, I decisively filed for divorce in court.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Coming out of the court, looking at the divorce certificate in my hand, I heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half a month passed, and Benjamin and Victoria, seeing that Fiona hadn't been bailed out, came to my house to question me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I casually said, "Bail isn't that simple. If you keep pressuring me, I won't bail her out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Benjamin and Victoria had no choice. Though unhappy, they didn't dare provoke me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After settling the ties between Fiona and me, I personally wrote the bail letter, forgiving her actions and agreeing to let her out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police took the documents but hesitated to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, what Fiona did was very dangerous. If it happens again, they might not be able to save me in time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I understood what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But I was ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing my firm attitude, the police stopped persuading and took the documents to process the bail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment Fiona saw me, her eyes turned red. "I didn't expect you to love me so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll absolutely listen to you from now on, okay? Let's go home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She endured so much suffering in prison, and seeing me afterward filled her heart with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I took two steps back. "Fiona, we were already divorced when you went to prison. This is the official divorce certificate from the court. I&rsquo;m here today just to hand it over to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'll need it if you get married again in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She froze, looking at me in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My task was done, and I got in the car and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The plane's about to take off. If I miss it, I won't be able to fly with my parents for the trip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I've been handling the paperwork for going abroad these past two weeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Fiona, with her abilities, she can't possibly find me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did I let her out? Because staying in prison was too easy for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as Oliver is alive, their days won't be easy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I boarded the plane with my parents, completely leaving all the troubles behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Fiona got home, she was still dazed, not fully reacting yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Benjamin and Victoria were overjoyed to see her return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Victoria said, "Looks like we misunderstood Liam. I didn't expect him to actually bail you out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fiona, you must have suffered in prison, right? I'll cook you a good meal right away. By the way, where's Liam? He hasn't been home for half a month, and Grace has lost her appetite. Hurry and get him back to cook; Oliver loves his cooking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona finally came to her senses and said, "Liam divorced me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Victoria didn't believe it. "How is that possible? He loves you so much. If you two are divorced, who would marry him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My mom threatened him back then, saying if he didn't bail you out, you'd leave him. He was terrified at the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They still think I'm the old Liam, unable to leave Fiona.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, I didn't know any of this. At that time, I was traveling abroad with my parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace stroked her flat belly as she walked over and said, "Fiona, it's just a man. Once we have money, we can have as many as we want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Here, these are the new winning numbers Oliver just predicted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver snorted lightly, "That's right, even though I didn't kill him, it's fine if he stays far away and doesn't cause trouble. Mom, you have to take good care of me. I'm a lucky star, and once I'm out, I'll help you make big money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By then, you can find as many men as you want."</p></div>
