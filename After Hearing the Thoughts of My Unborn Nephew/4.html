        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Benjamin and Victoria being swayed again, I narrowed my eyes and sneered, "Oliver, you claim to be reborn. How do you know about what happened after the abortion in your past life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver is still just a child. Seeing he couldn't outtalk me, he started throwing a tantrum and shouting, "You must die! If you don't die, I'll die in the womb!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace panicked, gently stroking her belly. "You can't have anything happen to you. Of course, I'll listen to you, but Liam is right too. If we end up with a murder case, your future won't be easy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver snorted coldly, "Then take him to a deserted place and kill him, or push him off a cliff and say he accidentally fell while playing. Either way, he must die."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I shouted angrily, "Why do you have to kill me? Do you feel better only if the whole family carries a murder case?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you even care about your family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver just kept insisting that everyone kill me, or he wouldn't live.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace looked at me awkwardly. "Sorry, my son said you must die. He's the lucky star, so please just endure it and jump off the cliff."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I laughed in anger. "Just because he won you a $500,000 lottery, you believe him unconditionally?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if you erase the traces of killing me, flaws will eventually show!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver suddenly dropped a bombshell, "Aunt Fiona, you bought insurance for Liam back then, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One sentence changed the expression on everyone's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially Fiona, she stared at me intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The accidental insurance coverage is three million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona pressed me step by step, saying, "Don't blame me for being ruthless, blame your bad luck."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I turned and ran.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I had just rushed out the door when I suddenly tripped!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Benjamin tripped me with his leg, and I fell to the ground, hitting the back of my head hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everything went black before my eyes, and I completely lost consciousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I woke up from the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I opened my eyes and found Fiona dragging me up the mountain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My clothes were torn full of holes, and my exposed skin was scraped, oozing blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I gritted my teeth and struggled. "Fiona, you'd better let me go, or you won't have a chance later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona frowned, and seeing me resisting, she casually picked up a stick and hit me on the head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A searing pain tore through my scalp, my vision darkened, and the sting spread through my body like wildfire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I don't know how long it took, but we finally reached the mountaintop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This place is remote, almost no one comes here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems they chose it carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My eyes were red as I stared at her intently. "Fiona, this is your last chance. If you really push me down, no one will be able to save you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said nothing, just kept a cold face, dragged me to the edge of the cliff, and suddenly pushed me off!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I shouted, "Fiona, you're finished!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona stood at the edge of the cliff, looking at me coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next second, the police pinned her down at the edge of the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My parents leaned over the edge of the cliff and shouted, "Liam!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this, I laughed.</p></div>
