        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona watched me floating in the air, her eyes red with rage!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She struggled excitedly, staring intently at the helicopter circling in the sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A person came down from the helicopter, untied me, and safely brought me to the edge of the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fierce wind howled, kicking up a cloud of dust. As the helicopter departed, the dust gradually settled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona stared at me, her voice trembling. "How did you survive?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I chuckled lightly and said, "Did you really think that if I actually died, you could just claim it was because we argued, and I impulsively jumped? With no evidence, the police wouldn't be able to do anything to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Too bad, I had already set up a safety net below just to catch myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told you, if you let me go, you'd still have a chance. But you let money blind you, completely bewitched by Oliver."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She struggled in vain, then stopped moving, her eyes fixed on me, filled with shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I walked up to her and whispered so only the two of us could hear, "Oliver was right, I really was reborn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She widened her eyes, her gaze filled with hatred toward me. If the police weren&rsquo;t holding her, she would&rsquo;ve strangled me on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Too bad, she no longer had a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I sneered, "But apart from the lottery thing, everything else he said was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In my previous life, I listened to you and persuaded Grace to have an abortion. She did, and then the lottery won. You all blamed me for losing the money. I was slapped dozens of times by you and hacked to death by Grace with a kitchen knife. And you just coldly said I ruined your chance to get rich.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was clearly you who made me persuade Grace, yet in the end, I was the only one who died. Fiona, I was so unwilling."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This time, I won't let you live comfortably."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona finally panicked and screamed, "What are you trying to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police took Fiona away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I hugged my parents, tears of excitement streaming down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After being reborn, I immediately found a chance to message them, asking them to pay attention to my situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were very alert, immediately reported to the police secretly, and cooperated with the rescue operation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Fiona knocked me out and took me to the mountain, the protective net at the foot of the mountain was already in place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, when I saw the helicopter flying overhead, I knew I wouldn't die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Fiona, I couldn't really let her spend the rest of her life in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Days like that would be too easy for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I want to make her life worse than death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was charged with attempted murder, with solid evidence, but not enough for the death penalty. She was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Benjamin and Victoria found out about this, they came to me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Benjamin said, "Liam, I know Fiona did something wrong, but you&rsquo;re husband and wife. How could a husband send his wife to prison himself? It&rsquo;s such a joke if people hear about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Victoria continued to persuade, "Hurry up and bail her out. If you're this heartless, who would dare marry you in the future? You can't stay single forever, can you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We are your elders, after all. You should listen to us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As long as you listen, even if you and Fiona don&rsquo;t have kids in this lifetime, we won&rsquo;t mind. We can raise Oliver together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After they finished speaking, I said, "Got it. Go back and wait for news."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They thought they had convinced me, their expressions softened a lot, and before leaving, they even patted my shoulder politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My dad angrily muttered curses at their backs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My mom looked at me with concern. "Why didn&rsquo;t you let us speak just now? If you hadn&rsquo;t stopped him, your dad would&rsquo;ve thrown a punch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I patted her hand and noticed it was much rougher than I remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wrinkles on her face were also increasing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about how I was brutally killed in my past life, how heartbroken would they be if they knew?</p></div>
