        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The warehouse was small, filled with clutter piled on both sides, leaving me to curl up on the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The cold floor made me increasingly restless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two days later, cheers suddenly erupted outside the door, and my heart sank abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't expect to actually win."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Five hundred thousand dollars!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oliver is truly our lucky star."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver said proudly, "Now you believe it, right? It was Liam who bribed the hospital to fake the diagnosis saying I have supermale syndrome."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He just can't stand seeing us doing well. So you must kill him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, the whole family gasped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I immediately banged on the door, my voice hoarse. "Oliver, killing is against the law. Do you want your mom to spend her life in prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Benjamin, Victoria, if you don't trust me, I can divorce Fiona."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver continued, "You're after my mom's five hundred thousand dollars. Only if you're dead will they not split the money with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He tried to convince everyone, "You can't go soft. Liam is really bad. Even if I'm born safely, he'll find a way to kill me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span>In his previous life, he was jealous of my exceptional talent. After causing me to be aborted, he cheated with another woman and got her pregnant. That child was born with XYY syndrome and ended up killing both his maternal grandparents.<span>&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you must kill Liam, or you'll end up being harmed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm doing this for your own good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The door was forcefully pulled open, and Fiona stared at me with a grim face. "Liam, I didn't expect you to be so vicious, not even sparing a child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My heart tightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I never thought Oliver could be so vicious as to want me dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I took a deep breath and said, "Fiona, if you don't trust me, we can sign an agreement. I'll leave with nothing and promise never to contact you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We can get it notarized at a law firm. You need to understand that murder is illegal. If you act, Oliver will be fine, but you'll end up in prison. You've just won a $500,000 lottery, and there could be more in the future. Do you really want to become murderers?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona was convinced by me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I continued to persuade, "Oliver is a prodigy, smart and capable. You want to do business now that you have money, right? If you're labeled as murderers, people will criticize you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A hint of hesitation flashed in Grace's eyes. "Yeah, Oliver is going to attend a prestigious university in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Carrying the label of a murderer's family, he will be looked down upon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Benjamin nodded repeatedly. "That's right, reputation is more important. We can't waste Oliver's good genes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver became anxious. "No way! You must kill Liam!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even though he's saying this now, he'll definitely grab a knife and kill you all later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He was reborn too and knows the lottery numbers. He'll take the ticket first, leaving you with nothing. You can't let him go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'll all end up dying at his hands!"</p></div>
