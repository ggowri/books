        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona, in her excitement, immediately forgot about me and carefully started taking care of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While she was shopping with Grace, she took a liking to a handsome college student.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, she asked Grace for money to flirt with the handsome guy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace, while eating, didn't even look up and said, "No money left, it's all spent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona was shocked. "Five hundred thousand dollars all spent?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then where's the money you're spending now from?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace replied matter-of-factly, "It's overdrafted. Anyway, the next lottery jackpot is two hundred million dollars. My son said we can spend freely and just pay it back after winning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad bought a car, Mom got a full set of jewelry. Whatever you want, just overdraft it. Once the two hundred million dollars come in, I'll transfer it to you directly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona was instantly tempted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two hundred million dollars, that's a huge amount of money!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Previously, she heard from Victoria that the full set of jewelry was only one million dollars, and the car was just five hundred thousand dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two hundred million dollars could buy plenty of these things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't hold back and immediately went to get a new car and buy a villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The villa cost three million dollars, and the new car cost one million dollars. She also bought several beautiful outfits, luxury items, and went out on dates with male college students.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She kept switching men for dates, having the time of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she ran out of money, she overdrafted. In the end, they couldn't even figure out how much they had spent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona worriedly asked Grace, "When are we claiming the prize? It's almost been a month, and the credit card payment is due."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace nonchalantly said, "What's the rush? It's not time yet. Just tell them it'll definitely arrive next month."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Two hundred million dollars, and you haven't even spent tens of millions yet. What are you afraid of?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona finally felt at ease and continued her reckless spending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, the prize redemption day arrived, and Grace went to the redemption place with the lottery numbers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She slapped the lottery ticket on the table and said, "Redeem."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The lottery shop owner glanced at her and smiled slightly. "Alright, please wait a moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The owner scanned the lottery ticket with the machine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona nervously asked, "Did I win?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The owner still smiled. "Yes, ma'am."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona was overjoyed; she had been having a great time lately. "Looks like Oliver is truly a lucky charm. Ever since he came, we've been winning every time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grace, later you settle my debt first. They're so annoying, pestering even before it's overdue, like they've never seen money before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace casually said, "How much do you owe?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona grinned and said, "Not much, with interest, just ten million dollars. Compared to your winnings, it's nothing at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace said smugly, "Of course, but you spend way more than Mom and Dad. Take it easy, it's just two hundred million dollars. Spending tens of millions like this won't last long."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona said nonchalantly, "Got it, anyway, Oliver can win the lottery again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the boss silently placed ten dollars and a bottle of soy sauce in front of them. "Here, this is your prize."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace's face changed dramatically. "What do you mean? We won two hundred million dollars, and you&rsquo;re giving us a bottle of soy sauce and ten dollars?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you believe I'll report you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boss kept smiling. "Sorry, ma'am, your prize is ten dollars and a bottle of soy sauce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Look here, we use machine scanning, no fraud involved. The real two-hundred-million-dollar prize isn't in this city, and it was won by a man who has already claimed it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Impossible!" Grace screamed, "You must have taken our money! Fiona, call the police!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona called the police with a grim face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all the commotion, the lottery result was indeed ten dollars and a bottle of soy sauce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The entire Harrison family was so scared that their legs went weak, and they collapsed to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They are now burdened with a whopping 20 million dollars in debt!</p></div>
