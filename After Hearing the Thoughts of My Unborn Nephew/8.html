        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without the 200 million dollar prize, how could they pay it back?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Victoria nervously grabbed Grace's hand, her voice trembling. "Quick, ask Oliver what's going on. Why did the promised 200 million dollars suddenly disappear?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could he have remembered it wrong? We can hold on a bit longer; maybe we'll really win next month!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace gradually regained her composure and immediately asked her belly, "Oliver, say something, what's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver burst out laughing and said, "It's fake. I know the winning numbers, but I just won't tell you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I did it on purpose!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona's face instantly turned pale. "Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver sneered, "Why? Don't think I don't know. As soon as you heard I have Superhero Syndrome, you didn't want me anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was you who urged Liam to persuade my mom to abort me. If my mom had insisted on keeping me, maybe I wouldn't have sought revenge on you. But she didn't want me either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In that case, none of you will have it easy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your lives are completely ruined. I'm so happy. This is what you deserve."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four looked ashen, as if their souls had been drained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They fully realized they had been played.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, their whole family was kicked out of the lottery shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at the soy sauce by her feet, Fiona angrily smashed it on the ground, grabbed Grace's shoulder, and snarled, "You must pay it back. This is your fault we owe money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace bit Fiona's arm hard, broke free, and said in a trembling voice, "I didn't make you spend so much! Why should I pay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it weren't for what your son said, would I have borrowed so much money? You said you'd pay it back! Now you're trying to dodge?" Fiona stared at her intently, pressing closer step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace, spoiled since childhood and fearing nothing, started wrestling with Fiona, pulling hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The debt collectors separated them and took everything under their names.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The newly bought house, car, and luxury items could be sold, covering most of the debt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The debt collectors also took their original house, barely settling the debt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace's husband, furious upon hearing this, complained about not sharing the good times but being left with the mess. He immediately filed for divorce and married Grace's best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace was so angry that she almost had a miscarriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver was overjoyed and laughed, saying, "Your lives are ruined forever. Serves you right for wanting to get rid of me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace gritted her teeth, her face darkening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Three years later, while traveling with my parents, I found a new opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">We simply moved overseas and thrived abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time we returned to the country because it was my mother's good friend's birthday, and we had to come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before coming back, I briefly inquired about those people's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona seems to have been sent to prison for fraud and impulsive assault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Benjamin and Victoria are nowhere to be found, probably hiding in some slum to scrape by.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace eventually gave birth to Oliver. The two of them love and hate each other, neither willing to back down. When Oliver was just two, he stabbed one of Grace's eyes with scissors, while his body was covered in bruises from being beaten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for more details, I didn't look into them further. It has nothing to do with me anymore anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the birthday party, my parents and I went out shopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they walked, they marveled at the changes in the city, reminiscing about how they first met and got to know each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a short person biting a woman hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I looked closely and saw it was Oliver fiercely biting Grace's thigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her thigh was covered in bloody holes, with blood streaming down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She fought back, grabbing Oliver by the neck and slamming him hard against the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A chill ran down my spine as I secretly recorded a video and called the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police said they had been secretly monitoring Grace and Oliver's situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They said anyone born with superhuman genes is monitored 24/7, so I shouldn't worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Oliver makes any wrong move, they will arrest him immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They also considered sending Oliver to a welfare home, but kids with superhuman genes are too hard to manage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Plus, since Grace insisted on giving birth, they chose not to intervene and only observe secretly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I breathed a sigh of relief and continued showing my parents around the hometown I hadn't visited in three years.</p></div>
