        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My name is Liam Hayes. After my wife Fiona Harrison's sister, Grace Harrison, became pregnant with her son Oliver, who has supermale syndrome, the whole family could hear his thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver said, "The doctor is just jealous that I'm a prodigy, that's why they advised you to abort! You absolutely can't abort me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm a genius, I can predict lottery numbers and help you win big!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After I earnestly explained the dangers of supermale syndrome, Grace finally had an abortion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But two days later, the lottery numbers Oliver predicted actually won.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The whole family instantly turned against me, angrily accusing me of being selfish and jealous that Grace was carrying a genius son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace completely lost her mind and grabbed a kitchen knife to kill me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When I opened my eyes again, I was reborn on the day Grace was found to be carrying a fetus with supermale syndrome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, I decided not to interfere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, you can't abort me, I'm a prodigy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can predict lottery winning numbers. If you don't believe me, buy a ticket first. If it wins in two days, you'll know if it's true."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing Oliver's inner voice, the whole family was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace hesitated for a moment and cautiously looked at her parents, Benjamin Harrison and Victoria Harrison. "Mom, Dad, did you hear that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two nodded stiffly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Victoria looked conflicted and turned to me. "Liam, do you have any suggestions?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I gently smiled at her. "You're the elder, it's up to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In my previous life, it was Benjamin and Victoria who asked me to persuade Grace to have an abortion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Grace's biological parents, they found it inconvenient to say such things, but I, as an outsider working in a hospital, knew more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But after winning the lottery, they all blamed me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Benjamin and Victoria accused me of being jealous of Grace because Fiona and I couldn't have children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona slapped me dozens of times, leaving my face swollen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace, driven to madness, grabbed a kitchen knife and killed me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I begged them for help, but all I saw were their cold and disgusted looks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this life, I won't do such things again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once a woman conceives a fetus with supermale syndrome, her body secretes a special hormone that strongly suppresses any thoughts of terminating the pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace was already unwilling to have an abortion. After hearing Oliver's words, she said, "Why don't we buy a lottery ticket first and see? What if we win?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oliver immediately got excited and said, "Mom, trust me, I'm so happy. You must stay away from Liam, he doesn't mean well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace was half-skeptical, but her gaze toward me became wary. She stepped back two steps, distancing herself from me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I ignored her, turned around, went back to the room, and started packing, preparing to file for divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona followed me in, grabbed my wrist, and said, "Even though we can hear the child's thoughts, this is too dangerous. You should still persuade Grace to have an abortion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I calmly opened the suitcase. "What's dangerous?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She got anxious. "You're a doctor, don't you know? Children with super-male syndrome are highly likely to develop severe violent tendencies as they grow up, even to the point of killing their parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grace is my sister, are you really going to stand by and do nothing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I looked at her anxious face and just found it ridiculous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In my past life, she made me persuade, but in the end, I bore all the blame alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Grace attacked me with a kitchen knife, I desperately begged them for help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They only looked on coldly, thinking I cost them the chance to win the jackpot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With my luggage packed, I picked up the suitcase and walked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I said, "I am your husband, but when it comes to Grace, I'm ultimately just an outsider. It's not my place to interfere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, didn't Oliver say it himself? He's a prodigy, maybe he really can bring you wealth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fiona then noticed the suitcase in my hand, grabbed my wrist, and frowned. "Where are you going?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Worried she might stop me, I casually said, "My mom said she's not feeling well, so I'm going home to take care of her for a few days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Oliver heard I was leaving, his voice turned sharp and piercing. "We can't let Liam go! He'll definitely find someone to force Mom to the hospital for an abortion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Quick, lock him up, don't let him leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace immediately locked the door. "Liam, wait until the lottery results are out in two days. If it's fake, I'll let you go."</p></div>
