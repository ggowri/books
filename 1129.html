  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked at Isa seriously; her brow furrowed tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't mind this arrangement? As far as I know, you're already his woman. How can you accept sharing your man with another woman, especially with your power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled lightly, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I care? You're the Goddess of Fate! Sharing a man with me is just part of destiny's plan, isn't it? I can't change fate..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa fell silent, contemplating Isa's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, she nodded slowly. "You're right; this is fate's design. The more we try to control it, the more we fear defying it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it feels so strange. I'm the Goddess of Fate, and you're the disciple of the God of Night, inheriting his powers, yet here we are, both women of Osborne. Talk about a twist of fate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but laugh at the irony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa chuckled along with her. "If you knew that Osborne's ex-wife, Ophelia, is actually </span><span>the God of Time, you'd find it even more amusing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image of Ophelia floated into Clarissa's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa froze, her eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's the God of Time? Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shrugged, her expression casual. "I've met her. So yes, I'm sure! Honestly, I was just as shocked when I found out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about her now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's voice trailed off, concern creeping into her tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's already turned me down! So, we might be down a potential ally this time around. In fact, she could become a real thorn in our side! You know how complicated her history with Osborne is; that's something he'll have to sort out on his own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's mind raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly is Osborne's identity? Does he have any normal women around him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa raised an eyebrow playfully. "Are you worried about him when we're gone? That he won't have any normal woman to take care of him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa continued calmly, "The women in his life aren't exactly what you'd call normal! His ex-wife is the God of Time, his girlfriend is the Goddess of Fate, and then there's me, a disciple of the God of Night. Plus, there's Emma, who has Death's Stare. I suspect she might be the reincarnation of the God of Death, but I can't say for sure yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget Austin, your dear friend, who's hell-bent on having his baby. If I'm right, she might be the reincarnation of the God of Life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a shame, though&mdash;she's been trying to create life but hasn't had any luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's jaw dropped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin is the reincarnation of the God of Life? Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied, "Who knows? But she's definitely on my radar. Once she breaks through to Class S, we'll know for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa frowned, asking, "So, there's not a single normal woman around Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sighed, "Yeah, as much as I hate to admit it, that seems to be the case! If I didn't know better, I'd almost think he was the reincarnation of the Goddess of Fate himself, considering all the good fortune that seems to follow him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what you're saying is that among the seven Deity Kings we fought against Lord Malevolence, the God of Night, the God of Destiny, the God of Time, the God of Death, and the God of Life have all made an appearance or left traces behind? The only ones left unaccounted for are the God of Space and the God of Light?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said, "No, it's just the God of Space we're waiting on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Light hasn't chosen to reincarnate; he's been keeping a close eye on Lord Malevolence from the ruins of Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we find the God of Space and you all regain your powers, you'll need to help him out! Otherwise, he won't last much longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was taken aback again. "So it's just the God of Space without any news? Do you think Osborne could be the reincarnation of the God of Space? I mean, he does </span><span>have spatial power..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, a wave of irritation washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, she had loathed the God of Space more than anything. If Osborne were indeed the reincarnation, she'd rather go through the cycle of reincarnation again to erase all of this life's experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa chuckled, sensing her growing unease. "Don't worry! Osborne can't possibly be the reincarnation of the God of Space; I can assure you that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he were, do you really think I'd let him be with me? You're not the only one who detests the God of Space; all the goddesses do, don't they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief washed over Clarissa, and she let out a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as Osborne isn't the reincarnation of the God of Space, I'm good! Even if he were just an ordinary guy, he's still the man of this life for me! That's a fact that can never change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I think I've got everything I need to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! Osborne must be getting impatient. Once I hand over the fate power to him, I'll leave with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a rosy blush crept across her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I wouldn't want to intrude on your special moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, this is your first time! Have fun!" Isa teased, a playful glint in her eyes before she suddenly vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa felt her cheeks flush even deeper at the thought.</span></p><div class="pagination">
