Hurry up, there are still many people waiting for you to toast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's voice rang out at this moment, and as soon as he shouted, Elliott immediately let go of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Would you like to accompany me to toast, or take a rest first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me and took the initiative to extend an invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You go ahead, I'm feeling a bit hungry, I'll find something to eat first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, wearing such a grand evening gown was really inconvenient. I would rather find a place to comfortably take a lazy break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott nodded in agreement and then he went to entertain the guests together with Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously looked around in a circle, then walked towards the dessert area. Paige appeared out of nowhere and without hesitation, she grabbed my hand and said with a cheerful smile:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you were the center of attention just now, that piano piece was amazing! I couldn't help but fall in love with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it that good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have been denied and suppressed for too long in </span><span>my</span><span> previous life, to the extent that now, I find it somewhat unbelievable about my own abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, even if Carli had played today, the result would probably be the same. Just now, many people in the audience were discussing, saying no wonder Elliott didn't take you out, he must have wanted to keep you all to himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's words were so exaggerated that I couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't lie to me anymore. How could others not know about the many rumors he spread? If he really cared about me, he wouldn't have done that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, upon hearing the words, thought I was upset, so she took my hand and solemnly said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, to be honest, Elliott was indeed a jerk before, but recently we have all noticed a change in him. It seems like he cares about you more than before. Don't you feel it yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concern? Is there any?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of attitude, he was indeed much better towards me compared to the previous two years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, this kind of goodness is still far away from what I like, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He now just feels that I am not as bad as he imagined, but as for how much he likes me, I can't feel it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he and Giselle are still an unknown factor so far, even though I successfully prevented their encounter. Who knows if they will fall in love in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I thought about this, I couldn't help but feel a little gloomy. I shook my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether he cares or not, I don't care anymore. I am now just doing whatever makes me happy, I am too lazy to bother about his thoughts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I noticed how suddenly you seemed to have become smarter, you've completely changed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paige heard me say this, she immediately said in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed and said, "Is it not good like this? In your words, there are so many men in the world, why should you have a one-sided love for him alone, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had always been trying to persuade me, especially during those years when I was infatuated with Elliott. She often felt that I was beyond help, but no matter how she tried to advise me, I never listened to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The principle that Paige has always adhered to is to seize the moment and enjoy life. She has dated many boyfriends, but she has never considered maintaining a long-term romantic relationship with any man. She believes that men are meant to make her happy, and there is no need to invest her energy and thoughts into them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So far, Paige has never truly liked anyone, and she also disdains talking about love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right to think so. Here, in recognition of how great you are now, I reward you with a piece of cake. Congratulations on escaping the sea of love and finding solid ground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige smiled and placed my favorite tiramisu in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took it from her hand with a smile, and we each held a piece of cake and happily ate it in the corner.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="55.html">« Prev</a><a href="57.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
