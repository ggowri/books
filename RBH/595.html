Unexpectedly, a slap landed on my cheek!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap came so fast and hard, leaving me no time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent my face reeling to the side, the stinging pain shooting through half of my face, a salty wetness quickly filling my nostrils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You caused Giselle to go into premature labor, yet you have the audacity to show up here! Madeline, you are a heartless woman. No matter how jealous you are of Giselle carrying Elliott's child, you shouldn't treat her like this! If anything happens to our Giselle, I would rather take my own life than let you get away with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole's accusations and insults reverberated through the entire corridor, accompanied by her wails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My ears buzzed, and it took me a moment to regain my senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held my face, slowly turning to see Nicole, who was dressed in a fur coat and a long skirt, wearing a white pearl necklace around her neck and a green gemstone ring on her finger. She lay in Toby's arms, crying her heart out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What gives you the right to hit Madeline? Giselle's premature labor was her own carelessness. What does it have to do with Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige finally snapped out of her daze. Seeing me being hit, she was ready to stand up for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for her, would Giselle have gone into premature labor? Poor grandson, he could have stayed in his mother's belly until full term, but now he's a premature baby. What are we going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole clutched her chest, launching into another heart-wrenching performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held my face, staring coldly at her theatrics, thinking, "It's her daughter who has taken something that doesn't belong to her, ruining my marriage and the bright future of the child in my belly. Yet, here she is, putting on such a show, it's infuriating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought in mind, I grabbed Nicole's wrist tightly, so tight that she cried out in pain, her voice becoming stuttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you... What are you doing? Elliott, do something about your ex-wife, she... she's too arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, as if carved from stone, stood motionless, merely saying calmly, "You were the one who struck her first without reason. I refrained from intervening out of respect for your elder status. As for how Madeline treats you, that's for her to decide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Elliott spoke, Nicole's expression suddenly changed. She probably hadn't expected Elliott to choose to protect me at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she cried out, saying, "Elliott, my daughter almost lost her life giving birth to your son! She's still in the hospital fighting for her life, how can you treat me like this for the sake of this woman? Aren't you being too heartless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked coldly at Nicole, slowly raising my hand towards her, but just as my palm was about to land on her face, suddenly, a hand grabbed my wrist.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="594.html">« Prev</a><a href="596.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
