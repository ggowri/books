Besides, I'm your husband, I can give you anything, no matter how precious. Please, just accept it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me, and before I could push him away, he had already draped the necklace around my neck.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott moved swiftly, before I could utter another word, he had already put it on me. He activated the camera on his phone and held it up to my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at that, isn't it beautiful?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but glance down at my reflection in the camera.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tiny white begonia, abstractly designed by the artist, exudes a sense of sophistication. Paired with a delicate gold chain, it hangs gracefully around the neck. It truly embodies the minimalist style I've always adored.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the weather warms up, this necklace paired with various suits looks stunning and versatile. Plus, it complements my skin tone perfectly. It's indeed tailor-made for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still felt it was inappropriate to accept Elliott's gift at this time. However, he cut me off, "It'd be a shame to throw away such a nice necklace. Just consider it as something you found. If that still doesn't sit well with you, give me a dollar and consider it a favor I did for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me earnestly, his tone surprisingly tinged with a hint of humility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would you take a dollar for this necklace?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's nonsensical remarks had me chuckling: "Well, there's really no need for such formalities."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen to me, take it. It was always meant to be yours," Elliott said. Seeing my smile, he instantly mirrored it. His words were assertive, leaving no room for refusal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the original price for this necklace? I'll pay you that." I insisted, not backing down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said coldly, "Madeline, we're husband and wife. Has it really come to this? Are you refusing just to hurt me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, please accept it. Mr. Bryant went to great lengths for this necklace, even flying to France to communicate with the designer personally. It's not about the money, it's about the thought and effort Mr. Bryant put into it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's voice floated from the front seat, his eyes meeting mine in the rearview mirror.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew he was worried. If I kept pushing and Elliott passed out from the emotional rollercoaster, we'd be in a real pickle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack had given me a call too. Although Elliott was physically okay, the fainting spell had caused the clot in his brain to enlarge a bit. Jack cautioned me to avoid upsetting Elliott as much as possible, given that the clot was pressing on a nerve and posed a significant risk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then." I didn't push any further, agreeing to it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face instantly warmed up a bit, he smiled, then took my hand, with his other hand gently turning my head to rest on his shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car swiftly arrived at Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tugged me out of the car, then cradled me towards the elevator.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene has played out between us too many times before. Now, looking back, it feels as if it was just yesterday, leaving me momentarily dazed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to get down, but he wouldn't let go. Just like that, he carried me all the way to the bedroom.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="833.html">« Prev</a><a href="835.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
