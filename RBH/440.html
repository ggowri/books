At that moment, they had completely trampled on my dignity and personality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never considered my feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this case, they were unworthy of the right to know the news, let alone deserving to be the elders of this child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would rather be a single mother than have my child be forced into the feud among me, the Bryant family, and Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After knowing I was pregnant, I was more determined to divorce Elliott. Clenching my hands tightly, I decided to hand over the divorce agreement to Elliott early tomorrow morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gradually became stable after the decision. Then, I hurried up to ask Fiona, "Fiona, do I need to do other tests? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to come over to do a B-ultrasonography tomorrow. I need to test the fetal heart and the embryo bud. Then, I will prescribe you some folic acid and prevent miscarriage medications based on your situation. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding my hands, Fiona said with a relieved and surprised look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"OK. Then I am going to return home and rest first. I'll come here tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, feeling very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really too late now, so you go back to rest quickly. Remember what I said. Don't drink anymore and stay up less late. Only if you have a good rest can the baby develop healthily. Do you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona couldn't help warning her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I answered quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While chatting, Fiona sent me to the gate of the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being in Quinn's car, I said goodbye to Fiona and Alexis. Subsequently, Quinn turned the car around and headed towards my house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was silent all the way, so he couldn't help stretching out his hand to touch my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thinking about? Are you sure you're not going to tell Elliott? I thought you would use this child to take revenge. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept my hands on my belly. I couldn't feel the baby yet, but I wanted to let him know in this way that I cared about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bryant family has a very bad attitude toward me. How can it be possible for me to use my child to please them? He is innocent. He came to this world to feel loved instead of being used as a tool to continue the bloodline!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you mean you stick to divorce Elliott? You have to think twice. If so, you will become a single mother. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said worriedly. I could clearly see the worries on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. I will divorce him. Moreover, the sooner, the better. So, what if I become a single mother? I am not afraid of it because I believe I have enough ability to raise my child to be successful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked ahead with a determined gaze. At that moment, I felt fearless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that I have this child, I would rather resolve the issues decisively between me and Elliott and separate from him as soon as possible, fearing new problems caused by pregnancy.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="439.html">« Prev</a><a href="441.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
