And I had been busy, never reaching out to him either.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although we had moved past the initial stage of our relationship, it was as if there was still a barrier between us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still couldn't bring myself to depend on him or seek his help.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subconsciously, I turned my head and saw Elliott's face, as handsome as a sculpture. The familiar scent of his cologne filled my nose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I turned my head, he leaned in, lifting my chin with one hand, and before I could react, he deeply kissed my lips...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no conversation between us. He didn't seem interested in hearing anything from me either.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips carried a faint hint of mint as they moved against mine. Then, his tongue slipped into my mouth, eagerly exploring and intertwining with mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to be urgently expressing his longing for me through his actions. But he left my mind momentarily blank as if short-circuited.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was he doing?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was in front of my dad's hospital bed!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he trying to show how much he missed me? But if that was the case, why didn't he call or message me all week?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt abrupt subconsciously. Even though I knew my dad was unconscious, I still felt uncomfortable and instinctively pushed him away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did he release me. I instinctively stood up, retreating two steps with a defensive stance, and unconsciously grasped the edge of the bedside table with both hands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My face felt flushed, and he slightly disheveled my hair</span><span>. I smoothed the stray strands behind my head and couldn't help but blurt out, "Elliott, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I doing?" He seemed puzzled by my question, his eyebrows furrowing. "Kissing my wife. Is that not allowed?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you... done?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart continued to thump. For a moment, I didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like, this past week, you haven't missed me,"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes, deep and filled with disappointment, were fixed on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head, meeting his eyes directly. I noticed the heavy weariness etched on his face. His eyes, usually bright and lively, were now tinged with redness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had he been doing this week?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did he look so tired?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I silently wondered. But outwardly, my demeanor remained indifferent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I've been busy with Glory Group matters and taking care of my dad this week. I haven't had time to think about anything else."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words clearly sparked strong displeasure in him. He immediately closed the distance between us, his gaze bearing down on me with intense pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, in your eyes, I'm just something else?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a sense of helplessness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, it seemed like, no matter what I said, Elliott could find fault with it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to never pay attention to what I said or did, but now, every word and action of mine seemed open to misinterpretation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I struggled to find the right words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I meant was, I've been really busy. My dad's been through several surgeries and still hasn't woken up. Glory Group has been chaotic. Plus, you haven't reached out to me either," I explained patiently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott still frowned deeply, his hand lifting my chin, his gaze scrutinizing me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because I've been waiting for you to reach out to me. Haven't you noticed? </span><span>You never initiate contact with me anymore</span><span>."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="309.html">« Prev</a><a href="311.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
