Madeline, when did you become like this? Weren't you the one who used to long for me to spend more time with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before was before, now is now. I believe we made it very clear that day at the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't like him bothering me like this. I thought our relationship had already ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "On that day, I expressed myself loudly and clearly enough for Elliott to hear, so why is he deliberately saying these ambiguous words to me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott leaned back in the car seat. He let out a slight sigh and pinched his nose with his hand, appearing somewhat tired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "My mom called and said you prepared gifts for them today, I thought maybe you had changed your mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did I change my mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what his words meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said lightly, "I didn't mean anything else. I just feel that we are still a couple after all, your parents have been nice to me, and it's a holiday today, so I should give them a little gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I finished speaking, Laura suddenly called me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She, like Elliott, rarely called me. In previous years, even when Elliott didn't bring me back to meet them for various reasons, they never called me proactively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the phone number, I was slightly taken aback and quickly answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, Happy Thanksgiving! Do you need something from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, thank you for the Mid-Autumn Festival gift you gave me. I really liked it. Elliott said he went with you to your parents' house, so please say hello to them for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's tone today was particularly polite, with laughter interspersed in her words, perhaps due to the effect of the gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't usually given you anything, so don't mention it. Alright, I will convey it to my parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your dad also said that the taste of this cigar is good, thank you. I just had someone deliver a box of handmade red velvet cakes to you and Elliott. Remember to have them for dinner tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura smiled on the other end of the phone and I quickly responded with a "thank you". After exchanging a few pleasantries, we hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that two ordinary gifts could make Laura so happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never given them gifts in the past. On one hand, I felt that they had everything and they might not like the gifts I gave. On the other hand, I always felt that they treated me poorly at that time, so I didn't want to give gifts to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now I gradually understand that as long as I work hard, some relationships can actually be slowly brought closer, it's just that I didn't understand it in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today is Thanksgiving, actually, we didn't have to be so serious, isn't it nice to celebrate the festival happily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Elliott suddenly said lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you want to do it like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head to look at him and noticed that he seemed a bit tired lately, his deep eyes becoming even more gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colorful lights of the street outside shone on his face, and the contours of his profile became even more perfect in the moonlight. I couldn't help but marvel at his face, </span><span>and </span><span>his figure, which were indeed impeccable and full of attraction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, don't compromise again just because of his good looks..." I almost couldn't resist, but luckily, my rationality timely reminded me in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our rooftop terrace at home was the perfect spot for moon gazing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned his head and looked at me, murmuring. His voice was gentle, making it hard for me to refuse.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="78.html">« Prev</a><a href="80.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
