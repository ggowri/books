It was from that day on, I realized you were nothing like the image I had of you. I found myself gradually drawn to you, increasingly wanting to know more about you. That's when I discovered, you're a woman of mystery, an enigma I can't quite decipher."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott drawled, his voice laced with a hint of intoxication.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice, tender and intimate, was like a lover's whisper, suddenly piercing my heart, gently stirring something within.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't see it coming, him suddenly spilling all this to me. Tonight, he was eager to share, not even waiting for my questions before he softly continued:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first time you took my breath away was when I read your diary. Before that, I knew you had feelings for me, but I had no idea how deep they ran. You documented every encounter we had, every look I gave. Yet, I had no recollection of those moments. Do you know it took me two full days to read through your diary? And after I finished, I couldn't sleep for two nights. I was moved, yes, but more than that, I felt guilt. I regretted not cherishing a woman who spent her entire youth loving me. Madeline, I'm sorry. For all the years of your youth I missed, I plan to spend the rest of my life making it up to you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, when he's had one too many, sure does become unusually chatty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I furrowed my brows at him. The depth of emotion in his eyes was so genuine, it left me stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would he suddenly say such things?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he provoked by alcohol, or had he been bottling it up for too long?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm at a loss. I don't know what to say, so I just dumbly utter, "Oh."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott still held me. I struggled, but he wouldn't let me up, murmuring again:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I can't pinpoint the exact moment I fell for you. All I know is, every time you talk about parting ways, it hurts like hell. I don't want to part from you, I want to spend the rest of my life with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Elliott spoke, his voice gradually softened, his breathing growing heavier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing up, I found him dozing off mid-sentence. Moreover, his head had unconsciously nestled into the crook of my neck.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was momentarily stunned. His words stirred a flurry in my otherwise tranquil heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've stopped reminiscing about the many things that happened between him and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his words, they stirred up memories within me. I found myself recalling a myriad of details from the past.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lowered my gaze to his sleeping face. For a fleeting moment, a pang of reluctance tugged at my heartstrings.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone who has been in unrequited love for years, I know all too well the lonely taste of a relationship where only one person is moving, one person is pursuing, and one person is desperately trying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I know, it's like Elliott and I have switched places now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, I was the one chasing after him. Now, he's the one clinging to our shared memories, refusing to let go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I posed a question to myself in my mind:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is there still a chance for Elliott and me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The question had barely formed in my mind when, in the next second, I heard a resounding answer deep within me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="784.html">« Prev</a><a href="786.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
