Elliott looked cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and walked away, hurried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Elliott left, Quinn put his arm around my shoulder and whispered, "You provoke him so cruelly? I'm afraid he can't stand it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You underestimated his powers of endurance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a sharp pain in my heart, I tried to make my tone sound relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman could be deceived by a man, and she could also be the cruelest person in the world for the sake of her beloved child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wished Elliott was disappointed in me. That way, he would stay away from my child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. No matter what you want to do, I'll help you," Quinn said in a deep voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pinched my shoulder as if he were giving me more strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only he and I knew it was only mutual support between friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Elliott suddenly turned around and glanced at Quinn and me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mistakenly believed that Quinn was intimately embracing my shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I saw his gaze turn even colder. He immediately turned his head, and soon, his tall figure disappeared at the end of the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He misunderstood us, but it was what I wanted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn withdrew his hand and shrugged helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right," I said in a low voice. "Forget it. Let's go spend some time with Paige."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I no longer thought about Elliott, shaking my head at Quinn and walking into the ward with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I pushed open the door, the scene surprised both Quinn and me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip stood guiltily next to Paige, while Paige angrily turned her head aside, refusing to look at Philip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn walked over and kicked Philip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? Are you begging for Paige's forgiveness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. If Paige doesn't forgive me, I will just stand here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip seemed to be under a spell. He would rather stand there forever than break up with Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige snorted and said, "Philip, don't pretend to be poor. I had a miscarriage, and I won't make up with you. I was foolish before, deceived by you into bed. I won't be a fool forever. Just go away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, I know I was wrong. Give me a chance to make it up to you. I can do anything for you. I promise I won't do such a thing again. Trust me one last time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip walked to the other side of the sickbed. However, Paige turned her head away, unwilling to make eye contact with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip, seeing you, I'll feel myself stupid. Put away your hypocrisy and leave quickly. Don't bother me. I want a rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Paige covered her ears, closed her eyes, and refused to talk with Philip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip would like to say more, yet Quinn pulled him out and closed the door to the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige covered her head with a blanket.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="613.html">« Prev</a><a href="615.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
