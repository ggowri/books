He was wearing a silver suit, and his cold look revealed great hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline was tired, so I just brought her here to rest. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn explained calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to talk to Madeline alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at Quinn with clear intention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's hand was originally on the doorknob. When he heard Elliott's words, he immediately retracted his hand and shrugged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, the lounge is quiet, you can just talk here. However, I hope you can chat calmly. Don't get angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This has nothing to do with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have nothing to talk about. Let's meet at the Courthouse tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Elliott's eyes, feeling very disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura already brought Giselle to attend such an event. If I hadn't embarrassed them with my strength tonight, I would have been the one who was humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had nothing to talk with him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if we did talk, it was just nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing my strong resistance, Elliott stepped forward and pushed me into the lounge without words. Immediately, he locked the door to the lounge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know everything about what happened tonight. I admit that what my mother did was wrong because she shouldn't have brought Giselle here. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed me against the door of the lounge and apologized with a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lounge was dark, with only the windows reflecting the light from outside. Elliott didn't intend to turn on the light, so I couldn't see his expression but only his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing wrong with that. Giselle has the power to control your mother. I can only blame myself for being incapable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled to myself and sounded exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, I was exhausted after a night of socializing, and I had a bad appetite, so I almost didn't eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will give Giselle a sum of compensation to let her have an abortion. Madeline, don't divorce me, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott took a deep breath as if he had made a great decision, and suddenly said in a deep voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would he let Giselle have an abortion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my head and looked at him in disbelief. He should know that Giselle's baby was important to the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he did this, Cormac and his parents might not forgive him, and they would blame it on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had been pregnant for more than five months, and the fetus had taken shape. It would be too cruel to ask her to have an abortion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. This is what the Bryant family is looking forward to most. I don't want to be your family's sinner forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought about it and shook my head firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was a little anxious, so he held my chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, then what do you want me to do?
