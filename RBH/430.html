Watching his flustered retreat, I couldn't help but smirk. It seemed that even those who were audacious were afraid of falling into traps one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, I showed Rickson those photos and videos on purpose as a favor to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could have made them public, but there was no need to. I understood better than anyone that it was better to have an ally than an extra enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was up to Rickson to make his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood at the doorway of the private room, arms crossed, watching as Rickson's figure slowly disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, even though I tried hard to drink less tonight, it seemed like my tolerance for alcohol was waning. I had barely more than a glass of red wine, yet I felt the alcohol striking me, causing an intense discomfort in my stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing something was off, I quickly made my way to the restroom. I rushed, my head spinning, and suddenly, I bumped hard into someone's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I began to apologize, but then I caught a whiff of a familiar, light, masculine scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, someone wrapped their arms around my shoulders, and I heard a familiar, concerned voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you? What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up to see Elliott standing in front of me, clad in a sleek black suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared to have been drinking. His breath carried the scent of alcohol, and a flush from the liquor slightly blurred his usually stern face. His typically cold eyes now held a touch of warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a small world. I hadn't expected to run into him here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the moment, I couldn't afford to chat, as a sharp discomfort in my stomach made me impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without time for explanations, I quickly pushed him away and dashed to the restroom sink, where I proceeded to vomit noisily into the basin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After throwing up, my severely upset stomach finally felt a bit of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strangely, I wondered if it was a stomach problem or if my health was deteriorating. Not only had my appetite worsened, but I also frequently experienced acid reflux. Sometimes, even brushing my teeth in the morning triggered retching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed after this busy period, I really needed to get a thorough health check-up at the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of confusion passed through my mind. Just then, someone from behind handed me a bottle of mineral water and two tissues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you drink so much? Who were you drinking with tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice rose again from behind me, his hand patting my back gently as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had left my suit in the private room. At the moment, I was only wearing a strapless long dress. His fingers felt ice cold on my bare skin, a touch too intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took the bottle of water, took a big gulp, and rinsed my mouth before wiping the corners of my lips with a tissue. Quickly, I stepped back to maintain a safe distance from him.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="429.html">« Prev</a><a href="431.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
