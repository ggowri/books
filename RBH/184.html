"Elliott, I never had a son in my life, just Madeline as my only daughter. When she insisted on marrying you, I must admit, I didn't feel quite right in my heart when she got married. Can you understand that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Austin, I understand," Elliott nodded, giving me a respectful glance, as if he was attentively listening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had no other demands, like money or status, they were all secondary. As long as you treat Madeline well and can often come home to see Madeline, I will be content," Austin said, patting his chest and speaking with deep emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How exactly have I been doing these past two years? Actually, my parents are the ones who know best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin had been suppressing it for too long, but today, fueled by alcohol, he finally let it all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Austin say that, I felt even more guilty in my heart as I thought about all the harm I had caused my parents in the past life for Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin, don't worry, I will treat Madeline well," Elliott looked at Austin and promised earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were sincere, giving the impression of remorse, as if he had truly realized his past shortcomings towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, is this his true feelings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he really think that, or was he just pretending to appease my parents and avoid divorcing me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, Austin, and Elliott had all had quite a bit to drink, we can't let them drink anymore. You take Elliott to your room to rest, I'll take care of things here," Lily said to me, probably afraid that Austin and Elliott would get drunk if they continued drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah? He slept in my room?" I was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Elliott has never stayed at my house or even entered my room in all the time we have been married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly wanted to stay in my room, and I immediately felt a bit uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Elliott drank so much alcohol, you help him upstairs for a nap," Lily saw me hesitate and quickly gave me a signal with her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, come on, let's go to your room and have a look," Elliott heard my conversation with Lily and without waiting for me to speak, he stood up and said to me with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This "Honey" sound gave me goosebumps all over the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him stand up, I had no choice but to get up and walk over. To my surprise, he immediately placed his hand on my shoulder and leaned towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt only the weight on my shoulders, and the strong smell of alcohol on him made me realize that he seemed to have really drunk too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have tasted this wine before. Although it is smooth on the palate, the alcohol content is not low, and it has a strong aftertaste. It is easy to drink too much when you first start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I helped Elliott up the stairs, holding his hand, with a faint smile on his lips from beginning to end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed open the door of the room, and as he entered, he was taken aback by the refreshing fragrance and the pink decorations that filled the entire room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is, after all, the room I have lived in since I was little. It was already renovated when I was very young. Later, during my growing up process, the wallpaper and furniture were changed a few times. So, even now, it still looks very new. Moreover, Lily keeps it very clean for me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="183.html">« Prev</a><a href="185.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
