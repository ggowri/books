Nicole looked at us and smiled awkwardly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know what's wrong with Giselle. She suddenly had a stomachache. Just help yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, we're eating now. Nicole, how about Giselle's relationship with her boyfriend now? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked with a smile on purpose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing my question, Nicole was a bit embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "I don't know much about young people. Giselle said they had broken up, but she didn't do anything with him. I was very strict with her in this regard. I told her that girls must not get too close to men casually."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole said it in a very detailed way, as if she was trying to clarify something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Elliott, and he seemed cold without any reaction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he said, "I heard that his family didn't want to buy a house at Hoswich, so GiselleI felt insecure. Nicole, what do you think of the house I talked about last time?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott mentioned the house again. Nicole quickly responded, "Of course that house is good. It's even too good for my family, but..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was too embarrassed to continue talking, but Elliott had already understood what she wanted to express.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said directly, "You don't have to worry about money. If you're satisfied with that house, I'll deal with the other things."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much does that house cost?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His generosity surprised me, and I asked immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Its current market price is about 5 million dollars," Elliott said in a deep voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five million dollars! I couldn't believe that he would agree to buy it for them. His generosity was the same as that of his in my previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I doubted whether Elliott was not interested in Giselle at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, I wasn't very sure about this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I became a little anxious, I put down my fork and blurted out, "Why do you want to buy them such an expensive house? What if I disagree?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I said this, Elliott darkened his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably didn't expect that I would object. After all, we had always kept our finances separate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never had the right to interfere with what he wanted to do or buy, and I was not qualified to raise objections.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle saved me before and saved Cormac this time. What's more, her father lost his life because of saving my father. Madeline, I have made the decision to buy them a house."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Nicole, Elliott's tone was very firm. It could be seen that he had made up his mind to buy this house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked into his calm eyes and felt extremely sad at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, I wouldn't have any objection if he gave a house or anything else to anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he insisted on giving it to Giselle, the woman who had ruined my marriage and hurt me deeply in my previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't accept the fact that Elliott treated her differently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was unable to continue to eat. I stared at Elliott and felt very uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked in a calm voice, "So you mean I have no right to interfere in your decision, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably felt my sadness. His lips moved as if he wanted to say something, but he didn't speak out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just reached over, grabbed my wrist, and whispered, "If you have anything to say, can we talk about it when we go back?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't lose his temper in public because of my objection, which was a huge change for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with a grudge against Giselle, I couldn't help but push his hand away. I turned my head and was overwhelmed by my grievance.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="219.html">« Prev</a><a href="221.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
