Giselle was the chosen wife for Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my previous life, I always found it puzzling. Giselle came from humble beginnings with nothing to her name. Even with all her cunning, how could she have gained the full support of the entire Bryant family in such a short time? Today, everything became clear to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Over the years, with the Bryant family's support, Giselle has excelled in her studies and played the piano well. I vaguely remember in my previous life, Giselle seemed to be fluent in multiple languages and assisted Elliott in completing numerous complex international transactions. Without sufficient financial backing for her education, it would have been nearly impossible to achieve all that through self-study alone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Elliott was so furious when he saw her with Rowan at the bar that day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Giselle is indeed the carefully groomed choice of his family, then in Elliott's eyes, her actions with Rowan meant sacrilege."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, I seemed to understand the kind of feelings Elliott harbored for Giselle. For a moment, my mind buzzed with confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For so many years, I would be welcomed at the Bryant Villa every holiday. Elliott and I grew up together. Each year, he would meticulously prepare birthday gifts for me. Not only that, Elliott himself said he would take care of me for a lifetime. I bet you never experienced any of that, did you? Believe me, in Elliott's heart, I will always be an indispensable part of his life, while you, forever optional."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle probably thought she had successfully broken me down, so she continued to lean in close to my ear, speaking in the gentlest tone while delivering the harshest words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words struck me hard, and for a moment, I couldn't accept this reality, feeling only endless despair and struggling to stay steady.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Giselle, having found my weak spot, was relentless. She continued to draw closer, slowly revealing a shocking truth to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know? On my eighteenth birthday, Elliott took my first kiss. Yes, it was on the day before your wedding."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle intentionally blinked her seemingly innocent eyes, recounting those despair-inducing facts to me, one after the other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That day, Elliott told me that marrying a woman he didn't love was truly painful. He said he had waited for me for so many years, finally seeing me grow up, but now, because of you, he could only see me as family. Elliott said he was particularly saddened, and he promised to do everything to make me happy in the future. You probably didn't know any of this, did you? This is a secret between Elliott and me, something he would never tell you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was flustered at that moment. Looking at Giselle in front of me, I was repeatedly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected she would choose today, this moment, to suddenly divulge so much to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I desperately tried to convince myself that none of this was true, just Giselle's ploy to defeat me. But as I recalled Elliott's ambiguous attitude towards Giselle, the exquisite gowns he meticulously prepared for her, and the affection shown by all the members of the Bryant family towards her, everything Giselle said seemed all too real.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="252.html">« Prev</a><a href="254.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
