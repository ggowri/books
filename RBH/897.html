I chuckled and teased in jest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've arrived just in time. Jane has just finished making some Gastrodin Chicken Soup. You should have some too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus responded as naturally as if he and Jane were already lovers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's at your place making soup this late, you two..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled with a hint of ambiguity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shy Marcus instantly felt awkward, while Jane emerged with ease. Wiping her hands on her apron, she greeted me with a smile:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, I just flew in this afternoon from Edulet City. I brought some fresh gastrodin to make a healing soup for Marcus. You've arrived just in time. Please, have a seat. I'll bring the soup over!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, awesome! I'll just go with the flow and follow the master's plan then."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, saying with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hurried into the kitchen, assisting Jane with ladling the soup. I watched them, their synergy and affection for each other was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't pry any further. After all, they both were incredibly discreet. If I were too blunt, it would just make them uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I plopped down and cut straight to the chase with Marcus:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I came to you today because I need a favor. Money is no object."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spill it. What's going on?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me so serious and coming to him so late, Marcus knew something must be up. So, he immediately asked me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Lisa, she's definitely into witchcraft. I need to protect myself, and I want you to find me an expert from Marcus's side. Find a way I can defend myself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh," Marcus paused, glancing at Jane, "One of Jane's pals hails from Norch City, home to a renowned specialist in this field. Jane, lend Madeline a hand, will you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, ever since Marcus mentioned it to me last time, I've been brainstorming solutions for you. This time, I specifically asked my friend to have a doctor concoct a potion. If it's just a common spell, a spritz of this potion into the caster's eyes should break it instantly. I've brought the potion back with me, let me fetch it for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane dashed over to her backpack, rummaged through it, and handed me a potion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This potion is housed in a dark bottle, its consistency thick and gooey. I'm clueless as to what it's made of, and it carries a peculiar scent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I trusted Jane and Marcus. So, without further questions, I accepted the potion they offered. Then, I turned to Jane and asked:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, how much for the potion? I'll pay you, have the doctor brew a few more bottles. I'm afraid, she might harm others around me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said to Jane.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="896.html">« Prev</a><a href="898.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
