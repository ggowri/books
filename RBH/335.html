Are you a kid or something?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me, disbelief in his eyes. Suddenly, he bit my other earlobe, hard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anger that had charged the air between us vanished, replaced by an unspoken tension.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That bite shifted something in his gaze. Now, as I stared up at his handsome face, I could clearly see his eyes clouded with a hazy desire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instinctively looked down at my chest...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately glanced down. My neckline was wide open, revealing more than I intended. I instantly understood why his attitude had changed so abruptly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly covered my chest, my cheeks burning. "So, you're saying Giselle is lying?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even need to ask?" He wrapped his hand around my waist and pulled me hard against him. The neckline I had been clutching at gaped even wider. He suddenly leaned close to my ear and whispered in a low, magnetic voice, "Can't you feel it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" I screamed in my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could handle Elliott being cold and distant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he seemed to change his attitude, using such a charming tone and manner to seduce me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I desperately tried to cover my neckline, but his hands were tightly wrapped around my waist, pulling my clothes to the breaking point.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to confront him, but clearly, his focus was no longer on the problem.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, I could distinctly feel a formidable energy awakening within him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, would you please let go?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this was going the wrong way, I shouted at the top of my lungs, struggling to break free from his grasp.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott had no intention of letting me go. His hands wandered under my clothes. Suddenly, his lips fiercely sealed mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, hmm..." I pounded on his chest, trying to say something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed eager to claim his territory, giving me no room to breathe. "You are mine!" he growled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed me hard against the railing. The waves roared even louder at that moment, and the deserted coastal road gave Elliott the confidence to make bold moves.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kissed me wildly, with no intention of stopping.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if he wanted to mark every part of me, he pressed forcefully as though he wanted to fuse me to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the sounds I made meant nothing against his desire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole world seemed to hush, leaving only us beneath the vast sky. Elliott had no intention of stopping...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he tried every possible way to remove the last piece of my clothes, my remaining sanity was thin. "Are you crazy? Here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You belong to me, Madeline."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clearly had lost even that last bit of rationality. He bit my earlobe hard again, and then, in the deep, dark night, the groan of the railing against our weight filled the night...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="334.html">« Prev</a><a href="336.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
