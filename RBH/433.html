Elliott must have felt my resolve as he stared intently into my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly do you want me to do? You want me to force her to abort the child? Life is innocent, Madeline! I can't do such a thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were bloodshot, his voice deep and tinged with profound helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But from his words, I sensed his budding compassion for Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Good. This was what Giselle wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she couldn't have his heart, she could use the child to slowly gain his sympathy and love, gradually capturing his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then stay away from me! Stop acting like a lovesick puppy around me, Elliott. I am not your tool for relieving your desire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I grabbed his collar, unable to hold back a growl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stared at me in disbelief, still puzzled by my coldness toward him. Far from letting go, he cupped my face, and his eyes were affectionate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relieve my desire? I can hardly believe such words would come from you! Weren't you happy with me before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was happy before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a woman who had never known pleasure, Elliott's recent frenzy was something I couldn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But any joy involving another woman became worthless in an instant, utterly obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a woman who could not tolerate flaws in love. I could not accept a love triangle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tugged at the corner of my lips, a bitter smile forming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think that kind of happiness will still exist after you have a child with Giselle? Elliott, if you were in my shoes, would you be happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's lips moved, and he looked at me. His gaze shifted and he paused as if he harbored an unspeakable secret. I could sense his struggle to speak, yet he hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he confessed, "The matter of the child truly has nothing to do with me. It was all orchestrated by my grandparents and my parents. Should I be held responsible for that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cormac, Laura, and Jasper designed this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't understand the meaning of this sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They planned a pregnancy for Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?" I asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott bowed his head and took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you remember that time Grandpa forced us to go for a physical examination?" Elliott asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The physical examination?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, I remembered. I couldn't possibly forget it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The humiliation of that day was still vivid in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I remember. But what does this have to do with the physical examination?" I asked, puzzled.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="432.html">« Prev</a><a href="434.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
