He had put on quite a bit of weight and had an air of desolation about him. His hair and clothes were no longer meticulously chosen, but rather, he seemed to have adopted a carefree approach to his appearance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Contrarily, Alexis seemed to be more spirited than ever. His eyes, though not large, were full of life. He exuded a powerful aura of a lawyer, demanding respect and attention.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip and Alexis took their seats.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They first glanced at me, a hint of surprise in their eyes, then turned to Lisa, their surprise escalating instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry had already filled them in on Elliott's previous injury and memory loss. So, they understood why I was sticking close to Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their gazes seemed foreign to Lisa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott introduced the trio to each other. Afterward, Alexis nodded and said, "Ms. Fox and Madeline could easily be mistaken for sisters. They look so alike."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this vast world, it's not uncommon to stumble upon someone who looks strikingly similar to another. Remember that news story a while back? About a waiter who was a dead ringer for that hotshot celebrity? But, even though they shared the same face, their auras were worlds apart." Lisa lifted her glass in a toast to Alexis, before continuing her tale.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had gradually grown accustomed to the fact that Lisa and I looked alike. Hearing her words, I couldn't help but chuckle lightly, "The Ugly Duckling and the Swan may look alike, but there's always a difference. Who's the Ugly Duckling and who's the Swan, anyone with clear sight can tell at a glance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I won't stay silent and endure anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone pisses me off, I won't hesitate to call them out, regardless of the situation or saving face. As for what others think or say about me, I couldn't care less.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All that matters is my own happiness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words instantly infuriated Lisa. She scoffed at me, asking, "So, according to Ms. Mayers, who's the ugly duckling and who's the swan between us?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Lisa uttered those words, the atmosphere in the room turned incredibly awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, an awkward expression crossed the faces of the three gentlemen. Everyone could feel the tension between Lisa and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The seafood here is pretty good, all netted up fresh. Give it a try." Elliott smoothly changed the subject.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis popped a shrimp into her mouth, remarking, "Mmm, it's indeed fresh. Ladies, why don't you give it a try?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't move, yet, Elliott slid a piece of fish onto my plate. He murmured, "This fish is deep-sea caught, the flesh is incredibly tender, the best you can find on the market right now. Give it a try, Madeline."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, taking a bite. Indeed, the meat was incredibly fresh and tender.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott placed a cooked shrimp onto Lisa's plate, "Ms. Fox, this shrimp is quite tasty. I know you don't get much fresh seafood where you're from, so you should give it a try. There's a particular way to eat it. Philip, would you show Ms. Fox how it's done?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott shot Philip a knowing glance, and in an instant, Philip caught on, immediately starting to demonstrate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He jabbed his fork directly into the shrimp's belly, swiftly shedding its shell and revealing the freshest meat inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Lisa merely smirked, making no move. She flashed a small smile at me, "Ms. Mayers, you haven't answered my question yet."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere, which had just been eased by Elliott, instantly stiffened once again.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="829.html">« Prev</a><a href="831.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
