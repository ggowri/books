I asked directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, thank you, Ms. Mayers. After the funds were received, we immediately started the next filming process. Currently, everything is going smoothly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Dalton, I want to ask you something. You mentioned earlier that filming this movie has affected certain people's interests. I'm curious, who are these certain people you're referring to? Can you tell me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, have you received any messages?" Dalton became instantly alert when he heard me say that. "Has someone called you and threatened you? Ms. Mayers, don't be afraid. As long as you stay in Hoswich City, these people won't be able to harm you at all. After all, our country is a legal society."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am not in Hoswich City right now, I have come to Norch City. Dalton, I'll be honest with you, my best friend has been suddenly kidnapped and I have no idea where he is. All I know at the moment is that all of this may be related to an organization called the 731 Group in Mexico. Tell me, the group you offended, is it the 731 Group?" I asked straightforwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is not the 731 Group, however, it is a much more powerful force than the 731 Group. They appear to be a conglomerate, but in reality, they are involved in illegal activities. Some plot points in my film reveal some insider information about this group, so I have been targeted and retaliated against by them. Ms. Mayers, why did you suddenly go to Norch City? Why was your friend kidnapped?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton informed me of the situation in more detail, and then he curiously asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I don't have time to explain more now, I just want to know the inside story about the 731 Group. Dalton, can you confirm that the 731 Group has no connection with the underworld group that you offended?" I asked urgently over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To my knowledge, they had no direct contact. Ms. Mayers, if your friend was kidnapped by this force, then they should have no connection to us. I have some friends in Mexico, and if you can provide me with specific information about your friend, I can try to see if I can be of any assistance to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It appears that Quinn was suddenly kidnapped, and it seems to have little to do with my investment in Dalton's movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that's the case, why did Delin suddenly turn so vicious toward Dalton?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did they really have the intention to get that ten million dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remained very confused. After providing him with all of Quinn's information, I hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, after we got off the highway 0.6 miles ahead, we will be arriving at Ruini," Jane suddenly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I heard that we were getting closer and closer to the final destination, I couldn't help but feel nervous in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is said that Ruini shares borders with Mexico on three sides, so it has a strong trade relationship with Mexico. Because of this, the procedures for entering and exiting the country are extremely simple. Many people frequently travel back and forth between the two countries for the purpose of trade, so there are also many secret transactions </span><span>taking place in secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We currently haven't obtained enough information, so once we arrive at Ruini, it means that we will be facing unknown dangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in order to rescue Quinn, we had no choice but to temporarily follow what they said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane quickly drove onto the ramp and not long after, we exited the highway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as we exited the highway intersection, I noticed a white commercial van on the side of the road that immediately accelerated and quickly followed behind us.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="735.html">« Prev</a><a href="737.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
