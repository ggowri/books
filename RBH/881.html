It was the sound of thunder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was terrified, unable to help myself, I covered my ears and let out a piercing scream.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. Don't be scared, I'm here. Madeline, did you have a nightmare?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was patting my back gently, as if soothing a child. His voice was incredibly soft.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it was terrifying. I dreamt of you, covered in blood."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a slight nod, curling up in fear within Elliott's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dream was too real, so real it felt like it actually happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden jolt, a thought struck me. Swiftly, I yanked open Elliott's shirt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, the skin on his upper body was impeccably smooth. Not a single wrinkle, let alone a scar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, upon closer inspection, Madeline found that his upper body was indeed marred with numerous scars, reminiscent of centipedes. These scars had clearly been treated medically and were not immediately noticeable. At first glance, one wouldn't see them, but upon closer examination, his body bore many scars.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I recall when we divorced, he didn't have these scars on him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could these scars be the remnants of that time in Ruini when he saved me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that the dream was real? He took numerous slashes just to save me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, I was utterly flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The thunder outside must have scared you, causing those nightmares. I'll stay with you, there might be more thunder and lightning later."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, Elliott promptly kicked off his slippers and climbed into bed. Still dressed, he lay down next to me, and I continued to rest in the crook of his arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, I drifted off to sleep again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have to admit, having him sleep next to me does bring a certain sense of comfort.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The following afternoon, I rang up Barry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Barry's lips, I confirmed that the dream I had last night could very well be a genuine memory, buried deep within my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Barry found him, Elliott had indeed been slashed numerous times. He was drenched in blood, barely clinging to life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he not been prepared, wearing a vest stitched from special material, Barry would have arrived to find him already dead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After uncovering the truth, I slumped over my desk, sinking into a prolonged silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, my phone started to ring. Glancing at the caller ID, it was Grey.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter, Auntie Grey?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, my husband is planning a golf tournament this weekend. It's going to be a star-studded event. Your ex-husband isn't on the guest list, but would you like to come? It could be a good opportunity to network."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey is truly warm towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this also indicates that the power of Glory Group is not underestimated by the elite circle of Hoswich City.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I'm free this weekend."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, I was pondering over an excuse to limit my weekend encounters with Elliott. Now, the opportunity has presented itself. Of course, I'm going to take it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew it, you'd want to come. So, doll yourself up a bit, see you this weekend."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sweet tone, Grey finished speaking and promptly hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've circled the date on my desk calendar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, I planned to swing by the local sportswear shop after work to snag a fitting workout outfit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to my surprise, as soon as I reached the bottom of the stairs, there was Elliott, already waiting for me. And what's more, he had changed into a brand-new, high-end spring suit. He looked incredibly handsome and sophisticated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't I tell you not to come pick me up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stepped forward, speaking with a touch of awkwardness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I managed to get off work early today, and I thought we could go shopping. Maybe pick out a few outfits for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's as if he saw right through me, Elliott actually proposed this...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="880.html">« Prev</a><a href="882.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
