We are greeted with extreme enthusiasm by the store managers and staff.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surely, due to my actions, pretty much every store has a beautiful clerk shedding tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott splurged on a bunch of outfits for me all at once. They were all the latest seasonal styles, and even limited editions. Each set had its own unique charm, expensive, yet stunning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I relish in it, guilt-free, without a shred of remorse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've given him the best years of my youth, it's only right that he buys me a few outfits. Even if he buys me more, I wouldn't feel guilty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After shopping for clothes, we passed by a branded bag store. Elliott, ever the gentleman, led me inside and treated me to a limited edition handbag.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can tell, anything I fancy, Elliott would buy it for me. He doesn't care about the price now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We dropped hundreds of thousands of dollars in a few stores, but he didn't bat an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His swipe of the card was so suave, it gave me a taste of what generosity truly means.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I've made a lot of money now, I've never spent it like this before. After all, it hurts to spend my own money.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's actions today gave me a taste of the thrill that comes with being pampered by a man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finally get why so many women prefer not to work and dream of marrying into wealth. Indeed, the thrill of spending money brings joy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Elliott indeed bought my happiness with money.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a bit dismissive of him before, but after buying all these stuff, I'm genuinely thrilled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Feeling peckish? Let me take you to my favorite spot for some secret menu delights."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the contented smile on my face, Elliott was particularly pleased. He draped his arm around my shoulders, leading me with a spring in our steps towards a shop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This eatery is staffed exclusively with top-tier private chefs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once we stepped in, we had a chef attending to us on a one-on-one basis.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott picked out our dishes from the menu, and the chef, right in front of us, started preparing our food behind a glass partition.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the ingredients were top-notch fresh, and the chef's knife skills and techniques were first-rate. We chatted away, watching as the chef continuously transformed these ingredients into uniquely delicious dishes, served right before our eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meal, it's not just the ingredients that are top-notch, but the service too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole establishment seemed to cater solely to us. From the moment we stepped in, no other patrons made an appearance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the store manager personally played the role of our server, providing us with exclusive service.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The store manager showed immense respect towards Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a deep satisfaction with the food, a joy that bubbled up inside me, prompting an uncontrollable chuckle:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never knew before, you're such a mall rat, so adept at enjoying life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't smoke, I don't drink, and I'm not into women. If I didn't have any other hobbies, wouldn't life be dreadfully dull?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott set down his fork and knife, gracefully dabbing at his lips before flashing me a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True, it seems I know too little about you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found myself laughing too. Today, I realized I didn't know Elliott at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You always rush to judge me before you even get to know me. There must be a reason why so many women are attracted to your husband, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott winked at me, grinning with a sense of triumph.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never seen him so full of life before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's no longer the guy who'd put on a cool facade in front of me on purpose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right. Tell me, how many women are into you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="883.html">« Prev</a><a href="885.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
