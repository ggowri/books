Don't worry. I'll be here right away. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't show indifference but was concerned. So, I immediately told him the hospital I was in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About twenty minutes passed, and Elliott came in a hurry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was obviously at work just now. He was now followed by his assistant Barry. Wearing a gray suit, he looked dominating. However, he was probably in a hurry, as there was sweat on his forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he saw me, he immediately stepped forward and held my shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Austin now? Is he okay? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The operation was successful, but he is still in the intensive care unit. The doctor said he is still in a coma."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He now looked worried, different from being indifferent when he was in the Bryant hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, I was a little confused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately looked around. Seeing Lily crying in sadness, he comforted her with a few more words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, Fiona and Paige were all still in place. Quinn saw this, patted his shoulder, and said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. Fortunately, the operation was successful. Your father should be able to wake up soon according to the doctors' words."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked up suddenly as if he just realized Quinn was also there. He looked at Quinn in disbelief, immediately frowned, and asked,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't know how to answer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly said subconsciously,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was me who called Quinn. I was afraid that my mother would be too emotional, so I asked him to pick her up and bring her to the hospital. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't realize there was anything wrong with that. However, Elliott's eyes widened even more when he heard this. He looked at me in disbelief,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, when something happens to your dad, you give Quinn a call instead of me? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was speechless and didn't know how to answer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remember he asked me to leave indifferently in the Bryant hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Cormac was also in danger. If I called him rashly, I didn't know if he will be angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere at the scene suddenly became awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, at this time, Fiona interjected.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is normal. You are so busy and not as idle as Quinn. Madeline was worried about disturbing you, so she contacted Quinn."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's words did not let Elliott's expression soften. He still looked at me with a frown and then pulled me aside without saying a word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Quinn mean more in your heart than me? When something happened to Austin, you should think of me first, right? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He obviously couldn't accept it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cormac was seriously ill, so I am afraid that you will be too busy. Besides, I was not sure if you were with your family. If my phone call irritates your family again, I will feel guilty. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my head to meet his eyes, and calmly explained myself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is not an acceptable reason. It means that subconsciously, you trust Quinn more than me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="295.html">« Prev</a><a href="297.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
