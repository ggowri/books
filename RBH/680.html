I rushed forward and grabbed Elliott by the collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, did you actually hit her? Didn't you see that her face was already injured?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know if she said something to you that made you so distant toward me now, but I can tell you for sure that between her and me, it was all just an act. The person I truly liked from the beginning to the end was only you, do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Elliott transferred his anger to Sylvia, mistakenly thinking that Sylvia said something to me, which caused a change in my attitude toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I believe that even though we are not in a romantic relationship, you should know my character. I have not said anything negative about you to Madeline. If you don't believe me, you can ask Madeline!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia covered her face and tears kept flowing. She bit her lip and looked at Elliott, her gaze revealing a hidden anger and, also, love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She always told me that it was all an act between you and her. Elliott, you should </span><span>look for reasons within yourself more, rather than attributing mistakes to others!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Sylvia's face, feeling both heartbroken and indescribably angry inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at us, wanting to say something, but in the end, he didn't say anything more. He just smiled self-deprecatingly and then turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did Elliott become like this now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia watched Elliott's figure and felt the same sense of incredulity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps it was the passing of his grandfather, along with some recent events, that made him become like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn sighed and said with some resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you okay? Does it hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I withdrew my gaze and then quickly turned to ask Sylvia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, he didn't hit me hard, but this slap, he didn't leave any trace of affection at all. If it were someone else, I would never have let it go like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia smiled bitterly, covering her face as she spoke. In her tone, there was still a lingering affection for Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you truly like him in the past?" I couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I was a star. Back then, if I didn't genuinely like him, how could I have been willing to accompany him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, back then he took you wherever he went."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia's words also brought back those unpleasant memories from the past. It reminded me of how little Elliott actually cared about me back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said some things, don't be angry. At that time, he really didn't care about you. When I was with him, he found your calls annoying and resisted talking about anything related to you. At that time, I could clearly feel that he didn't love you, but I don't know why he cares about you so much now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia probably felt that our relationship had improved, so she didn't hesitate to talk to me about these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"People are probably like this, they don't know how to cherish what they have, and only realize their regrets when they lose it. However, there is simply no regret medicine in this world."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="679.html">« Prev</a><a href="681.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
