She rushed over immediately, held my shoulder, and asked, "He was still being rescued inside, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I saw Jade and Tom appear, I felt confused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad's car accident happened suddenly, I didn't notify anyone of the Glory Group, and Jade didn't call me, how could she know that my dad was in this hospital?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The police called the front desk of the company. When we heard the news, we rushed over immediately. Is Mr. Mayers still rescuing him? Is he in danger?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade looked extremely concerned. She looked anxiously at the door of the operating room. It seemed as if she was really worried about my father.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for some reason, I had a strong instinct that the reason for this car accident was complicated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First of all, my dad was an experienced driver. He drove cautiously and rarely got scratched on his car for so many years, let alone having such a serious accident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Secondly, my dad often drove on that road. He often visits the golf course. Moreover, the road where the accident happened was very wide. How could such an accident happen suddenly?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is still in the process of rescuing, and we don't know the situation yet. Jade, don't you have to deal with the work in the company now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked on purpose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how busy I am, I still worry about Mr. Mayers' safety. I advised him a few days ago that he is getting old now and should let the driver sent him, but he didn't listen."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade sighed. At this time, Tom who came with her also said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, the weather is gloomy today. I guess your dad's vision is not very good while driving. Otherwise, how could such an accident happen?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed to be concerned, but for some reason, I always felt that something was not right.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the green light in the emergency room finally turned on. Seeing this, we all immediately rushed towards the door of the emergency room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad was pushed out of the emergency room by doctors and nurses. The attending doctor took off his mask and said to us,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The patient is out of danger for the time being. However, there is a blood clot in his brand, which may cause a coma. He still needs to be observed in the intensive care unit for some time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing the news that my father was temporarily out of danger, my heart calmed down a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When my mother heard this, she burst into tears again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Thank God. Thank those doctors!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We sent my dad to the door of the intensive care unit. Seeing my originally healthy father suddenly having his head covered with gauze and his body covered with various instruments and tubes, I felt heartbroken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching him being sent to the intensive care unit, I silently wiped the tears from my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at this time, Elliott called me. When I saw his name, I suddenly burst into tears as if I suddenly became extremely fragile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the call was connected, before I could speak, I found myself sobbing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Madeline, what happened? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott still didn't know what happened. After he heard me sobbing, his voice suddenly sounded louder.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="294.html">« Prev</a><a href="296.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
