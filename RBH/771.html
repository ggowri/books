Could it be that he wasn't waking up, but under some kind of spell?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just like that, Laura had walked in, stumbling upon the scene by sheer coincidence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for my now formidable aura, sharp reflexes, and the knowledge of surveillance in the sickroom, I would have been at a loss to explain the recent situation, even if I had ten mouths to talk with.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would believe that Elliott, still deep in slumber, could suddenly transform like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others would only think I was deliberately enticing Elliott, as Laura put it, desperate and thirsty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, I felt a sense of dread.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively glance back in that direction. However, Lisa, who was just smoking in the corner, has vanished. It's as if she was never there in the first place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth is this elusive Lisa up to?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth is she scheming, sticking so close to Elliott like this?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she really does have some sort of special treatment method, and she does something shady to Elliott, then he's definitely in danger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, I, who initially wanted to leave, halted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you leaving? Well, go on then. What are you waiting for? Why haven't you left yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me suddenly halt, Laura planted her hands on her hips and hollered from behind me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head, refusing to engage with this ignorant and crazed old woman. I pushed open the door to the hospital room, taking a seat by Elliott's bedside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you back again? Get out of here, why aren't you leaving?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura came chasing after me, buzzing in my ear like a pesky mosquito. However, with one glare from me, she shivered in fear, not daring to come any closer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not leaving. I'm staying by his side until he wakes up. Go get the doctor now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said to her, coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you leaving? Weren't you all high and mighty just a moment ago? Didn't you say you were over Elliott? You..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Keep yapping and I'll rip your mouth off!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shot her a fierce glare, startling her into another shiver.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why... why are you talking to me like this? Why should I listen to you? Madeline, let me tell you, I... I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura still wanted to bluff.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rose from my chair, closing the distance between us in an instant, hitting her with another lethal glance. Then, I quickly scanned the surroundings, lowering my voice to a whisper:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott's reaction just now was way off, like he's been hexed or something. If you don't want him to kick the bucket prematurely, you better listen to me and fetch the doc, pronto! Go!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Laura shivered twice in succession.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her mouth, ready to act tough. However, with just one look from me, she sulkily shut it again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She might be a bit dim, but she's not beyond redemption. At my words, something clicked in her. Reluctantly, she scurried out of the sickroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, I heard her frantic cries for a doctor echoing down the hallway.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="770.html">« Prev</a><a href="772.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
