Due to people returning home, it quickly spread from individual provinces to the entire country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how far Elliott and Marcus got in their last collaboration. Now, Marcus is my neighbor. I must make good use of this opportunity to expedite collaboration with Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said, "We already have our own production workshop. Do I still need to stock up? I've already had our workers work overtime to produce masks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I winked mischievously at Quinn. At that moment, he seemed to understand something and smiled, "It seems like you and I both have foresight. Madeline, do you think we were enemies in our past lives?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's casually spoken words made my heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Past lives. Why would he suddenly bring that up? And especially while we were just discussing the virus and masks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him, stunned, unable to speak. Seeing me frozen, Quinn mischievously snatched my hat off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just teasing you. Look at you taking things so seriously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he deliberately tousled my hair, pushed the cart, and ran off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, damn it! Give it back to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately chased after him, cursing as I ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being with Quinn, I found that I could really let my guard down completely, almost like turning back into a carefree kid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We goofed around in the supermarket for a while. Finally, we managed to gather all the groceries my mother wanted us to pick up, and then we headed back to my place together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I helped my mother cook while Quinn sat in the living room with my father, watching the news and chatting about current events. Before long, my mother had prepared a feast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the food was ready, the doorbell rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurried over to answer it, only to find Marcus standing there, holding two bottles of wine and smiling at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said to come over for food, so here I am, shamelessly showing up. It's been so many years since I've had Lily's cooking. I've been missing it. I hope I'm not intruding?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not. You're right on time. We were just about to eat," I smiled, quickly ushering Marcus inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years had passed. My parents were pleasantly surprised to see Marcus and hurriedly invited him to sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My father couldn't have alcohol. To everyone's surprise, my mother joined Quinn and Marcus that afternoon for a drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We gathered together at the end of the year, and the atmosphere was particularly relaxed and harmonious, making this meal feel meaningful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because it was our first day in the new house, I took a few photos and posted them on Instagram without thinking much about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't capture Quinn and Marcus in the photos, just the delicious food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What I didn't expect was that after posting the photos on Instagram, Elliott called me within less than a minute.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="423.html">« Prev</a><a href="425.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
