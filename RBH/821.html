Are you feeling any better?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't open his eyes, yet, he held my hand tightly. Soon after, his furrowed brow relaxed. Before long, the sound of his steady breathing filled the air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems, the sound he just made was likely sleep talking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a sleepless night, I was truly exhausted. I propped my chin up, gazing at Elliott, and before I knew it, I had dozed off on the edge of the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time I regained consciousness, it was already the following morning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I opened my eyes, I found myself mysteriously relocated to a hospital bed. Not only was I tucked under a blanket, but also, draped over me was Elliott's suit jacket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This little hospital is rather basic, hence the rooms lack air conditioning. Although the climate here is pleasant, it still gets a bit chilly during the wee hours and at dawn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw Elliott, clad only in a thin shirt, perched on the couch across from the sickbed, his hand propping up his chin. I couldn't tell if he was asleep or not.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did he end up giving me the bed, while he himself settled for the chair?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that he couldn't bear to see me sleeping hunched over after he woke up in the middle of the night?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I must have been utterly exhausted, for I didn't even stir when he lifted me onto the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, why are you sitting over there? Get back in bed, pronto."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing he was still a patient, I quickly got up, approached him, and gave his arm a gentle nudge.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott jolted awake. A satisfied smirk played on his lips as he caught sight of me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, had a good sleep last night. You awake? Feeling hungry? I've sent Barry out for breakfast. We can eat in a bit."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even realize you passed out last night? Why wouldn't you just stay in bed? Why did you insist on giving it up for me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but voice my complaints. Especially when I saw the faint dark circles around his eyes, my heart ached even more for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. Just sorry to have put you through this. Madeline, you still care for me. That's comforting."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's eyes gazed at me with a gentle warmth. His voice was unusually raspy, carrying a magical penetrating power that echoed within the confines of this small hospital bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback. Just as I was about to defend myself, Barry had already pushed the door open and walked in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was holding a few cups of cola and some burgers in his hands:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, this is about all I could find around here. I noticed this place was pretty popular, so I grabbed some burgers. Give them a try."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Feeling hungry? Here, let me feed you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott took the burger and cola from Barry's hand, he picked up a burger and brought it to my lips first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't eaten much last night, and after a night of hustle and bustle, I was famished. At this very moment, the rich aroma of the hamburger was particularly enticing, leading me to take an involuntary bite.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected this burger to be so incredibly delicious. Not only was the patty thick and juicy, but the flavor was also out of this world. I couldn't help but exclaim:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This burger is insanely delicious&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is nothing more than a commonplace compliment. Moreover, I'm not even praising anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it was as if Elliott had suddenly received the highest honor, his face instantly filled with profound joy. And, in a rare moment, he flashed a brilliant white smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being in his thirties, his smile was as radiant as a teenager's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could utter another word, he was already pushing the burger towards my mouth again. His voice was as soft as a whisper:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tastes good, huh? Dig in, have some more. If it's not enough, I'll send Barry out to get more&mdash;"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="820.html">« Prev</a><a href="822.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
