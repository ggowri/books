In the end, the four of us were fine. However, Fiona, who had been always reasonable, were drunk and couldn't stand up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know whether Philip or Quinn had called Alexis. Just as we were about to leave, Alexis rushed to the club.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis still wore their firm's exclusive lawyer uniform and was very elegant, but he looked a little tired. He said he had just settled an international economic dispute and got off the plane an hour ago.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Fiona lying on the sofa, Alexis felt distressed and punched Philip and Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with you? How could you let Fiona drink so much? Did you trick her because I wasn't around?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were all willing to play games tonight. Fiona was unlucky and lost. It's not our fault."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn took the punch with a smile and defended us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, tomorrow is the weekend. Otherwise, how could she do the surgery tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis blamed them, then stepped forward and brushed the hair away from Fiona's face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked softly, "Fiona, are you okay? I'm Alexis. I'll take you home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona had been sleeping on the sofa for a while. Probably because she had heard Alexis's voice, she opened her eyes in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't think you would return tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I happened to catch the last flight of the day. Come on. I'll carry you back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis helped her up without saying anything more. We quickly stepped forward and put Fiona on Alexis's back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexis, I'll leave Fiona to you. You have to send her home safely," I said with worry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I had known Alexis for so long and knew what kind of person he was. He was an upright lawyer and not a villain who took advantage of others. Therefore, I was not worried he would do something to Fiona.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis smiled at me and left the club, carrying Fiona on his back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the four of us also left one after another. Paige said she hadn't had enough fun and wanted to go to the bar. Philip readily agreed to accompany her there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I drank a lot and wasn't as playful as Paige. I said I wanted to go home, and Quinn said he would see me off. So, the four of us parted ways.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The club was near my neighborhood and about one mile from my home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I walked out of the club, a cool breeze blew in, which made me sober after just finishing my drink.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about we walk to your house and have a midnight walk?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked around. Although it was midnight, it was brightly lit in a big city like Hoswich. Moreover, there was a bright moon tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," I readily agreed and walked forward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still wore the sportswear I wore when I went hiking with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't feel cold in this outfit during the day, but at midnight, when the wind blew, I couldn't help but shiver.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Quinn suddenly came forward, took off his trench coat, and put it on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? You gave me your coat. Aren't you feeling cold just wearing short sleeves?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was surprised. When I found Quinn only wore a black short-sleeved shirt, I immediately wanted to return the trench coat to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I work out every day, and I'm strong. Just wear it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said nothing more to me. He not only put his coat on for me but also motioned for me to fasten the buttons.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="225.html">« Prev</a><a href="227.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
