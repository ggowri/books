How come the moment Laura and her crew walked in, he turned all quiet?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must've been awake for a while now, just playing me for a fool.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, I turned to him, a dubious look in my eyes. Almost instinctively, I wanted to pinch him, just to see if he was putting on an act.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Laura came rushing over like a madwoman, gripping my hand tightly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, we all saw what you just did to Elliott! Are you really trying to take advantage of him in broad daylight? I never thought you could be so venomous. Not only are you promiscuous, but you're also wicked. What has Elliott ever done to you? You lured him to a place like Norch City, and he ended up getting seriously injured because of you! You're despicable!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wail, Laura suddenly raised her hand and slapped me hard across the face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at me. Her gaze was fierce, venomous. She clearly looked like she despised me to the core.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her slap left me dazed and disoriented. Instinctively, I covered my face, biting my lip as I stared at her. But, I didn't hit back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott got hurt this time because of me. I get her pain as a mother. So, I took that slap. But just that one, and no more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I abruptly rose to my feet, my gaze sternly fixed on her. I advanced towards her step by step, causing her to retreat in fear. She was so scared that she could barely articulate her words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what... what do you want? Weren't you pregnant? What happened to your belly? Did you give birth, or did you miscarry?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, Elliott got hurt saving me, I admit that. But you're wrong if you think I tricked him into going to Norch City. I've never been in touch with him, you can ask Barry if you don't believe me. I didn't mean to do anything to him just now, he just suddenly lunged at me out of nowhere, it was weird. Instead of wasting your time accusing me, you should be getting a doctor to check on him. We need to know if he's really awake or if there's something else going on. That's what really matters!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I towered over Laura, looking straight into her eyes as I spoke, each word deliberate and clear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After these two years of trials and tribulations, I've come to feel a constant pressure, both in my words and actions. The moment I uttered these words, I could distinctly see a flicker of fear in Laura's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took another step back. Yet, despite this, she still didn't believe my words. She scoffed:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott was perfectly fine, lying there. How on earth could he just wake up and lunge at you? You're the one losing it. From where I stand, it seems like you couldn't handle the loneliness and decided to take advantage of Elliott when we weren't around! Madeline, I know your true colors all too well. You begged and pleaded to come to my house in the first place. Now you're the cast-off of the Bryant family, and you have the audacity to seduce Elliott in such a shameless manner? Not cool, Madeline."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all this time apart, I didn't expect Laura's tongue to be as venomous as ever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word she uttered was like a needle to my ears, piercing my nerves. It instantly stirred up all the discomfort I had suppressed during my time with the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, everything had passed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she insisted on provoking me. So, I stepped forward, cornering her against the wall. I grabbed her collar, my gaze piercing into her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="768.html">« Prev</a><a href="770.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
