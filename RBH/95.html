Even if he agreed to have dinner with me at home, we would still end up arguing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was surprised when Elliott invited me to have dinner with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! Are we going now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I certainly agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. You wait for me downstairs. I will come down immediately," Elliott said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About ten minutes later, I saw Elliott coming out of the Bryant Group. He gestured for me to get in his car and join him on the way to the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I handed my car keys to Toby and asked him to drive me back. Afterward, Elliott drove me out for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn arrived, so the sky got darker earlier and earlier. The whole city was soon covered by the night. The scattered neon lights made Hoswich shine particularly, like an emerging international city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you planning to take me for dinner tonight?" I asked as we were on the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moonlight Restaurant! Its ambiance was nice," Elliott whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moonlight Restaurant was the most popular upscale restaurant in Hoswich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is said that this restaurant is located on the top floor of the iconic building in Hoswich, the Hoswich Tower. This restaurant is very unique, so it is difficult to make a reservation. However, for Elliott, this is a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, you are very familiar with the restaurants in Hoswich," I said deliberately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott understood what I meant and gently tapped my forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott smiled and said, "Don't be jealous. Be generous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I cursed in my heart but put on a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How many women did you take there for dinner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Ordinary people were not worthy of dining at Moonlight Restaurant with me. Only you were qualified."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never thought Elliott would please me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was surprised by his sudden compliment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, women all like compliments, including me. Therefore, I immediately became happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wanted to eat the best and most expensive food at Moonlight Restaurant tonight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ordered all the food on the menu, as long as you could eat it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Elliott could love a woman unconditionally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder those women have been constantly pursuing Elliott all these years. After all, women always like gentle and wealthy men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want Giselle and Elliott to be together even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened my phone and unexpectedly saw Giselle posting on Instagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle posted a photo of herself holding a large bouquet of flowers with Rowan. In addition to that, Giselle wrote a caption: "Destined lovers will not break up after a fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle publicly revealed her love on the internet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the photos and text, I screamed with joy and purposely made Elliott uncomfortable.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="94.html">« Prev</a><a href="96.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
