He skillfully raised and clinked glasses, showcasing his business elite demeanor to the fullest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed quickly, </span><span>and </span><span>gradually, the whole dinner finally approached its end, and the guests also left in pairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rubbed my sore neck and slipped into the lounge to take off this gorgeous yet cumbersome dress, and changed into casual clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and Quinn invited me to have a drink after the show, and I agreed with them. After all, after dealing with such a night, I was very tired and really needed to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I changed my clothes and returned to the venue. Most of the guests had already left, and Elliott was standing with his hands in his pockets, bidding farewell to a client.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively walked up to him, intending to explain something to him, but to my surprise, at that moment, I saw a waiter not far from him suddenly giving me a strange look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Elliott's figure intently, then suddenly threw the tablecloth he was holding in his hand, and instantly had a shiny knife in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lights in the venue were bright, and the knife gleamed with a cold light, stabbing straight towards Elliott's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden scene made my blood freeze instantly, and I hurriedly shouted, "Elliott, be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I finished speaking, at that very moment, a figure shot past me like an arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, I heard a girl's scream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything happened so fast, within just a few seconds, so fast that there was no time to think.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I came to my senses, several bodyguards had already swarmed and pinned the male waiter to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Elliott's hands, he held a fallen girl, wearing a pristine white dress. Blood horrifyingly spread from her waist, and soon, on that pristine white hem, bloomed one after another dazzling and eerie flowers...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>White dress, white shoes, ponytail, my brain couldn't help but go "boom" instantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Giselle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that the figure that just ran past me was actually her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that she would actually rush over and block the knife for Elliott!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, even though I had set obstacles for their encounter, even though Elliott had been gradually changing his attitude towards me, the destined outcome of their meeting was still something I couldn't change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They eventually met, and at this moment, Giselle, weakly lying in Elliott's arms, not only that,</span><span> but</span><span> she also became Elliott's lifesaver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My feet went weak beneath me, cold sweat broke out in the palms of my hands, my head was buzzing, and I felt completely numb all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched helplessly as my husband picked up the injured Giselle, and then he roared excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you standing there for! Hurry up, drive</span><span>,</span><span> and take the person to the hospital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice was so tense, he furrowed his brow and stared unblinkingly at Giselle, who he held tightly in his arms, with one hand firmly covering the wound on her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood oozed from the gaps in his large palm, appearing horrifyingly shocking. He lowered his head, seemingly comforting Giselle continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in his arms, Giselle, even though her face was filled with a painful expression, still managed to force a faint smile, her lips moved as if she was saying to him:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was fine, you didn't need to worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their encounter, in the end, finally began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This plot is far more profound and unforgettable than playing the piano.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why wasn't I the one who just rushed over?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why didn't I think of rushing over to block Elliott from getting stabbed like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My whole heart was plunged into chaos, and all my strength seemed to be instantly drained. I felt like I had become a wandering soul, just watching my husband, holding the girl he was about to fall in love with, go away until they completely disappeared from my sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warm palm, at this moment, gently rested on my shoulder...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="56.html">« Prev</a><a href="58.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
