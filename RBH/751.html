I constantly felt as if there was something standing between him and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't quite put my finger on what it is.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was about to probe further, but thankfully, Fiona and Paige walked in just then, arms full of flowers and bags laden with fruit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they saw me awake, they instantly dropped whatever they were holding, rushing over to me and enveloping me in a tight embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've truly lost your mind, running off to such a dangerous place while you're pregnant! Do you have any idea how close you and the baby came to dying? If it wasn't for Quinn pulling strings with his family connections to bring in the best military doctors, you and the baby would have been in real danger!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon laying eyes on me, Fiona couldn't help but lash out in anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona's right, this time it was really dangerous! Why on earth would you go to such a perilous place like the border! You knew you were pregnant, yet you were so reckless! We were so scared when we got the news, we couldn't sleep for days. Thank God you and the baby were lucky."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paige spoke, she prayed simultaneously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I know they're all genuinely concerned about me, and I'm deeply touched.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, out of the blue, my thoughts drifted to Jane. In those circumstances, she had put herself in harm's way, time and again, shielding me with her own body. If she were to be seriously injured because of me, I could never forgive myself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm lucky, and I owe a lot to Jane. How is she? Where is she now? I want to see her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I yearn to rise at once and check on Jane, eager to know how she's faring.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've just given birth, with a C-section scar still fresh on your belly. You need to rest now. Jane's tough, her injuries are all superficial. She's recuperating in a regular ward, past the critical stage. Marcus is taking care of her, so you can rest easy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my eagerness to get out of bed, Quinn hastily grabbed me, saying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that Jane was okay, I instantly felt a bit of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard Elliott's been sent to Norch City on business, and it seems like he's run into some trouble. He's in the ICU now, fighting for his life. Does Elliott have any connection to you guys?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Fiona posed a question that took me by surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had an accident in Norch City too? Is this a coincidence?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's going on here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not sure, but as fate would have it, I bumped into him on the flight to Norch City. He was sitting right next to me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, speaking in a nonchalant tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Word has it that he was in a car accident, his vehicle tumbled down a hillside. By some stroke of luck, his assistant located him using GPS. He's still in critical condition."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn spoke, and with his words, my shock deepened.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="750.html">« Prev</a><a href="752.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
