However, I understood it more than anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand, Quinn. You mean that you witnessed the tragic end of my previous life and saw the entire process of my death, so you were reborn into my life with the purpose of saving me?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw that I understood, so he immediately nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can think of it that way. Anyway, in the previous life, you didn't have a good time and had a tragic ending. In the end, Giselle made you sink into the sea, and I witnessed everything. I was extremely shocked at that time. I didn't expect Giselle to be so malicious behind her innocent appearance. I also didn't expect that you were not as annoying as I thought. On the contrary, you were just a woman who couldn't have the love she wanted. I chose to dive and save you at that time, but the storm was too strong that day. I didn't manage to save you and ended up sinking myself... Later, when I woke up, I suddenly found myself back a few years ago, when you and Elliott hadn't divorced yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn calmly recounted the incident. Seeing no excessive shock on my face, he thought I couldn't understand, so he asked me again, "If I say this, would you find it difficult to comprehend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, still very puzzled. "No. So, this doesn't have a direct relationship with you being nice to me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he laughed again, with a hint of bitterness in his laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course it matters, and it matters a great deal. If I hadn't seen with my own eyes everything that Giselle did to you, I would still be in the dark, thinking she was a pure and flawless woman, and you were despicable. But after seeing it with my own eyes, I realized how foolish I was. As a good brother of Elliott Ho, I have insulted you, mocked you, and hurt you more than once. I am partly to blame for your miserable end in your previous life. I jumped into the sea without hesitation to save you, and at that moment, I thought that if I could save you, I would treat you well and make up for the mistakes I had made before. Although I couldn't save you, when I discovered that I was reborn, I felt that it must be a chance given to me by God to get close to you again, to know you, and to protect you... Elliott, whether you believe it or not, from the moment I was reborn, I felt that my life was meant to be lived for you, to come for you. Do you understand now why I am being good to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn finally confessed everything, and his words left me utterly shocked...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="708.html">« Prev</a><a href="710.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
