Eventually, the distant echoes brought back some peace to the ward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott wasted no time in making tracks, probably worried Giselle and Nicole might stir up more trouble. They left together in a flash.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Giselle and Nicole were out of sight, Quinn shot a look to the people he brought along.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone got the memo and high-tailed it out of the ward, slamming the door shut behind them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a scene! I bet it disturbed my dad's peaceful snooze big time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been knocked out for ages. Never thought he'd have to deal with all this mess while he was sick. Made me feel super guilty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I approached his bed, grabbing his hand and leaning in close.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, sorry for all the drama. I'm moving you to another hospital now. Hang in there a little longer, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was used to seeing him sleep so peacefully, and I didn't dare hope he'd wake up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when I glanced at him after saying those words, I saw tears welling up in the corners of his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, my whole body froze, like I was stuck in time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad, shedding tears? I couldn't believe it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this a sign he was about to wake up, feeling stuff and all?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched in disbelief, but then I felt his finger move.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was subtle, but I felt it because I was holding his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom! Come quick, Dad's... he's crying!" I yelled, and my mother immediately rushed to the bedside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gripping the edge tight, she burst into tears when she saw Dad's tears, overwhelmed with joy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn rushed over too. "He's crying! I'll call the doctor!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad's fingers moved, and it feels like he's waking up," I said, gripping Mom's hand, tears welling up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Dad's eyelids flickered, and his fingers twitched some more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was definitely on the brink of waking up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't even put my feelings into words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn dashed off to get Dad's doctor, who asked us to step aside so he could check Dad out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the doctor turned to me, grinning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your dad's starting to respond. He's almost awake! We'll run some tests right away!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="396.html">« Prev</a><a href="398.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
