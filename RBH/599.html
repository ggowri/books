I advise you to mind your own business!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel glared at Paige with an intimidating demeanor, appearing quite formidable to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Birds of a feather flock together. This Jezebel seems to be cut from the same cloth as Giselle in terms of her character and behavior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were just chatting, and you clearly initiated this confrontation. What does it have to do with you when we were talking about someone in the entertainment industry having promiscuous relationships with many people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige directly confronted Jezebel, sparking a heated argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a familiar voice came from beside us. "What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I turned to look and saw Quinn and Philip walking over from a short distance away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn must have heard the commotion and realized something was amiss, so he immediately rushed towards us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pulling me and Paige behind him, Quinn then coldly said to Jezebel, "Ms. Carlton, these two are my friends. What's going on with you all, arguing at the hospital entrance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So Mr. Woods is friends with them..." Jezebel, this flirtatious woman, perked up at the sight of Quinn and immediately started to act coy. "I didn't want to argue with them. They were talking behind my back, saying bad things about me, and I overheard it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Jezebel was quite adept at socializing, not only knowing Philip but also recognizing Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Quinn turned to me and, in front of Jezebel, affectionately pinched my cheek, gently asking, "Did you speak ill of her just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understood Quinn's implication instantly and replied with a smile, "No, we were just talking about how some women in the entertainment industry are like buses, anyone can have a ride. If Ms. Carlton thinks we were talking about her, then she must see herself that way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's how it is." Quinn deliberately drew out his words, then looked at Jezebel. "Ms. Carlton, it seems you also believe you're the 'bus' they were referring to? Otherwise, how can you be so sure they were talking about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially pleased to see Quinn, Jezebel clearly tried to please him in her speech before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she quickly caught on to Quinn and my synchronized questioning and answers, realizing that Quinn was actually siding with us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of rage, Jezebel instinctively looked behind Quinn as if desperately searching for something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subconsciously, I glanced behind Quinn as well, only to realize that there was no one behind him at all...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "I distinctly remembered seeing Philip and Quinn together just now, so why is Philip walking so slowly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did I just imagine seeing Philip with Quinn?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="598.html">« Prev</a><a href="600.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
