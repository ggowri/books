That's the fetal movement, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and couldn't help but smile. "Well, I am in the late stage of pregnancy now, and he loves to move. He moves every now and then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like he must be a lovely boy for sure. When he comes out, I will take him to play basketball and football, and arrange all the sports that boys like for him. I will nurture him well from a young age." The gleam of joy was evident in Quinn's eyes, as if the baby in his belly was his own son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Quinn's sincere appearance, it is impossible for me to not be moved even a little bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke to me from the bottom of his heart, and I couldn't help but feel a slight tremor in my emotions... However, the shadow left by my previous marriage was too overwhelming, to the point where I simply couldn't accept and start a new relationship at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Marcus's arrangement, the next day at noon, I and Dalton agreed to meet at a restaurant in Hoswich city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I saw Dalton again, the low-key director looked much more haggard than the last time I saw him at the awards ceremony. He was dressed more casually, wearing a black sportswear with a duckbill cap. He had his hair tied in a braid at the back of his head, and his face was covered in a full beard. At first glance, he appeared very weathered, with even his skin tanned to a sallow color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Marcus had made preparations in advance, we were all well aware of the purpose of this meeting. Therefore, as soon as we sat down, we got straight to the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Director Lewis, at what stage is the filming of this movie now? How many backers are currently supporting it behind the scenes?" I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the middle to later stages, everything was progressing smoothly. However, my subject matter is very sensitive, involving allegations of organ trafficking and some international secret transactions. It may affect the interests of certain individuals, and there are people exerting pressure in secret, leading to the successive cancellations of cooperation from the initial investors. To be honest, I have already put all my assets at stake to make this film, but currently, there is still a funding gap of around 200 million." Dalton said truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could feel that he, like Marcus, was the kind of person who is practical and introverted. Once he sets his mind on something, he will definitely overcome all obstacles to carry it through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The 200 million issue is not a big problem, Director Lewis. I can help you," I said as soon as I heard that the funding gap was within my means. Without asking further questions, I immediately agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton looked up in astonishment. Clearly, he hadn't expected me to agree so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, I know that with the strength of your company, 200 million in funding is indeed not a big problem. However, you didn't even ask me about the specific details of this movie, and you just agreed?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I trust Marcus. If he trusts someone, I definitely trust them too." I used Marcus as a direct excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in fact, I didn't really need to know in detail because in the previous life, I not only watched the movie called "Rattlesnake" in the cinema, but also knew clearly how much box office it would achieve in the near future, how many awards it would win, and Dalton, this person, would even rise to the position of a first-line director in the country after this movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, at that time, he didn't know how brilliant his future would be. So, when I confirmed my willingness to invest, his eyes shimmered with tears of immense excitement.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="711.html">« Prev</a><a href="713.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
