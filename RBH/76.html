Let's talk about something happy. Madeline, how do you feel about working at Glory Group recently? I heard from your dad that you are quite serious about your job, and you have the courage and enthusiasm. That's great, keep it up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother, afraid that my father would be upset, quickly changed the subject and asked me with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly adjusted my emotions and was about to talk to my parents when suddenly the doorbell of my house rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "Who would appear at the door so late?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents and I glanced at each other, and then I ran over and took a look through the peephole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, I saw Elliott holding a bag, standing outside my house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "Elliott?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he suddenly pay a visit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to disdain coming to my house before, even the gifts for my parents were only sent by Toby at his request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood at the door, and when my mom saw that I didn't open it, she walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, who was at the door?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" my mom exclaimed in surprise. Before I could react, she immediately swung open the door. "Oh my, it's you, Elliott. Come in, come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom saw Elliott and was as happy as a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately invited Elliott in with great excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Elliott faintly. Since the day I shouted those words at him in the hospital, I haven't had any contact with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, seeing him appear at my house at this moment, I felt a bit at a loss and also a bit embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had a faint smile on his face as he handed the gift in his hand to my mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, today is Thanksgiving, and I came here specifically to accompany you. These are some supplements for you and Austin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was surprised by Elliott's performance today. Not only did he bring supplements, but he also had Toby bring in several boxes of cigarettes and red wine. He really went all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, come in quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad also came over. Although he had just scolded Elliott a while ago, he was still very happy to see Elliott appear at this moment, and a smile filled his face again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't stand at the door, it was quite cold outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had just come in, perhaps seeing me still standing at the doorway, he naturally grabbed my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he had been so affectionate with me in front of my parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was shocked like being electrocuted. I just wanted to pull my hand back, but he grabbed my hand and pulled me back to the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother had already brought him the utensils at that time. After he sat down next to me, he immediately poured himself a drink, respectfully raised a glass to my parents, and then said some polite words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's actions made my dad's dissatisfaction with him disappear in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He happily drank with Elliott and the two of them began discussing the recent domestic and international economic situation, as well as the progress of the project collaboration between the Bryant Group and Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conversation between men, my mom and I couldn't join in. The two of us just sat there silently listening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but sneak a few glances at Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, he was no longer dressed in a suit and tie but instead opted for a casual outfit. He wore a simple light grey sweater with a white T-shirt underneath, paired with khaki pants. Compared to the usual seriousness he exuded, he appeared much more approachable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I remember correctly, this outfit he is wearing is the one I brought back for him from abroad when we had just gotten married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, all my attention was on him. I even thought about bringing clothes and skincare products for him when I went abroad. However, the things I bought, he didn't even bother to look at them, and he found them too ordinary. He never wore any of the clothes I bought for him, and he never used any of the skincare products, even when they expired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "Today he actually wore the clothes I bought, how did he suddenly change?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="75.html">« Prev</a><a href="77.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
