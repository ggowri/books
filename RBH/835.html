It's a peculiar feeling, indeed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, Elliott made a point to drop me off at the base of my office building.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hopped out of his car and barely made it into the office when I ran smack into Adam coming the other way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was taken aback when he saw me stepping out of Elliott's car. After exchanging greetings, we rode the elevator together to my office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, is this... are you back together with Mr. Bryant?" Adam's voice wavered, uncertain if he should even be asking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No strings attached. I'm just accommodating his condition. Why do you ask?" I replied nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam nodded, then added, "I heard that Mr. Bryant is partnering with a medicinal herb company in Norch City. They're planning to develop a large-scale herb farm. Madeline, has Mr. Bryant mentioned this to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be a collaboration with Lisa?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, is this the reason why Elliott headed to Norch City?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, "I haven't heard him mention it. What's their aim in developing a medicinal plant base? Are they planning to produce medicine too?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Word is, that herbal company in Norch City is something else. They've got a ton of secret family recipes they're planning to produce in collaboration with the Bryant Group. But doesn't that mean Bryant Group is heading down a different path than us?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam said, puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam's words suddenly cast a shadow of doubt over Elliott's motives.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's been really nice to me lately, no doubt about that. But he's never let me in on his business dealings, not once. What exactly is going on between him and Lisa?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he really be playing the role of my spouse while secretly competing against me behind my scenes?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last time, our anti-flu capsules sold like hotcakes, and their anti-flu oral liquid wasn't too shabby either. Is the Bryant Group raking in the dough and thinking about breaking into the pharmaceutical market?" I put down my work, a frown creasing my forehead as I shot back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I reckon it's quite possible. The Bryant Group seems to have taken a hit recently due to some poor decisions by Mr. Bryant, resulting in significant losses. They've been making some big moves lately. Besides this, I heard they've also invested in a few TV shows and movies."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Tell me the names of the TV shows and movies they've invested in," I quickly retorted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam shot the names over to my phone in an instant. The moment I saw the titles of the TV shows and movies, I was taken aback.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="834.html">« Prev</a><a href="836.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
