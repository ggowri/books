To entertain me, his parents even had the servants prepare a whole table full of dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Jessica kept serving me food as if afraid I wouldn't have enough to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back to how I was treated coldly when I accompanied Elliott to the Bryant family, I felt conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, despite Quinn's and my objections, Jessica and Carole insisted on accompanying me to the hospital for a check-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We tried to refuse, but they persisted, leaving me no choice but to grit my teeth and let them accompany me to Fiona's hospital for the examination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona had finally returned from Tepit and was already back to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, I briefly explained my current situation to them in our group chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paige and Fiona heard about Jessica and Carole's insistence on taking me for a check-up, they were both shocked, not knowing what to say in response to this miraculous turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But given the current situation, we could only go along with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was mentally prepared in advance, so when she saw Jessica and Carole accompanying me, she didn't say much but immediately prepared the relevant documents for me to undergo the examination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been so long since I had an ultrasound.
