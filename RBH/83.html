He immediately walked over quickly and picked up his phone from the table, then swiftly opened the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, I noticed that his mood seemed to improve. He quickly tapped on the screen and replied to something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "So, even a message from Giselle could make him so nervous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps only Giselle could make him care so much,"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I looked at the pure white moonlight, I felt even more sorrowful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood up from the chair and pretended to yawn, saying tiredly, "I am a bit tired, I want to go back and sleep. Or, would you like to sit for a while longer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, let's go downstairs together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put away his phone and placed it in his pocket, then he said to me in a casual tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I yawned again, watching as he put his phone into his pocket. At that moment, I didn't know why I said inexplicably, "I heard that Giselle already had a boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know why I said this sentence, maybe I just wanted to see how Elliott would react, after all, he was such a possessive person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew. But they weren't a good match, that man wasn't suitable for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, he immediately responded to me. From his words, I could tell that he had already gained enough understanding of Giselle's life, and I could even faintly sense the confidence in his speech.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His performance left me speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know that they were not suitable? Are you suitable, then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't mean to say it like this, but I couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to only realize the irony in my words at that moment. He suddenly laughed and flicked my forehead with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you serious? Are you jealous of a little girl?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "Little girl?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, she was the person you loved the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do you know that in the near future, you will fall uncontrollably in love with him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled at him and continued, "I wasn't jealous now. Even if you started dating her tomorrow, I wouldn't care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried my best to show that I didn't care. But when Elliott heard my words, the smile on his face immediately disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was not a playboy, I was not liked by every woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "I hope you can remember the words you said tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but mutter in my heart, but I said, "Hmm, I hope not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, stop arguing with me. Let's go, we're going downstairs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out and grabbed my shoulder, wanting to take me downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I quickly bent over, bypassing his hand and agilely slipping behind him. He glared at me angrily, and I smiled, explaining, "This staircase is too narrow, we really can't walk side by side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew I was making excuses, so he coolly put his hands in his pockets and went downstairs first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I followed him downstairs, but he unexpectedly went into the master bedroom again. Moreover, as soon as he entered the room, he directly took off his shirt and the white T-shirt inside.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="82.html">« Prev</a><a href="84.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
