There weren't many customers, and the bar space wasn't very large, about seventy to eighty square meters. However, it was tastefully decorated and warm, forming a stark contrast to the icy world outside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I and Quinn chose a seat by the window and sat down. We noticed a few young men and women sitting around a table not far from us, dressed stylishly and exuding youthful energy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn ordered a few bottles of beer and some fries to accompany the drinks. Shortly after, the waitress brought us the glasses.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at the time, it was already midnight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, I would have been tired by this time. But probably because I had resolved a major worry today, I still felt energized.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the neighboring table, a girl's voice caught my attention. "Did you hear? Giselle and Rowan have broken up. I heard Giselle is about to marry into a wealthy family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle, Rowan...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two names were extremely familiar, and I suddenly felt alert. I quickly looked up and saw several young men and women at the nearby table, dressed stylishly and exuding youthful energy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you seen Giselle's posts? Not long ago, she flaunted a high-end dress, then later showcased a pearl necklace and designer perfume, and recently she posted a property deed. Women's work capabilities can't compare to finding a good partner. It seems like she hasn't hung out with us for a long time, right?" Another girl said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's already a socialite now. Since she's even left a big hottie like Rowan, what are we compared to her? Just a few days ago, I saw her at the hospital's gynecology department. She said she was getting a checkup. Do you think she might be pregnant?" Yet another girl said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pregnancy is normal for her. Aren't wealthy wives supposed to have multiple children? But let's not gossip. After all, Giselle used to be a good friend of ours. It's not right to talk behind her back like this," A girl whispered softly, seeming to defend Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I listened intently to their conversation while discreetly taking note of the appearance of these girls and snapping a photo. I planned to ask Adam later who they were; Adam would surely know.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right. I just texted Giselle. She said she's on her way. Now that she's found a good place, we should wish her well. When she arrives, let's not talk nonsense. It took me a lot of effort to get her to come out." Another guy spoke up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, the bar's door suddenly swung open. Then, I heard a clear and familiar voice. "Sorry, everyone, I'm a bit late due to some business. Have you all been drinking well?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Giselle's voice, and I recognized it immediately. Subconsciously, I put down the beer in my hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn obviously heard their conversation and Giselle's voice, but he didn't say anything. He just looked at me quietly, then said lightly, "Well, isn't this a coincidence? Your nemesis is here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled faintly, glanced in the direction of the voice, and saw Giselle wearing a white lambskin jacket, a brown ultra-short skirt, and a pair of small black boots. Her long hair was loose, slightly curled, and her face was heavily made up. Then, she quickly walked towards the table where the others were sitting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the distance and our corner seating, she hadn't noticed our presence yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle sat down directly when she reached the empty seat. As soon as she sat down, she took off her jacket, revealing a low-cut base shirt underneath. In the dim light of the bar, Giselle looked exceptionally sexy...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="324.html">« Prev</a><a href="326.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
