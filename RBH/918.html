Did I see it wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could I be hallucinating about someone in a foreign country?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouldn't know I'm in Korea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, mocking myself inwardly, then sat down in a corner with Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was already deep in conversation with the guy who had approached her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never misses a chance for a romantic encounter, no matter where she is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at her, she's practically begging to be swept off her feet tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona shook her head, exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's her style. Ever since she broke up with Philip, she's stopped believing in love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh, holding my drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, let's have a drink."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona picked up her glass without hesitation, clinking it with mine and smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two beautiful ladies drinking alone? Let me join you. If I'm not mistaken, you must be from my hometown."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A trendy guy with silver hair suddenly sat next to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke fluent English, making us feel a bit more at home in a place filled with Korean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. Judging by your style, are you studying here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up and saw a tall, handsome man with familiar features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got it right. What brings you two here? Are you also exchange students like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man sat down and asked us with a friendly smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona and I graduated years ago. Being mistaken for students was a roundabout way of saying we look young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Fiona couldn't help but laugh:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're quite the charmer. We're here for a vacation. Where are you from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You both look so young like we're the same age. I'm from Hoswich city. My name is Orson Bryant. Nice to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He extended his hand to us with a friendly introduction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoswich city? Last name Bryant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a shiver run down my spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he be related to Elliott? The moment I saw him, I felt a familiar resemblance. Now with his introduction, I realized he looks a bit like Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his fair skin and trendy style made him look different from Elliott, so I thought I was mistaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Fiona, who was equally surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona shook his hand and casually asked:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? What a coincidence! We're also from Hoswich City. There aren't many Bryants there. Are you related to Mr. Bryant from Bryant Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orson smiled, a charming, youthful grin:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott is my cousin. Our dads are cousins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We guessed right. This handsome guy was indeed related to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories flooded my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remembered Elliott and his dad were only children, but Elliott's grandfather had several brothers, some in politics, some in business, all notable in Hoswich city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, this handsome guy must be the son of one of Elliott's uncles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, despite my time with the Bryant family, I didn't interact much with their relatives, so I couldn't recall who they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're from the Bryant family. No wonder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona said meaningfully, then smiled at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I caught her drift. She thought it was quite a coincidence to meet Elliott's relative in Korea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have thought?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are your names? How long are you staying in Korea? I have free time and can show you around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Elliott's aloofness, Orson was lively and eager to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, if you're free, why not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona winked, clearly interested in Orson. In no time, they were sharing drinks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Korean beer was tasty but filled you up.Seeing them engrossed in conversation, I excused myself to the restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bar's dim lighting made it hard to navigate through the crowd. Just as I neared the restroom, a drunk man blocked my way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked sleazy, with a thick metal necklace and reeking of alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed my waist and started speaking in Korean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Korean was limited, but I could tell he was calling me "sister" and saying something vulgar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me! Or I'll call the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect this in a foreign country, and the language barrier made it worse. I struggled to speak Korean, unsure if my pronunciation was correct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clearly didn't understand me. He grinned lewdly and moved closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then his hand slid towards my chest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a chill down my spine. As his hand approached, I instinctively bit his chubby arm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such moments, I had to save myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I bit hard, catching him off guard. He screamed in pain, my teeth leaving a red mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned vicious, cursing in Korean, and swung his hand towards my face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a tall figure appeared beside me, grabbing the man's arm!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="917.html">« Prev</a><a href="919.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
