I turned to see Lisa Fox standing before us, clad in a sheer black mesh top and a form-fitting black skirt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mesh top was sheer, revealing a bold red bra underneath. The striking contrast of red and black, coupled with her provocative attire, delivered a powerful visual punch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her makeup was quite bold today, with her lashes dark and long, lips a fiery red. She wore a black veil atop her head, obscuring half her face, lending her an air of mystery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lisa, you're here too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott cast her a glance, responding with a nonchalant tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard Mr. Bryant played the knight in shining armor, which apparently ruffled Diego's feathers. So, I came to see what the fuss was all about. But seeing Ms. Mayers here, it all makes sense now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa flashed a seductive smile. Her face, which once bore a resemblance to mine, was now heavily made up, significantly reducing our likeness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden realization hit me - her resemblance to me could be altered through the art of makeup.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was him who disrespected Madeline first, and we've just resolved the conflict. What's the matter? Is Mr. Rodr&iacute;guez still in a bad mood?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said, his voice icy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no. Diego just wanted me to lighten the mood a bit. Mr. Bryant, would you do us the honor of joining us for a few drinks in the room?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa asked with a laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, Elliott turned to me, asking:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to go?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, stating bluntly, "I don't want to go, I don't want to interact with people like that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, then I won't go either. If you're feeling tired, I can take you home right now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, Elliott wasn't going either. He took my hand, ready to lead me away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smile on Lisa's face vanished in an instant. She grabbed hold of Elliott's sleeve, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, think it through. Diego has a nasty temper. The fact that he's willing to share a drink with you is already him giving you a chance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott chuckled dismissively, remarking:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In Hoswich City, I don't need anyone to give me a chance, except for my wife."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Elliott disregarded Lisa and gently planted a kiss on my forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His actions were clearly telling Lisa, he had no interest in any woman but her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers sure has some luck, not only making a bunch of men fall head over heels for her, but also managing to secure their protection. I could really learn a thing or two from her skills and abilities."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa shot me a glance filled with envy, but in a blink, she retracted it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew the score between Elliott and me, so her words were dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fox, when it comes to tactics and skills, you're truly the best."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I headed straight out into the open.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was held back by Lisa, who seemed to whisper a few more words to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I bid farewell to Dalton, leaving the private vineyard behind. Just as I reached the main gate, my mom suddenly rang me up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at the time subconsciously, it was a little past two in the afternoon. Under normal circumstances, my mom rarely calls me during the day unless it's something urgent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily picked up the call:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what's up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, get back here quick! Laura Bryant has shown up at our place. She's knocking on the door right now!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="854.html">« Prev</a><a href="856.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
