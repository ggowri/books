Come with me, I'll introduce you to some important guests."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott paid no attention to my surprise and immediately pulled me toward the center. Afterward, he introduced several heavyweight guests to me one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These VIP guests had all attended our wedding before, so naturally, they were all familiar with Glory Group, and thus, everyone exchanged polite greetings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was my first time accompanying Elliott to entertain guests, and at first, I was a little uncomfortable with this role. However, since I had seen the world from a young age, I quickly adapted and soon I was moving around the room with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gave me face, and I also gave him face. It was our first time thanking the guests as a couple, but it seemed like there was a special understanding between us. We coordinated seamlessly and complemented each other perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after a long time of fake smiling, it did become a bit tiring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finally accompanying him to socialize, I was just about to sneak backstage to have some dessert when Elliott's secretary, Barry Smith, approached him and said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, there was a major issue with the event schedule, and we need you to come up with a solution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did the process go wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't that the thing about the pianist?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately understood, so I quickly followed Elliott and went backstage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the backstage office, it was a mess at the moment. As soon as Elliott arrived, Amy Swift, the director of the Planning Department, rushed over anxiously and reported:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, we just received some very bad news. Pianist Carli was just involved in a car accident on her way here. She is currently in the hospital. However, her piano performance is scheduled to start in ten minutes. What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as expected, it was the same as the previous life...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carli Patterson, a renowned mixed-race pianist, was the highlight of tonight's performance. Many VIP guests in the audience were fans of Carli. Prior to the event, the Bryant Group had also emphasized the promotion of Carli's piano performance. However, her sudden absence undoubtedly diminished the entire show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was an extremely perfectionistic person, and any flaw in detail was unforgivable to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Amy's words, Elliott furrowed his eyebrows and scolded her in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you supposed to ensure that nothing goes wrong? How could such an accident happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was a sudden situation when a large truck suddenly rear-ended their car, and we certainly didn't expect it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just at that moment, a clear and pleasant female voice suddenly rang out in the crowd. Immediately after, Giselle, who had been silent in the crowd, suddenly stood up and shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sound startled me, and my blood was about to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has that long-awaited historic moment arrived?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was about to meet the woman he had been longing for and obsessing over in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of look would he have when he saw her for the first time?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="52.html">« Prev</a><a href="54.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
