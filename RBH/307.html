As soon as I had just walked to the entrance of the conference room, I heard the murmurs coming from everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could Mr. Austin Mayers suddenly have such an accident? It's so sudden!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, the company has several big projects going online recently. What should we do if such a thing happens during this critical period?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that Mr. Austin Mayers is unconscious, we should quickly select a representative. Who do you think is most suitable?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it's Ms. Jade Mayers. In recent years, she has been studying group affairs with Mr. Austin Mayers comprehensively, and she is also Mr. Austin Mayers' niece, so I think she is the most suitable."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't agree. Mr. Austin Mayers' daughter, Ms. Madeline Mayers, is the most suitable candidate. She didn't manage the company affairs before, but recently she made that movie and TV project work quite well. Ms. Madeline Mayers does things in the style of Mr. Austin Mayers as well. Besides, she is the rightful heir."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Madeline Mayers? What would she know? She probably doesn't know anything about the company. Managing a company, after all, isn't as easy as making a movie, not investing some money."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stopped and listened quietly for a moment. It was obvious that the company's leaders and a few shareholders had split into two factions, one in favor of me and the other in favor of Jade.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked into the conference room. Everyone saw me come in and immediately stopped talking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw Jade at a glance. She was wearing an orange professional suit and tied a ponytail. Her hair was combed to the back of her head, appearing to have a big head. Jade's features were clear, and her flaming red lips deliberately emphasized the aura of an able woman.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In these few years, she followed Austin and had indeed accumulated a lot of experience.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her confident appearance in the Glory Group, I became more and more secretly regretful. I regretted that I wasted all my good years chasing Elliott and didn't improve myself in time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So much so that now I did seem even less qualified in front of Jade. But no matter what, I told myself that I must firmly control the Glory Group, and there was no way I would let Jade take it away from me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meeting soon officially started, so everyone quickly discussed the topic they had just discussed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized that Jade had apparently contacted several shareholders on the site in advance. They were all in favor of Jade taking control of the company.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, several experienced leaders, led by Katrina, were of the opinion that I was the rightful candidate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a while, everyone had their own views, and the scene became stalemated. The argument between the two parties became more and more intense. So, I did not hesitate, and I directly stood up and said, "We discuss like this and also perish the result. I propose this solution. I have a movie and television project, and Ms. Jade Mayers also has a financial project in her hands. Both projects are about to be put into the market. Let's determine the winners and losers based on the percentage of the project's profit. For a period of one month, if the profit ratio of my project is greater than that of Ms. Jade Mayers, then I will be elected as the agent, and vice versa, Ms. Jade Mayers will be elected as the agent. The decision-making within the month will be signed by both Ms. Jade Mayers and me. In this way, is there no objection?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I braced my hands on the conference table and looked around the room with a stern gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked. No one probably expected me to have the audacity to make a bet on my project when I was only working on my first one. And Jade obviously didn't expect this either.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled with contempt, clasped her hands, looked at me with a raised eyebrow, and said, "Madeline, are you sure? Are you so confident in that project of yours?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I'd rather not do anything I don't have confidence in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up and leveled my eyes at Jade, undaunted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, then it's settled. You have confidence in your program, and I have the same confidence in mine!" Jade said in a hushed voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at her winning look and recalled the way she flaunted herself in front of me after getting control of the Glory Group in my last life. I couldn't help but somewhat loathe and detest her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, I won't let her have such an opportunity again!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="306.html">« Prev</a><a href="308.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
