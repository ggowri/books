What shocked me even more was that his pants dropped to the floor the next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his underwear was blatantly exposed right in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could clearly see the huge bulge in the center of his underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My eyes widened in disbelief.
