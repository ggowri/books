What are you looking at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Elliott looking in my direction blankly, Giselle tugged doubtfully at Elliott's sleeve and subconsciously turned around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam didn't realize what was happening. He saw a bunny toy, immediately brought it to me, and said with a smile, "Madeline, this bunny toy is great. It can sing and talk to the baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't speak but just looked ahead quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was shocked. He stared at me blankly for a few seconds and finally lowered his head guiltily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought I could totally ignore what he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when I saw them together, my heart still ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't he firmly say that he was framed and that he didn't care about Giselle's child at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, judging by his behavior, he clearly cared very much about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, how could he accompany Giselle to the maternal and baby store and buy so many products at one time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My baby would be born with no father, while Giselle's child could always be loved by the Bryant family. A hatred immediately surged inside me when I thought about that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would remember all the insults and hurt that the Bryant family had done to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the future, I would never let them know that I gave birth to this child. Even if one day they knew it was the child of the Bryant family, I would never let them get close to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I swore inwardly. However, at this time, Giselle eyed me and sneered, "What are you doing here? This isn't where you should be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I spoke, Adam said angrily, "Giselle, don't go too far. You could come to a maternal and baby store. Why Madeline couldn't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Adam, Giselle immediately crossed her arms and mocked, "Adam, it's you. I didn't expect you to come to such a pass. You're actually Madeline's errand boy now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam had long been fed up with Giselle. Hearing her words, he became angrier and retorted sarcastically, "No matter what, I behaved more decently than you. You shamelessly had a child out of wedlock and became a mistress. Besides, I'm not an errand boy. I'm Madeline's assistant. You'd better be polite to my boss. Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude, even though you were my college classmate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, you... Elliott, they're so mean to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam exposed Giselle's true color in front of several store clerks. Giselle was arrogant just now. However, after Adam hit a nerve, her face turned red. She was annoyed, but she didn't know how to refute Adam and had to ask Elliott for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott never looked at her from beginning to end. He just kept staring at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about Adam's words and my sudden visit to the maternal and baby store, he noticed something. Elliott pushed Giselle away, walked in front of me, and stared at my belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you come here? Are you... Are you pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced down subconsciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, I wore an oversized dress. Although my belly was slightly bulging, it appeared flat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my head, looked him in the eyes, and said sarcastically, "Can't I come to the maternity and baby store if I'm not pregnant? If I hadn't come, I wouldn't have known you are so immersed in being a father. Congratulations!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="501.html">« Prev</a><a href="503.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
