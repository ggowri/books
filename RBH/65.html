Quinn, lend me your arm for a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded. Then, I took a deep breath. I quickly adjusted my state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Quinn extended his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I grabbed his arm. After I symbolically knocked on the door twice, Quinn and I walked in together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, we came to see you again. Have you been feeling any better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I entered, I immediately asked loudly. My voice was very loud. I was afraid that Elliott wouldn't be able to hear me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We suddenly burst in, catching Giselle off guard. Immediately, she looked up. When she saw me, she sweetly exclaimed, "Hello!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, you came."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Giselle's attitude towards me remained respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Elliott heard her shout, he immediately turned around. The moment he saw Quinn and me holding hands, Elliott's face instantly darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in front of Giselle, he did not get angry. He just coldly said, "How did you all come here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to see Giselle. She was your lifesaver, you know. Giselle, are you still feeling unwell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I let go of Quinn's hand. Then, I walked up and symbolically shook Giselle's hand. Afterward, I sat down on the other side of the hospital bed. With a smile on my face, I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't and wouldn't show my vulnerable side to them anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was much better, Mrs. Bryant. You were too kind. In that situation, anyone would have done the same as I did."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle looked at me friendly. There was sincerity on her face. I could feel that at that moment, she had not developed any special feelings for Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not everyone is as brave as you. You need to take good care of your injuries, you know? If you need anything, just let us know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said with a fake smile on my face. And I could feel that Elliott had been staring at me while I was saying these words. Moreover, there was clearly a look of displeasure on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did you go last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, last night, Quinn and I were drinking together. Later, I got drunk and couldn't go back by myself. So Quinn carried me back to the hotel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said indifferently. I was too lazy to care about what he was feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face turned darker in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly stood up from his seat. Immediately, he coldly said, "Come here, I want to talk to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finished speaking and then turned and walked out. In his tall and slender figure, there seemed to be endless anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I exchanged a glance simultaneously. He gave me an encouraging look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I silently followed Elliott out. I had just reached the corner of the hallway when he suddenly turned around. Immediately, he forcefully pressed me against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was startled by his actions and asked, "What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I was the one who should have asked that question. What is going on with you now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott angrily stared at me. His lips were tightly pressed into a straight line. His face was dark, exuding an impending burst of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended to look at him casually. I crossed my arms and said lightly,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't do anything either. I just had a drink, that's all. Elliott, didn't you used to stay out all night too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you are now seeking revenge on me, right? Are you using my good friend to get back at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott chuckled coldly. His voice was lowered to a whisper. Moreover, there was a chilling tone in his voice. He grabbed my collar tightly. His expression was terrifying, as if he was about to devour me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="64.html">« Prev</a><a href="66.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
