We also invested a considerable amount of money when purchasing it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally getting to the point, Jacob clearly breathed a sigh of relief and said with feigned difficulty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's phone kept ringing incessantly. Sylvia continued to send him messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You name your price. If it's suitable, you can come to the Bryant Group tomorrow to sign the contract."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott asked succinctly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This drama was recently offered for five million dollars, but after evaluating it, we believed it could be sold for even higher..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob naturally knew Elliott's identity and, collaborating with a large corporation, he certainly had to raise the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That will be five million five hundred thousand dollars. If possible, you can come to the Bryant Group tomorrow to sign the contract. I have something to attend to beforehand, so let me ask my wife to stay and have dinner with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what Sylvia said to Elliott. He obviously couldn't sit still and, after directly stating the price, hastily left the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched as my husband rushed out for another woman, leaving me alone in the private room to accompany the guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This feeling was really uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to think that he didn't care much about Sylvia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's performance, however, repeatedly challenged my understanding of my emotions towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, even towards Sylvia, he was very attentive, but when it came to me, he never showed the slightest bit of care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was he so heartless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I loved him for so many years, and yet he didn't feel a single bit of it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What makes women like Sylvia better than me in the past?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who is his most beloved person, Giselle, and what exactly makes her better than me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did Elliott care so much about them and not care about me at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Elliott's figure recede into the distance, I was momentarily lost in thought and couldn't help but feel a little sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, I can accept the price that Mr. Bryant just mentioned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob saw me staring blankly and thought I was waiting for him to speak, so he said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jacob, I am willing to offer six million dollars to buy the rights to your play, but the buyer is not the Bryant Group, it is the Glory Group. If you agree, we can sign the contract now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I was destined not to obtain love, I will focus on my career for the rest of my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly calmed down and took the opportunity to say to Jacob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the Glory Group you mentioned the same Glory Group that started with machinery?" Jacob was taken aback. "May I ask what is your relationship with Glory Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be honest, Glory Group is my father's company. I currently work at Glory Group. The Bryant Group has many projects, like this kind of TV series, even if the rights are bought, there is a high possibility that they won't be filmed. But Glory Group is genuinely interested in developing in the field of TV series. We are willing to offer a price that is $500,000 higher than the Bryant Group, it's up to you to consider."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I identified myself and said to Jacob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob had some doubts. "But, you are the president's wife of the Bryant Group, whether it's you or the Bryant Group, isn't it the same?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it was different. Mr. James, would you be willing to cooperate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked with a smile, unwilling to give any further explanations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, you are all family. It shouldn't matter who I sign with. I'll think about it. But I didn't bring the contract with me tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, I was prepared early."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took out the two contracts that were in the bag and handed them to Jacob.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="24.html">« Prev</a><a href="26.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
