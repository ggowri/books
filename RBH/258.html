He looked at it suspiciously for a long time. Finally, his eyes rested on the words of the final diagnosis, which was congenital infertility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These few words were enough to explain everything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn raised his head in shock. Noticing my uncontrollable tears, he asked me in a panic, "Is this why you are sad today? Did you go for a physical examination?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, tears still pouring out of my eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The emotions I had finally calmed down suddenly surged through me again, and the extreme pain made me speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn couldn't guess the reason anyway. He quickly brought a tissue and handed it to me. Then, he patted my shoulder in an attempt to comfort me, but suddenly, words failed him, and he appeared pretty panicked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, he asked, "Why did you suddenly go for this examination? What did the doctor say? What do you think now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wiped the tears from my face with a tissue, took a deep breath, and tried my best to calm down before whispering, "Cormac forced us to do it, and their family must also know the result. Due to my infertility, Elliott will ask me for a divorce soon."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, I couldn't help but want to shed tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked at me in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then divorce him. Haven't you wanted to break up with him for a long time? Divorce is not terrible. As for the other problems you raised, there are solutions. Nowadays, medical technology is advanced. You can try in vitro fertilization and seek help from surrogacy organizations. Many methods are worth exploring. Why do you break down over such a trivial matter? You are useless!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's way of comforting others was unique.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, I believed my life was without hope. Yet, I must confess, after hearing his words, I suddenly realized I wasn't at rock bottom, and things weren't as dire as I had imagined.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stopped crying instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do want to divorce him, but not now. Let me tell you, as soon as this result came out, Giselle immediately provoked me. If Elliott and I divorce, she will immediately become his wife."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I made no concealment to Quinn. In my subconscious, I had regarded him as a close friend of mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, he seemed to have noticed a long time ago the subtle relationship between Giselle and Elliott, but I had no idea how he discovered it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand your thoughts. You can't accept Giselle and Elliot getting married. Calm down. We'll be at the club soon, and I'll analyze it for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn patted me on the shoulder and pointed outside.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="257.html">« Prev</a><a href="259.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
