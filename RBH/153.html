He held me all night long, and several times I could feel him desperately restraining himself. But perhaps due to my attitude, he ultimately didn't do anything to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I haven't been hugged for so many years, and I feel very uncomfortable. At first, I couldn't fall asleep, but later, I was too tired and unknowingly fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott left after daybreak. He told me he had to rush back to Louis City for a meeting. He asked if I wanted to go with him, but I decided to go back to the film set to take a look, so I didn't travel with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Elliott left, the room immediately felt empty, his lingering presence still permeating the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay on the bed blankly for a while, and then suddenly it rang. My phone was still turned off, and all the events from last night were so sudden that I didn't even remember about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was suddenly taken away from the bar by Elliott like this, Paige and Adam must have been frantic, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly found my phone and charged it up. Sure enough, as soon as the phone turned on, messages came flooding in like an explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige sent me dozens of messages, made over ten missed calls, and Adam also kept leaving me messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that they were still trying to contact me until midnight, I couldn't help but feel guilty, so I quickly called Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige almost answered the phone in a split second. As soon as she picked up the call, she shouted at a high decibel, "Oh my goodness, you finally answered the phone! I was digging up the entire Louis City last night to find you. Seriously, why were you turned off the whole night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt guilty, so I had to force a smile and say, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Last night, Elliott suddenly showed up at the bar and took me away. Later, my phone ran out of battery and I didn't have time to charge it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for later reviewing the surveillance footage and finding out that you were taken away by Elliott, I would have called the police last night! I can't believe you guys, what kind of game are you playing?" Paige complained on the phone, and then she suddenly said with a mischievous tone, "I didn't have time to charge all night, you guys wouldn't happen to be...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, they watched the surveillance footage and found out where I had gone. Hearing her say this, I instantly felt much relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, if I let them worry and be scared all night, it would truly be my fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Me and Elliott? Impossible, stop imagining things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I naturally knew what she meant, so I quickly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe it at all. Elliott ran all the way to the bar in Louis City just to confront you, and you didn't even check your phone all night. How could nothing happen between you two? To be honest, it seems like Elliott has been showing some interest in you lately. This doesn't seem like something he would do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had probably been curious all night, and at this moment, she wished she could ask everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, if it was a normal relationship between a man and a woman, everything that was supposed to happen did happen, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, only Elliott and I knew the situation between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never mind that, where are you? Are Adam and you together? I'm looking for you both!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to give any more explanations, so I immediately changed the subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am at the hotel contracted by your crew, right outside your room. Where are you? Either let Adam come and bring you back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hotel where Elliott was staying was not far from the hotel we had contracted. I gave the location, and Adam quickly drove over to pick me up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me, Adam also exclaimed, and finally, he curiously asked me, "Madeline, was that man who carried you into the car last night your husband? He's so handsome and charismatic, and his car is also very expensive. The Lamborghini must be worth millions of dollars, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam obviously saw Elliott in the surveillance video, so he curiously asked me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="152.html">« Prev</a><a href="154.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
