Quinn and I grabbed the paper and headed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seem to be in a good mood today. Did something good happen?" Quinn asked with a smile as we walked along the road, noticing my constant laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have a guess. I'll tell you if you are right," I smiled and winked at Quinn. Unable to contain my happiness, I twirled around in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being midwinter, with Christmas just around the corner, today's weather was delightful. It was a sunny day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wore a goose-yellow sweater paired with a white knit skirt and white sneakers. A light brown beret adorned my head, complementing my subtle makeup. Against the backdrop of the warm sun and lush greenery, I must have stood out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I finished twirling and looked back at Quinn, I caught a glimpse of astonishment in his eyes, but it was soon replaced by a mysterious smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you celebrating something on Twitter? Knowing you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn truly seemed to understand me like no other. It was surprising how accurately he guessed what was on my mind. I was taken aback, exclaiming, "You're really good! How did you know I was happy about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his accurate guess, Quinn smiled, "Do you think I can't see through your little scheme? But don't get too excited just yet. I gather that Bryant Group's PR team is already in action. Check it out. The trending topics have been removed, and many negative comments have been deleted. Their PR skills is really something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to know I was behind it all and promptly reminded me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Quinn incredulously. The more I interacted with him, the more mysterious he seemed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite appearing indifferent to everything, he seemed to know everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but playfully punch his chest. "Aren't you always just fooling around? How do you suddenly know about all this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, his smile as warm and comforting as the winter sun beneath the clear sky, "That's because I care about anything that concerns you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were so sincere that they made my heart skip a beat. I couldn't help but look up at him deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as I felt moved, suddenly, someone called my name from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, is it you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice sounded familiar, and I froze, hastily turning my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I were almost at the entrance of Serenity Villa, with the supermarket just around the corner to the left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected to encounter him here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dressed casually in sportswear and held some groceries he had just bought from the supermarket. He looked like he lived here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, I was surprised, then delighted, and immediately rushed forward, smiling as I asked, "Oh, it's you! What are you doing here?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="421.html">« Prev</a><a href="423.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
