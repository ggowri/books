I instinctively blurted out, but soon, a strong man stuffed a towel into my mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little beauty, don't worry. We will definitely serve you right tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong man looked at me evilly and couldn't wait to pounce on me, tearing my clothes apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the other man had already positioned himself behind the camera. He turned it on, pointed it at my angle, and started shooting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really wanted to struggle, but no matter how hard I tried, my hands felt useless. I couldn't exert any strength at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong man had already started unbuttoning me. The immense feeling of humiliation forced me to shake my head desperately. I couldn't help but shed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For so many years, Elliott never slept with me, and until now, I was still a virgin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I never thought that I would be inexplicably kidnapped and about to be raped tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who exactly wanted to harm me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it sent by Elliott?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how ruthless he was, he wouldn't go so far as to harm me, right? After all, I was still his nominal wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was lost in thinking when I saw Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day on the rooftop, I clearly heard Tom and Jade's conversation. They discussed and planned to target me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, undoubtedly it was the most vicious move to have someone rape me, take pictures of me, and ruin my reputation, enough to make me infamous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, I broke out in a cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to struggle, but the water that the driver handed me must have been spiked with something. At this moment, I felt like a helpless lamb being slaughtered, completely powerless to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the ugly man in front of me, who was pouncing on me like a vicious wolf, I broke down and started crying uncontrollably as he was about to tear my clothes apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just at that moment, a noise suddenly came from the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two strong men heard the noise and quickly turned their heads, shouting loudly, "Who is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! You dare to do this on my turf. Are you looking for death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man's roar came from the room, and immediately after, several bodyguards rushed in and effortlessly pinned the two strong men tightly against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The familiar sound rang in my ears, and I opened my eyes to find Quinn appearing before me like a heavenly soldier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did he suddenly appear here?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="31.html">« Prev</a><a href="33.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
