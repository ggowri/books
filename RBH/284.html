But then, he unexpectedly silenced me by covering my lips with his.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sweet, refreshing taste of coconut juice flowed from his mouth into mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to swallow it in small sips. My heart, which had just calmed down, was now racing again and almost leaping out of my throat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like he didn't want to stop showering me with affection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though I wanted to drink on my own, he insisted otherwise. So, in the most intimate manner, he slowly fed me food and drinks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his extreme indulgence, I felt like I turned into a baby in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unfamiliar feeling was so intoxicating that it made me forget all my past feelings of love, hate, embarrassment, and humiliation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until my stomach was finally full that he stopped and then helped me up. After he settled the bill, we left and returned to the apartment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing I was exhausted, he refused to let me walk. He carried me into and out of the car, up the stairs, and into the elevator, only letting me down when he placed me on the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he felt relieved and took off his sweat-drenched shirt before heading into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of running water quickly filled the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I collapsed on the soft bed, leisurely browsing the news on my phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Quinn suddenly sent a video along with a message, "The two of you are trending tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was slightly stunned, then quickly played the video. It turned out to be a headline video from a certain entertainment media, with a staggering number of views and comments.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video began with Elliott wearing a mask, playing the piano on stage, and standing on stage celebrating my birthday.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, these scenes didn't reveal much since he was masked, and his identity was unknown.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the footage of us kissing and embracing in the corridor as we removed our masks was also edited into the video's ending. Moreover, the video clearly showed our faces.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that Elliott and I were suddenly exposed to the public eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, both in the past and now, was a favorite subject of both the entertainment and financial sections in the news.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The title of the video boldly read, "Elliott singing love songs, passionately kissing his girlfriend whose identity was revealed."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video included a clip of Elliott playing the piano and singing on stage. Despite the average audio quality, his charming voice and singing still elicited screams from girls in the comments section.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being uploaded only half an hour ago, the video had already surpassed millions of views, with comments continuously increasing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was right. We were really trending tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but smile bitterly. I never expected to become the center of gossip in such a way tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, Elliott and I were legally married. There was nothing wrong with us being lovey-dovey with each other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I clicked on the video and watched it again from start to finish.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Elliott had finished taking his shower. He walked out of the bathroom with only a towel wrapped around his torso, and he was puzzled to see me staring at my phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you watching?" he asked.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="283.html">« Prev</a><a href="285.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
