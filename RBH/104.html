Last time I saw you in the hospital, I knew that you cared about every woman who appeared around Elliott. As a friend, of course, I was there to help you through your troubles!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His explanation, on the other hand, sounded reasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I distinctly remember in the previous life, they had a natural fondness for Giselle, but were very dismissive of me. Moreover, back then, Quinn always treated Giselle like a sister and was just as concerned about everything regarding her as he is about me now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is the reason for such a big change in him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I frowned at him, realizing that he was even more like a fog than Elliott, and I couldn't see him clearly no matter how hard I tried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even if you trick Rowan into taking Giselle to the concert, she could still come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, however, smiled indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I had arranged this scam, of course I would do everything possible to prevent Giselle from coming back. Don't ask too many details about it, just tell me, how do you want to thank me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This matter has already been settled, and there is no point in further investigating the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why Giselle lied to Elliott, saying that she was being held captive by Rowan, seems to be nothing more than an excuse for her to salvage some impression points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, how do you want me to thank you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I then asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, however, laughed again. He laughed brightly, and the diamond earring on his left ear sparkled along with his smile, making him look so radiant. He said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's leave it as a debt for now, and when the day comes that you owe me enough favors, then you can repay me all at once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I couldn't pay it back by then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't pay it back..." he suddenly leaned in close to my ear, seductively saying, "then you'll have to repay it with your body! After all, I know that you and Elliott will eventually break up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I trembled all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't tell Quinn anything, but he saw through all my thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what exactly did he mean by this statement?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does he like me, by any chance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, this is absolutely impossible. We didn't have much interaction before, and besides, I am not the type he likes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, bold, dared to joke at my expense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately concluded that he was joking with me, so I quickly approached him and started punching and kicking his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, however, snatched the wine glass from my hand, regardless of the fact that I had just taken a sip, and proceeded to drink it all in one go. Afterward, he ran away with a smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, there was a possibility between us, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pfft</span><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who wanted to be with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one day I left Elliott, I would definitely stay away from his circle and everything related to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt extremely contemptuous in my heart, so I caught up with Quinn, grabbed his collar, and when I saw a bucket of ice next to me, I suddenly had a mischievous idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I grabbed the ice bucket and without saying a word, I poured it directly into his collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's face twisted in an instant as he froze, and he let out a loud cry. Immediately after, his whole body couldn't help but tremble, and his trembling appearance made me burst into laughter on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is the first time in so many years that I laughed so heartily.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="103.html">« Prev</a><a href="105.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
