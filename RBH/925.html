I didn't cherish what I had before. If you give me another chance, I won't make the same mistake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said softly, gently wiping away my tears and pulling me into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice had a thick nasal tone. Just as I was about to look up, a tear fell on my face&mdash;it was his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he truly remorseful and regretful of the past?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he genuinely feel guilty for not always being there, for not holding my hand through everything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of emotions surged in my heart, and tears started flowing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you realize it before? You signed the divorce papers so easily, let go of my hand so easily, and even got engaged to someone else. Did you ever consider my feelings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I vented my long-suppressed emotions, hitting his chest with my fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong. No excuses, wrong is wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said in a low voice, looking at me with pain in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He no longer made excuses for himself like he used to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He admitted it was all his fault, that he didn't cherish what we had and let go too easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how I felt when I found out I was pregnant? Do you know how I felt seeing you with Giselle shopping for baby stuff? Do you know what I went through until childbirth? Elliott, you know nothing, you only know how to hurt me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I cried and vented in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, it's my fault. I hurt you and let you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He matched my emotions more than ever, holding my hand and repeatedly apologizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never used to do this, showing he was truly reflecting and learning to grow and manage relationships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I wouldn't dare act out or vent my frustrations in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One look from him, and I'd suppress everything inside, unable to voice my grievances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know? You jerk, you scumbag, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I cursed him but then saw the hurt on his face and couldn't continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew he had his own grievances too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because this wasn't the outcome he wanted either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want the divorce, Giselle's pregnancy wasn't his doing, and he didn't want to be apart from me... I knew he had his own pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being apart for so long hurt him too. Otherwise, why would he lose so much weight and come to Norch City alone to save me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did cherish me, trying to hold on. It was me who decided not to look back...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, all my grievances turned into understanding and forgiveness for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe this tangled and conflicting emotion is what they call love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly smiled, and he couldn't help but smile too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We cried and laughed, looking at each other like fools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still upset? It's okay, you can vent however you want tonight. I'll be your punching bag."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pinched my cheek, his eyes full of affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm hungry, Elliott. I want to eat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's a great Korean restaurant nearby that's open 24/7. Can't sleep anyway, want to go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, let's go now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all that, I was wide awake and starving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing about food, I immediately wanted to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as I threw off the covers, I realized I was completely naked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throwing off the covers exposed me entirely to Elliott again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gasped and tried to cover myself, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott quickly pinned me down, his eyes filled with a fierce desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was hoarse and deep:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really want to devour you, can I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely not!" I blurted out instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll go cool off in the bathroom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, he behaved and didn't touch me. But after a moment, he couldn't resist and gently brushed his lips against mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's lips were thick, like jelly. His gentle kisses reignited the desire I had just managed to suppress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I secretly hoped he would continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he obediently left and went to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, I heard the sound of running water. It seemed he was using a shower to calm himself down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I got up from the bed, quickly dressed, and took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood by the window to get some fresh air. By the time Elliott finished his shower, I had calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott changed clothes quickly, and we left the room together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He often traveled to Korea for business, so he knew the place much better than I did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He led me a few hundred meters to a Korean restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place was small but well-decorated. The aroma of kimchi and ramen greeted us as we entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it was late, the restaurant was still bustling with customers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We chose a table in the corner, and Elliott ordered a lot of food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you order so much? We can't finish it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly tried to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orson is bringing your two friends over. They've been looking for you all night. I just sent them our location."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's words left me momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night's events had been so intense that I almost forgot about Fiona and Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's reminder made me realize I was in Korea with my friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I vanished from the bar so suddenly; of course, they would be worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly told Elliott, "Give me your phone. I need to call them. I almost forgot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I already informed them. They know you're safe with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott handed me his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screen was on, and it still had my photo as the wallpaper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found Fiona's contact and was about to text her when Paige's loud voice startled me from behind:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you scared us to death! We thought you were kidnapped!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned around to see Paige and Fiona entering the restaurant with Orson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige rushed over and hugged me tightly!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="924.html">« Prev</a><a href="926.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
