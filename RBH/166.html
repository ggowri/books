It gives me a dramatic sense of amusement, making me shake my head and say with a smile, "Mom, I am already very satisfied that you came to see me. Elliott said that my injuries are not serious, and I will be discharged from the hospital in a few days. Don't worry about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The injury on your head should not be underestimated. You should stay in the hospital for a few more days for observation. I heard from Elliott that you are very busy with work now, but in my opinion, if you are too busy, it's better to stay at home. Our family is wealthy and we don't need you to work outside. Just take good care of the family." Jasper also came forward at this time, his tone serious but showing rare concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I know that our family doesn't need me to earn money, but after all, I have graduated from college and I also want to realize my own value, so as to avoid the growing gap between me and Elliott in the future. In the past, I was immature and didn't understand the importance of managing things properly, but now I understand. Don't worry, I will balance my work and family." I quickly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is a precious way to express loyalty to them, and in order to avoid Giselle creating too good of an impression on them in the future, I must take the initiative to shape myself into a good daughter-in-law who understands the overall situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, when Jasper heard me say this, a hint of relief appeared on his face: "It's best if you can think like that. Elliott is very busy, and I have already retired. He does need a capable assistant by his side..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper had just started speaking when Laura interrupted him, retorting, "What kind of help? Our family isn't lacking money, can't we hire someone to help? The most important thing for Madeline right now is to recover her health and have more children for our family. Madeline, don't listen to Jasper. Let me tell you, for the next two years, your main task should be to have children. Oh, by the way, I brought you some medicine and the freshest fruits from the orchard. Once you've healed, you can start eating them, understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura always seems to be absent, but whenever she shows up, she urges me to have a baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was at a loss whether to laugh or cry, and at this moment, several servants had already placed a whole basket of fresh fruits and a large stack of medicine in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at those bags of medicine, I couldn't help but think of myself in the previous life, who was forced to try various medications. I really didn't know what to say. Fortunately, at that moment, Elliott walked in carrying oatmeal porridge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Mom, how did you come here?" Elliott was taken aback when he saw his own parents and quickly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My good daughter-in-law got injured for the sake of the company, of course we had to come and see. How could you let her go to the construction site alone?" Laura scolded Elliott directly, without any hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face immediately fell: "Mom, I have grown up, can you please not scold me like a child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no matter how old you are, you are still a child in my eyes. Besides, you keep saying that you have grown up, but I haven't seen any evidence of that. It has been over two years since you got married, and you still don't have any children. You claim to have grown up, but in my opinion, you should go to the hospital and get a thorough examination in the urology department!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's mouth twitched, and he stared at Laura in disbelief, "Mom, how could you be like this? Dad, just take Mom back home. You keep asking us to have children every day. Why didn't you try harder to have more kids back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that Elliott would also have a moment of contradicting Laura, and his words instantly made Jasper's face fall.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="165.html">« Prev</a><a href="167.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
