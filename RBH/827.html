Jane, ever the thoughtful one, probably anticipated we wouldn't be returning, so she had given our bags to Barry to bring over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had intended to grab my luggage, but Elliott, ever the considerate one, took it upon himself to carry it for me. Then, taking my hand in his, he led me towards the boarding gate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rain fell on Vespera City, the air carrying a damp chill.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me clad only in a thin shirt, Elliott, fearing I might catch a cold, draped his jacket over my shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he's gentle, considerate, and understanding. So perfect, it hardly seems like him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, his thoughtful gestures would have inevitably stirred my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I don't feel a hint of excitement. Instead, images of Quinn keep popping up in my mind, so much so that even holding hands with Elliott gives me a sense of guilt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the airport, Barry had our boarding passes ready for us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We passed through security, one after the other, and then made our way to the VIP lounge to wait for our flight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I plopped down, idly fiddling with my phone out of sheer boredom. Suddenly, a message from Quinn popped up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The information is a snapshot, capturing a moment where Elliott and I are hand in hand, ascending the airport escalator together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The angle of the photo was carefully chosen, making us look quite the perfect pair, intimate and close in the captured frame.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in reality, Elliott merely steadied me in the elevator, then promptly let go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who's tailing us?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I paused for a moment, then saw a message from Quinn pop up: "Guess who sent this to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn seldom leaves me guessing, but this time, he did. Immediately, my intuition kicked in and I blurted out, "Could it be Lisa?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're really smart," Quinn replied to me swiftly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I jerked my head up, instantly scanning my surroundings with a wary eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had barely lifted my gaze when I saw Lisa stride into the waiting room. She was clad in a dark green trench coat that fell to her mid-thighs, her feet adorned with red high heels. Her curly hair cascaded freely down her shoulders, and she wore sunglasses that added an air of mystery to her entrance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, she really did show up here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, you're here too? Are you also headed to Hoswich City?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon spotting Elliott, Lisa immediately rushed over with warmth, her voice still raspy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh, it's you?" Elliott asked, his surprise evident in his casual tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm heading to Hoswich City for some business," Lisa stated nonchalantly. She then turned to me, "I must say, I'm a bit surprised to see Ms. Mayers and Mr. Bryant traveling together."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's my wife. Why does that surprise you?" Elliott retorted instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa clapped a hand over her mouth, her eyes wide with surprise. "Really?" she exclaimed. "But at his last birthday bash, Mr. Woods announced to everyone that Ms. Mayers was his girlfriend."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was instantly taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Lisa showed up, I had a hunch she was no good.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, she's now uttering these words that make me cringe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? Did he really say that?" Elliott suddenly stood up, raising his voice in question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because Quinn and I are tight. He had me pretend to be his girlfriend to ward off the advances of the women around him. Elliott knows exactly what's going on between Quinn and me. Ms. Fox, why do you stir up trouble the moment you show up? What do you gain from trying to sabotage my relationship with Elliott?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm no longer the weakling I once was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I locked eyes with Lisa, my voice icy as I demanded answers.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="826.html">« Prev</a><a href="828.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
