They served authentic local dishes from Hoswich, with the walls adorned with the history of the restaurant's development.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We chose a corner booth. As noon approached, the restaurant was bustling with many customers and was quickly filled up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I both lowered our heads to peruse the menu, silently selecting our desired dishes before informing the waiter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ordering, I gazed out the window. It was deep autumn, with golden leaves carpeting the street outside, creating a melancholic yet charming atmosphere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally breaking the silence, Elliott spoke slowly. "How long will you be staying in Louis City?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least half a month," I replied casually.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn's new store in Louis City is about to open. Avoid meeting him alone," Elliott warned, his tone revealing his concern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raising my head, I smiled meaningfully, "And what about you? Can you avoid meeting Giselle?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's expression stiffened with a hint of displeasure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle works at the Bryant Group, and she's currently spending every day with Grandpa. These two matters are not to be conflated."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Elliott intended to continue his relationship with Giselle but forbade me from meeting Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled faintly and remarked, "Quinn's new store opening, and since I'm in Louis City, I definitely have to show support. In my view, these two matters are essentially the same."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's expression darkened further.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seem to enjoy arguing with me now. Giselle is so young, why do you overthink things?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I retorted, "Quinn is your best friend, he's just been a bit more attentive to me as a friend. Why do you overthink it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We locked eyes, and despite my attempt to ease the tension between us, the mention of Giselle still irked me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, Elliott stared at me, equally puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know Quinn, I understand his intentions towards you better than you do."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crossing my arms, I looked at Quinn, feeling a sense of irony growing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know Giselle too. You think she's young, but she's quite cunning. I understand her better than you do."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly grew angry, his gaze cold as he glared at me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I invited you to dinner not to argue with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And neither did I.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for wanting to improve our relationship, I wouldn't have subjected myself to this dinner with him in such circumstances.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the futility of our argument, which only served to diminish our mutual regard, I suppressed my anger and looked out the window, refusing to say another word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the waiter brought our dishes. They showcased the renowned local Hoswich cuisine, which was prepared with authentic flavors and techniques.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the delicious spread before me, I had lost my appetite.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avoiding eye contact with Elliott, I gazed out the window, only to spot a very familiar figure hurrying towards the hospital with a takeout box in hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Isn't that Rowan?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="242.html">« Prev</a><a href="244.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
