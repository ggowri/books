I felt dirty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's movements suddenly came to a halt. He looked at my belly affectionately, a hint of disappointment flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you feel dirty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You had a lot of these tender interactions with Giselle too, right? Knowing that her child is not yours, you then turned to me and showed affection toward me and the child in my belly? Elliott, don't treat someone else's child as your own. Is this your life's pleasure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but mock, with obvious humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, didn't care. It was strange, the man who used to get so angry whenever he didn't receive respect now seemed to have truly let go of his dignity. No matter how much I mocked him, he didn't argue back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly let go of my hand and told the driver to stop the car. I thought he had finally decided to let me get off, and was about to push open the car door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he was the first to get out of the car and went straight to the back, opening the trunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had just gotten off the car when he walked over, holding a delicate gift bag, and handed it to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This was the gift I bought for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gift?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This vocabulary is still very fresh to me because in the past, Elliott rarely gave me gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he spent his days dealing with various matters of the Bryant Group, being a workaholic who had no understanding of leisure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though we had a sweet period later, during that time, he never thought about giving me any surprises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything has changed now, but he still remembers about giving gifts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, but I didn't need it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I coldly glanced at the bag and was not curious about what was inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here you go. You can use it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect it, but he directly stuffed the gift bag into my hands. Then, he pinched my face and pointed to his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You hated me, so I got out of the car. I asked the driver to take you to wherever you wanted to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could react, Elliott had already started walking toward the side of the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We had already arrived on a main road, so there were many taxis. However, in the blink of an eye, he had already gotten into a taxi and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably gave instructions to his new driver. The driver got out of the car and made a respectful gesture toward me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, please get in the car. I will drive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My gaze instinctively turned toward the departing taxi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my impression, Elliott had a serious case of OCD. It was impossible for him to take </span><span>public transportation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he has unexpectedly left his private luxury car and driver to me, and he went away alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was originally planning to refuse, but then I thought about it and realized that he had caused me a lot of harm in the past, so there was no need for me to refuse his goodwill now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I got back into the car. The driver quickly started the car. After I told him the address of Glory Group, we set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gift that Elliott gave me is still in my hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The journey was quite long. I held the gift and kept looking at it repeatedly. I gradually became curious about this gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant spent the whole day queuing to buy this gift. He said you would definitely like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The newly hired driver was not as silent as Toby. As if he knew what I was thinking, he suddenly spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he queue all day?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What would this gift be then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at the bag in my hand and couldn't resist opening it in the end...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="690.html">« Prev</a><a href="692.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
