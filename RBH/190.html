Quickly, she handed me the USB drive with the copied data and instructed me not to show it to anyone except myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understood it better than anyone else, without her having to say it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held the copied USB drive and returned to my office humming a tune effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as I passed by the conference room, I saw Jade gathering a group of executives for a meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the glass window, I saw her eager to show off her own style, impatiently wanting to dominate Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous life, by this time, she had already become the vice president and gained actual control over Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this life, under my obstruction, she still only holds the position of Operations Director at Glory Group, and there is still some distance between her and controlling Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin doesn't trust her as much as he did in the past, and he doesn't give her full authority. But I also understand that I'm not yet mature enough, and currently, Austin has no one else available to use. Some tasks can only be accomplished with Jade's help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Austin and I couldn't show our attitude towards Jade too obviously, we still had to act out the play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most urgent and crucial thing is for me to quickly grow and become a qualified assistant to Austin. Only when I truly have the ability to compete with Jade, will everything that happened in the past life not happen again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stopped outside the conference room and watched for a while, and Jade clearly saw me too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We exchanged glances with each other, and then I smiled slightly, turned around, and gracefully entered my office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After closing the office door, I immediately called Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surprisingly, you actually called me on your own initiative?" Quinn received my call, looking very cheerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe," I chuckled and then asked him, "Quinn, I want to secure a spot at Hoswich No.1 High School. Can you handle it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just lied to Katrina. Actually, I didn't even know the principal of Hoswich No.1 High School.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, subconsciously, I felt that I could handle this matter by finding someone, and the first person that came to my mind was Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to do at Hoswich No.1 High School? Relearn?" Quinn asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, how is that possible? It's my relative's daughter, she missed the cutoff score for Hoswich No.1 High School by a few points and wants to use connections. Tell me the truth, can you handle it?" I asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is a way, though..." Quinn chuckled on the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want? Just tell me, as long as you can do it, I will definitely fulfill your request," I said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Invite me to ten meals, and I get to choose the restaurants. How about that?" Quinn said with a cheerful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, that's settled then." I didn't expect it, but Quinn really had the ability. Whatever the matter, finding him was indeed finding the right person. I exclaimed with great joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That evening, please take me out for dinner. I know of a newly opened restaurant that is quite good," Quinn said immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I can't. I'm leaving for Louis City in a little while and I'll be staying there for a while. How about this, I'll invite you when I come back from Louis City, okay?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Louise City? I was actually planning to go there in a couple of days too. I plan to open another branch over there. I just rented a space and now I'm getting ready to renovate it," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, Quinn was also going to Louis City.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="189.html">« Prev</a><a href="191.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
