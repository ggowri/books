Have you forgotten what you did to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, my mom's emotions surged. She pointed at him and couldn't help but scold him harshly </span><span>in public</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her loud voice immediately drew the attention of </span><span>many</span><span> passersby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, I hurried to my mom's side and whispered:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, calm down. It's not good to cause a scene</span><span>. </span><span>People </span><span>are</span><span> watching. I'll explain everything to you later.</span><span> C</span><span>ome</span><span> </span><span>home first</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I spoke, I </span><span>dropped tons of hints</span><span> to my mom with my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After years together, my mom and I had </span><span>known</span><span> </span><span>each other very well</span><span>. She saw that I had something I couldn't say openly, so she suppressed her anger, glared fiercely at </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, and then at me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go back, but you better explain everything later! Quinn, let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After shouting, my mom turned and walked away, not forgetting to call Quinn to follow her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> still stood there, not moving an inch. But through his terrifying gaze, I could </span><span>imagine</span><span> the turmoil raging inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn</span><span> </span><span>was </span><span>also</span><span> surprised. He looked at me, then at my mom, </span><span>planning</span><span> to say something but perhaps fearing it would </span><span>deteriorate</span><span> </span><span>Elliott</span><span>'s condition. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he turn</span><span>ed</span><span> away silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he turned, </span><span>Elliott</span><span> suddenly made a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swiftly stepped in front of Quinn</span><span> </span><span>and grabbed his collar:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Didn&rsquo;t</span><span> you </span><span>owe me an </span><span>exp</span><span>lanation for</span><span> this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked at him, </span><span>surprisingly</span><span> calm:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have nothing to explain. </span><span>You</span><span> should ask your doctor what's going on</span><span>, not me</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean, Quinn Woods?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span>, suffering from amnesia, didn't understand what </span><span>Quinn </span><span>was referring to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurried to </span><span>interrupt</span><span>:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, stop! </span><span>Go home with</span><span> my mom. I'll talk to </span><span>Elliott</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked at me, and </span><span>at</span><span> that moment, his eyes were filled with </span><span>disappointment</span><span> and loneliness</span><span> that I had never seen</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if he had already made up his mind, he took a deep breath and calmly said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't </span><span>we have a</span><span> talk? If </span><span>it keeps going like this</span><span>, I'll go crazy. Madeline, </span><span>no matter how much</span><span> his amnesia</span><span> had gone</span><span>, I think we need to tell him the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What truth? What amnesia? Quinn Woods, why are you </span><span>bringing</span><span> </span><span>these up</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I got emotional, never expecting Quinn </span><span>would</span><span> choose to reveal everything</span><span> now</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span>'s treatment wasn't </span><span>done</span><span>. Dr. Jones said his condition was improving, and with a bit more time, he could fully recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Revealing everything now could harm him </span><span>deeper</span><span>. If the blood clot in his brain dislodged and endangered his life or turned him into a vegetable, how could I ever live with </span><span>that for the rest of my life</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried </span><span>hard </span><span>to stop Quinn</span><span>. B</span><span>ut days of </span><span>tolerance</span><span> </span><span>perhaps </span><span>had pushed his emotions to the </span><span>edge</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would</span><span> respect my decisions</span><span> in usual</span><span>, but this time, he insisted on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, he's an adult. He just has temporary amnesia. I believe once he knows everything, he'll make his own judgment and won't lose control of his emotions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn </span><span>said slowly. Then he pulled </span><span>Elliott</span><span>'s hand off his sleeve and looked him straight in the eye:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. Find a place to talk about your condition, and the relationship between you, me, and Madeline. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What amnesia? What condition? Quinn Woods, what are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> looked </span><span>completely</span><span> confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll explain everything to you </span><span>later</span><span>. Or, if you </span><span>don&rsquo;t mind</span><span>, we can talk here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said in a serious tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw that Quinn</span><span> </span><span>was determined to lay everything out for </span><span>Elliott</span><span>. For a moment, I didn't know what to say</span><span> to stop him</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn </span><span>walked up to me, placed his hands on my shoulders, and looked at me with </span><span>firmly</span><span>:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, </span><span>acting in</span><span> the show</span><span> is too exhausting for everyone. Most importantly, it's too hard on you. </span><span>S</span><span>ince we've all run into each other today, let's just lay it all out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn had </span><span>put everything on the table</span><span>. I knew that even if I wanted to keep hiding the truth, </span><span>Elliott</span><span> wouldn't </span><span>believe me</span><span> anymore. He would definitely </span><span>find</span><span> the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's go to that nearby caf&eacute;."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded reluctantly. Then, I walked over to my mom, handed her the breakfast I had bought, and signaled her to go back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom didn't say anything more. She </span><span>felt that</span><span> something was off, so she grabbed the breakfast and stormed back into </span><span>home</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of us headed to the nearby caf&eacute;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if fate was playing a trick, the caf&eacute; was named "Encounter," the same name as the flower shop Giselle Cole used to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of us sat down face to face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> quickly took the seat next to me, while Quinn sat across from us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We each ordered a cup of coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked down </span><span>at my phone </span><span>and </span><span>sent</span><span> a message to Dr. Jones to have an ambulance wait outside the caf&eacute;, just in case </span><span>something happened to </span><span>Elliott</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say what you need to say. Start now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, </span><span>Elliott</span><span> pursed his lips and glanced at Quinn, </span><span>starting the conversation</span><span> calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's start with the incident </span><span>that caused your</span><span> unconscious</span><span>ness</span><span>. We've all been hiding things from you, but I think with your sharpness, you must have</span><span> known</span><span> something was off, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn </span><span>said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did find it strange. Many things didn't match my memories&mdash;work, relationships, even Madeline's attitude towards me. So, what's really going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> remained calm, clearly prepared to </span><span>find out</span><span> </span><span>the truth, </span><span>everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I exchanged a glance. Then, I took a deep breath and said to </span><span>Elliott</span><span>:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It all started like this..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="901.html">« Prev</a><a href="903.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
