I worry about you, can't sleep&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The usually rational Elliott surprisingly asked about my hand in the middle of the night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Much better now. I just had Marcus help me re-dress the wound and reapply the medicine. It should be healed in a few days."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without much thought, I blurted out instinctively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus bandaged you up? Just now?" Elliott asked loudly, "You were with Marcus just now? You two were together this late?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were laced with an unprecedented tension and a hint of jealousy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was at a loss for words, quickly saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nah, I just had something to discuss with him, that's all. I'm already back at my place now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like his place is pretty close to where you guys are staying, huh?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott began to probe with increasing sharpness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I was just looking for him for something. Elliott, you don't need to be so touchy, he's with Jane now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fear I may not articulate it well, but I'll give it a shot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, who was just a bundle of nerves moments ago, suddenly found himself brimming with joy. He asked cheerfully:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? He's with Jane now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you can hit the hay now. I'm turning in too. It's getting late."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I let out a yawn, a wave of sleepiness washing over me in an instant. I turned to him and said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't sleep without you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night was long and his voice sounded increasingly lonely in the darkness, like a kitten forgotten at home by its owner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's hard to fathom that the once proud Elliott has become so reliant on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to persuade him, a sudden burst of frantic baby cries echoed from the doorway. Immediately after, a series of heavy knocks resounded at my door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the baby's cry, my heart clenched. I hastily asked,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah's burning up, Madeline. We need to rush him to the hospital, pronto!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily burst through my door, clutching Noah and calling out to me in distress. Beside her, the nanny stood, her hair disheveled and a look of terror on her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't have time to chat with Elliott, so I hastily ended the call. I immediately got up from the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sprinted over, ignoring the throbbing pain in my arm, and took Noah from Lily's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So hot&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah's body was burning up, his little face flushed red. Every now and then, he would kick his legs forcefully. His brows were furrowed, looking utterly distressed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you take his temperature? What's going on, how did he suddenly come down with a fever?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gently touched Noah's forehead, quickly asking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just took his temperature with the ear thermometer, it's 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It's all my fault. I forgot to close the door when I bathed him this afternoon. Maybe his tummy got a chill. Plus, he's been having gas these past few days, so he's running a fever now. I'm sorry, I failed to take good care of Noah."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nanny apologized to us in a flustered and remorseful manner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's an urgent matter at hand, Mom. Hurry up and get dressed, wake Dad up and have him start the car. Madam, you prepare the baby's essentials. We need to rush to the hospital."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blurted out in a rush.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Noah started crying again. I hurriedly tried to soothe him as everyone else rushed to get ready. My dad then hopped into the car, swiftly driving us to the hospital where Fiona works.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="897.html">« Prev</a><a href="899.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
