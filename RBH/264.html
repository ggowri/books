Every frame of what followed was filled with passion, portraying a deep love between us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't bear to recall it. The thought of it caused my cheeks to blush with shyness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned around, entered the bedroom, and quickly took a shower. The whirling memories in my brain gradually became calmer, but then, an inexplicable melancholy took over me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I had sex, but so what?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The report was like a heavy stone on my heart, leaving me breathless whenever it crossed my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Even if Elliott had said last night that he did not care, I knew better than anyone else that his parents and Cormac would not neglect the matter.&#8203;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Giselle's account was accurate, she was indeed the prime candidate to become Elliott's wife. So, upon discovering my infertility, they would likely hasten Giselle and Elliott's marriage to ensure they could have a child promptly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I would never allow such a thing to happen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't believe that there was really no possibility of pregnancy in my body. Maybe there would be miracles?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything last night was out of passion and impulse, but I was also mentally prepared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't just give up on this marriage, absolutely not.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in the bathroom, the more I pondered about it, the calmer I became.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a shower in a hurry and walked out quickly, wrapped in a bath towel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott still slumbered deeply. Looking at the mess on the floor and his sleeping appearance, I became more determined.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly took out a set of clothes from the closet and put them on. Without disturbing Elliott, I quietly left the bedroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I went down the stairs, and Sean was already waiting in the living room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of me, he forced a smile. He was no longer as kind and gentle as when he used to see me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, you're awake."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Sean, good morning. Long time no see," I said calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, I have prepared breakfast," Sean said, pointing to the table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, I wasn't in the slightest mood to have breakfast. I shook my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, but I'm not hungry and won't eat. I have to go out. When Elliott wakes up, please tell him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Sean's expression, I could sense that he might already be aware of something, so I lost my appetite for breakfast. All I wanted was to escape the awkwardness as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, wait a minute. I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Sean abruptly halted me, his embarrassment evident as he hesitated to speak. It was clear he wanted to tell me something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned to him and said, "What's wrong? Sean, cut to the chase if you have something to say."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly sighed heavily before walking up to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, I know the situation. Don't be too sad. There will always be other solutions, and you can also try a few more medicines. But don't feel any psychological pressure."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean's words showed his concern, which made me slightly moved. I nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Laura told you, right? Did she say anything else?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="263.html">« Prev</a><a href="265.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
