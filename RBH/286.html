Today is your birthday, and I just want you to feel happy. You don't have to think about anything else. Go take a shower now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott urged again. His look showed his desire. The lower part of his body already reacted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blushed and quickly went to the bathroom, happily taking a shower. Because I was so happy, I even hummed the song Elliott sang tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a shower, dried myself, and walked out. Before I reached the edge of the bed, Elliott's palm directly took me to the bed, and the two of us sank heavily into the mattress together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready to take action.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was pressed under him hard by him. He bit my lips like punishment, caressed my face, and asked me softly, "Did you miss me in the past half month?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling his passion, I smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately hugged my waist. The smell of shower gel on his body mixed with the faint smell of alcohol in his throat made me so excited.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You missed me, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My brain went blank.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you miss me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed eager to know the answer. As he asked, he kept kissing my earlobes and neck, making my body itch, and all the cells in my body became excited due to his teasing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't miss you," I said deliberately coquettishly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't tell the truth, I will punish you later..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing my words, he kissed my skin harder and tore the towel off me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, I had endured his perfunctory treatment, indifference, and ignorance, but I had never seem him to be so passion in front of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was cuter and talked more when he was drunk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept asking me about my love for him. This scene was something I had never imagined or dreamed of before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the past half month, whenever I close my eyes, I recalled that night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe you didn't miss me. You lied to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was your first time, right? I didn't expect that you had never been with anyone else for so many years just for waiting for me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me you missed me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott kissed me and murmured. And through his words, I realized that he had missed me so much in the past half month.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="285.html">« Prev</a><a href="287.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
