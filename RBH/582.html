Isn't it normal for us to stay together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? She's your fianc&eacute;e now? But she's carrying the child of our Bryant family. How could you two...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've misunderstood. The child she's carrying is mine, not related to your Bryant family," Quinn interjected directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you saying? That's impossible! She was still married to our Elliott before. How could she be with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's expression darkened as she heard the child wasn't from her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even when Elliott didn't get divorced, you still had Giselle get pregnant with his child, right? It's just common courtesy, it's only fair that way, isn't it?" Quinn retorted mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's expression changed instantly. Laura's friend struggled to contain her laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can it be the same? Madeline, you... you've done something morally reprehensible, getting pregnant by someone else while with our Elliott. You... you've gone too far!" Laura exclaimed angrily, reverting to her previous fierce demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sneered, looking at her disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn continued, "No matter how far Madeline has gone, it's nothing compared to your Bryant family. Calling Madeline a hen that won't lay eggs while scheming against her. Who really can't make a hen lay eggs, considering how she got pregnant so quickly after being with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you... how dare you insult my son? How can you call yourself a good buddy of Elliott?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura trembled with anger, pointing an accusing finger at Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Handling provocations like this was Quinn's forte. He continued to sneer, "It's because we're good buddies that I bravely stepped in. If the Bryant family doesn't cherish Madeline, I'll let you know she has someone else who values her. I advise you to do more good deeds. By the way, it's best to have Giselle undergo a comprehensive check-up before giving birth, just to ensure the child's health..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Quinn deliberately provoked with his words, he was actually reminding Laura to pay attention to Giselle's baby's health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, consumed by anger, Laura couldn't take it in. Upon hearing Quinn's curse on her precious grandson, she was left speechless, almost unable to catch her breath, before suddenly fainting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's fainting spell frightened her friend, who hurriedly called for help in the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yacht's crew quickly arrived and helped Laura to the medical room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get off the boat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn successfully caused Laura to faint, then flashed me a mischievous grin, signaling for us to leave together.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="581.html">« Prev</a><a href="583.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
