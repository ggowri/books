Quinn, you don't need to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could even speak, Elliott quickly rushed forward and angrily pulled me out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, wait! What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quickly shouted, however, it was already too late by the time he caught up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott dragged me out of the farmhouse. He opened the car door and shoved me into the passenger seat, then quickly sat in the driver's seat and started the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Quinn came out, Elliott had already started the car and sped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intentionally tried to shake off Quinn, so he deliberately drove the car at a high speed, which scared me pale, as if we were racing. As a result, I quickly grabbed the handle on the top of the car, and I felt like throwing up due to the jolting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After driving for a long distance, Elliott finally slowed down the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The music in the car was chilling. I sat in the passenger seat and was surprised to find that the dashboard in his car was actually the one I had bought before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at this scene, the past memories unconsciously flooded into my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was in a daze when I suddenly heard him scornfully say, "I never expected that you and Quinn were actually serious. It seems like you were joking when you wrote in your diary that you would love me only!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Elliott's cold voice, there was a strong sense of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And hearing him say that, I immediately understood. Elliott must have seen me with Quinn just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn kissed me with the grape skin on his mouth to tease me. But it may made us look like a couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had already said that the diary was nothing but a momentary fantasy of a young girl yearning for marriage. I was very childish. Why would you believe it, Mr. Bryant?" I mocked in the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought that after loving me for so many years, you would never be able to love someone else. It seems like I overestimated you!" Elliott said, feeling frustrated. He appeared to be suppressing his emotions, so he forcefully pulled at the collar of his shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard the sound of a button popping open and instinctively turned my head to glance at his extremely frustrated face. I was a bit satisfied seeing his frustrated look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Elliott really say something like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He actually minded that I fell in love with someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed disdainfully, "Love that doesn't change only exists in novels. Mr. Bryant used to look down on women like me who were constantly immersed in love. Why are you suddenly interested in devotion now? Didn't you think it was all illusory before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but mock him, especially when I thought about those first three years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott used to be very arrogant and put his work before everything else. He never cared about me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he looked down on me for being so devoted. He even despised me for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the arrogant Elliott, surprisingly, started talking to me about love. I was truly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was feeling emotional in my heart, however, my words probably hit his limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, who was driving, suddenly made a sharp turn and abruptly stopped the car by the roadside. Before I could react, he suddenly turned around and grabbed my face, staring at me with his intimidating eyes!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="632.html">« Prev</a><a href="634.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
