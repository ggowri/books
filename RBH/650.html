Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had become short-tempered. Whenever she saw Philip, she would lose control. She didn't even want to spend a minute with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige intended to hit him with a pillow, but as she swung, she accidentally hit someone who suddenly appeared at the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the person didn't move when the pillow was thrown over. He walked over from the darkness. When I took a closer look, it turned out to be Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect to see Elliott there. But went straight to the sofa and sat down without even looking at us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place we were in was the largest room in Quinn's clubhouse itself. This room was several thousand square feet in size, and was divided into several different areas. The area where we were located was the bar area. However, Elliott went straight to the central singing area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he sat down, a hot woman named Alyssa Davis walked towards him in a seductive way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was a handsome guy. Wherever he went, he was like the moon among the stars. No one could outshine him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Alyssa arrived, she didn't choose to sit on the couch but instead sat directly on Elliott's lap. Afterward, she began pouring wine for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott remained silent and did not want to push her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced subconsciously. That scene was embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I expressed my dissatisfaction, "Quinn, we have been using this room, can't we let them go to another room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn awkwardly chuckled, "Elliott is the top VIP in my club, and he has the privilege to use this room. If you're not happy about it, we can go to another room. </span><span>Shall we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I heard it, I shook my head and deliberately said loudly, "Why? We arrived first, we are all customers, so why should we give up our seats just because he arrived? I refuse, I want to stay here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I </span><span>would no longer make any concessions to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I said this, Fiona immediately agreed, "Yeah, let's just stay here. We understand that some people want to have fun. After all, there was such a big joke last night, it's normal that someone needs to release his anger. But I hope he won't go too far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Elliott was once Quinn's friend, so we said this in a way that made Quinn feel a bit awkward. He gestured to the waiter and whispered a few words in the waiter's ear, then the waiter nodded and quickly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip remained rooted to the spot. Despite being tall, he now felt as if he had shrunk in the presence of Paige. Philip bent his neck and lowered his head, appearing both guilty and at a loss for what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you still standing there? Go over there, Elliott is hooking up with women. Go join him. Show us your skill!" Paige rolled her eyes at Philip and sarcastically remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott is in a bad mood. I am just here to accompany him. Why would I hook up with other women? I will never do that again. Don't worry," Philip said meekly, while trying to get closer to Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he wanted to approach her, Paige immediately picked up the glass on the table and made a gesture as if she wanted to smash it at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip, stay there. You know you shouldn't provoke me! Stay away from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige is still angry, so don't provoke her. You should go and spend time with Elliott instead," Quinn quickly said upon seeing the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then you help me persuade Paige. I will go first."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="649.html">« Prev</a><a href="651.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
