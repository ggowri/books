Soon, he grabbed her arm and forcefully pressed her face against a tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let your people release them! Hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's magnetic voice resounded, his firm tone and extremely penetrating voice indicating that he was Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men who were holding me let go of me quickly, and I was once again thrown to the ground by them. At this moment, a surge of intense pain in my abdomen hit me, causing me to contort in agony. I couldn't bear the severe pain any longer, and I immediately passed out from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The labor pains grew stronger with each passing moment, and I was in extreme pain to the point where I couldn't see clearly what was in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a daze, I seemed to hear the roar of cars, as if a helicopter was hovering above my head. I felt like I was being lifted up from the ground by someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She was bleeding a lot! Hurry, find a way to save her! We must ensure that both she and the child are okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a daze, I heard the man holding me desperately shouting. I really wanted to open my eyes and see his face, but I was already in so much pain that I didn't even have the strength to open my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body was constantly bouncing like on a swing, and that man seemed to be holding me tightly as we ran desperately. Soon, I felt like I was placed in a car, and then, two strong beams of light above my head made it impossible for me to open my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, I fell into a deep coma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know how long I had been struggling, but when I opened my eyes again, I found myself facing not the desolate mountains and forests, but white walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pungent smell of disinfectant and the cold instruments around me made me realize that I was in a hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively moved my hand, only to find that there seemed to be a needle inserted on my finger. My body also seemed to be filled with instruments, and there was no one around me, only many instruments occasionally emitting piercing dripping sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know where I was, I only felt that my body and eyelids were very heavy. I wanted to wake myself up, but I couldn't wake up all the time. In the end, I fell into a coma again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I regained consciousness once again, I found myself in a clean and refreshing hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I opened my eyes, I felt someone tightly holding my hand. The warmth of his palm made me unable to resist moving my fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, I heard Quinn's gentle voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you finally woke up! That's great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up in his direction. Quinn was sitting on the edge of the bed, wearing a light blue shirt and black pants. His face looked haggard, with a beard covering it, and his eyes were bloodshot. It was evident that he hadn't had a proper rest for many days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the smile on his face at that moment indicated that he was truly happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, where was I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked softly, and I realized that my voice still sounded weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At Hoswich City People's Hospital, Madeline. Don't worry. You and the baby are both safe. The baby is now in an incubator, with good vital signs. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn tightly held my hand, knowing what I was most worried about, so he immediately said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoswich city People's Hospital?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was immediately confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did I get rescued?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They brought me back from Norch City to Hoswich City, and did I also successfully give birth to my baby?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="747.html">« Prev</a><a href="749.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
