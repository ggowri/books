He stood still, his hand trembling as he made the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this situation, Jezebel finally realized that she was malicious. She looked around in panic, trying to sneak away while we weren't paying attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn noticed her. He immediately let go of Paige, and without hesitation, he grabbed Jezebel's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carlton, she's pregnant. You knew that, right? But you still attacked her. Did you know that you have committed a crime? You have committed the crime of intentional homicide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was also furious. What Jezebel did was out of our expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel frowned. She was indeed a good actress. Tears welled up in her eyes all at once when she found that she couldn't slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Woods, I didn't intentionally hit her in the belly. I didn't realize the consequences. Please let me go, okay? I didn't mean to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel kept begging for mercy, but Quinn couldn't let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "Take your time to explain when the police come. The surveillance on this road has already recorded everything you did."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel's face turned pale. She tried to free herself from Quinn's grip, but she couldn't no matter how she tried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she shouted at Philip, "Philip, tell him to let me go. You said I was your girlfriend, but you didn't tell me you had a fianc&eacute;e. How could you deceive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel looked at Philip with pity. Seeing Paige in danger, Philip got panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished the call, he ran towards me and Paige. He grabbed Paige's arm. Seeing Paige glare at him fiercely, he didn't know what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was in so much pain that she couldn't speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Philip and Jezebel with hatred and disappointment in her eyes that I had never seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was terrified as I watched blood gushing out of her body, and I kept comforting her. However, she gritted her teeth and didn't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the ambulance and police car arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Paige was being lifted onto a stretcher, Jezebel was also taken away by the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip and I accompanied Paige to the hospital, while Quinn went with the police to give a statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ten minutes or so, the ambulance brought us to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Paige's face turned pale, and she stared blankly at the ceiling. She was indifferent as if the doctors and nurses' efforts to save her had nothing to do with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never seen Paige so calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remembered her for many years as being so sweet, lively, brave, and competent. She never let herself suffer any grievances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I felt she was completely a stranger to me. She might have been </span><span>about to lose her child, but she remained calm, incredibly calm, which scared me a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately called Fiona.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="603.html">« Prev</a><a href="605.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
