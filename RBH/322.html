In the end, I did nothing but watched him leave my house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door slammed shut behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't afford to dwell on it. Right now, the most important thing for me was to find Jade.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had crossed the line too many times, and it was time for me to settle the score with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a jarring ringtone echoed in my living room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't coming from my phone, so I frantically searched for the source and found a shattered phone under the sofa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was undoubtedly dropped by one of the thugs during Elliott's scuffle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The displayed number belonged to Jade.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pressed the answer button and at the same time, I pressed the record button.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I pressed the answer button, I also pushed the record button. Before I could say a word, Jade's frantic voice came through the phone. "What's going on? Did you succeed? Why haven't you reported any progress yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she had no idea about what had happened on my end and assumed that the thugs had succeeded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smirked coldly and spoke into the phone, "Jade, would you be surprised if I told you that the police have already arrested them?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade Obviously, he didn't expect that what came out of the phone was my voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade evidently didn't expect to hear my voice on the other end of the line. She remained silent for several seconds before realizing that the situation had been exposed and abruptly hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had she done at Glory Group had been thoroughly exposed, and her attempt to negotiate by kidnapping my mom had failed. Next, she would probably flee before the police could arrest her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, I dashed out of the house without further hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I intended to find Jade. But as I drove alone to her house, I suddenly realized how dangerous it was to confront her alone. After all, she's at the end of her rope now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who should I ask to accompany me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I thought of Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just been blaming me for not contacting him first whenever something happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I dialed his number.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time in a long while that I had dialed his number myself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to my surprise, he didn't answer the call.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange sense of disappointment filled my heart...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always blamed me for not reaching out to him first whenever something happened. But every time I tried to contact him, it seemed to end up like this; either he rejected the call or no one answered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that I didn't want to rely on or seek his help, but he had never given me the confidence to depend on him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dialed Quinn's number directly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Elliott, Quinn was always ready to help. I briefly explained the situation over the phone, and he promptly agreed to come over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time was of the essence, and we wasted no time in driving straight to Jade's villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, when we arrived, the villa was brightly lit, with a large truck parked outside, and several people were moving in and out, carrying things.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, we understood that Jade had realized something was wrong and was planning to escape.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just the two of us won't be able to stop her. We need to notify the police to arrest her," Quinn said as soon as he saw the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, there's concrete evidence of her embezzlement of company funds. The thugs tonight were also sent by her. We can't let her get away like this!" I nodded, then immediately dialed the police to inform them to come over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Jade hurriedly emerged from the villa, carrying a backpack and dragging a suitcase behind her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="321.html">« Prev</a><a href="323.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
