I immediately cooperated, closing my eyes and wrapping my arms around his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's kiss was both domineering and gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started by lightly licking, then slowly sucking on my lips, transitioning to my tongue, gradually deepening the kiss until he claimed my entire mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pinned against the wall, I could only see his features, while the sounds of the wind and passersby's gasps filled my ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've never been kissed so boldly on the street before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be precise, Elliott was the only person she had ever kissed, and that experience was a first for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His teasing left me weak, and my body feeling like it was melting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized then just how skilled Elliott was at kissing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few minutes of passionate kissing, combined with the foreign atmosphere, was enough to make me feel euphoric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held me and kissed me for a long time, and we both became lost in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was completely dazed until he suddenly slipped his hand under my shirt, snapping me back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My rationality returned in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly grabbed his hand and pulled away from his almost bruising kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced around but didn't see those people anywhere. It was late, and the streets were nearly empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you lied! There's no one chasing us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing I'd been tricked, I angrily pounded his chest and hissed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was still catching his breath, his eyes filled with desire, deep and hazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even knowing I was mad, he chuckled and playfully bit my exposed shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden tingling made me gasp, my body instinctively tensing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't lie. They just left. We changed clothes; they wouldn't recognize us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's lips brushed my neck, his voice husky and magnetic, dripping with intimacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up at him, half-believing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe from all the running, my body was exhausted, my waist aching and weak, barely able to stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was my first intense exercise since giving birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not lying. We're safe. Where are you staying? I'll take you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott reluctantly let go of me. His deep, sexy voice and familiar cologne made my heart flutter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened my mouth, trying to shake off the strange feelings:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I stay at..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was about to say the hotel's name but suddenly drew a blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively searched my pockets for my phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then I realized I hadn't brought my phone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had only gone to the restroom, leaving my phone and bag on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's question left me stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Already bad with directions, without my phone, I had no idea where I was staying or where I was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this was Korea, not a familiar place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold sweat broke out on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott noticed my distress and gently held my shoulders, asking softly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Lost your phone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I left my phone at the bar. I can't remember the hotel's name. Paige arranged everything; I didn't pay attention. Now I'm stuck..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I started to panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my anxiety, Elliott took my hand, gently soothing my back, and said softly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. Even if you can't remember, I'm here. I won't let you sleep on the street. Those people might come back. Let's get a cab and leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't resist. Being in a foreign country, following Elliott felt safer than wandering alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott held my hand as we walked, but soon I felt a sharp pain in my heel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The running had worn my heel raw. I hadn't noticed before, but now it hurt a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but let out a small cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sensed something was wrong. He turned and saw my pained expression, quickly looking at my foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately knelt down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring his usual cleanliness, he took off my shoe and carefully examined my heel, his raspy voice saying:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't walk anymore. Your heel is raw. I'll carry you. Get on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he crouched in front of me, ready to give me a piggyback ride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback by his thoughtfulness and felt a bit embarrassed, but he had already grabbed my legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring whether I agreed or not, he hoisted me onto his shoulders and strode towards the main road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I bounced slightly on his back, my initial panic gradually turned into calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up at the moonlit sky, then down at his dark hair and slender neck. Realizing I was on his back, a wave of happiness unexpectedly washed over me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was a commotion behind us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on tight, they're coming! I need to run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, I quickly wrapped my arms around his neck. Soon, my whole body was airborne, moving swiftly with his strides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never knew Elliott had such stamina. Even with me on his back, he ran with incredible agility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swiftly carried me through the alley and finally reached the brightly lit main road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A taxi approached, and he quickly flagged it down. He then shoved me inside, jumped in after me, and shut the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, the group chasing us appeared, looking fierce and ready to grab us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart pounded in my throat...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="920.html">« Prev</a><a href="922.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
