Without hesitation, I headed straight for the car and quickly climbed in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arrived home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I pushed open the door and dropped my luggage, I immediately dashed towards the nursery, my heart pounding with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had barely made it to the second floor when Lily rushed in. She held a bottle of alcohol disinfectant spray in her hand, swiftly misting it all over me from head to toe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what are you up to?" I asked, furrowing my brows.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's all sorts of flu going around out there. How can I let you near my little one without disinfecting you first?" Lily said, her brows furrowed in concern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to dote on me so much, but now, with Noah around, she barely pays me any attention. Her heart and mind are all for Noah now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is your darling now Noah, not me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, you've got to see this, Noah has grown so much these past few days. His little face is all chubby and absolutely adorable. Your dad and I wish we could stay awake 24/7, just to watch him. He's just too cute."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Lily mentioned Noah, she instantly became animated, words pouring out of her in a torrent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She yanked my hand, immediately leading me into the nursery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my haste, I was about to rush over to see Noah, but to my surprise, I found Quinn and Austin standing by the crib, playfully entertaining the little baby inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah, do you like the little sand hammer Daddy bought for you? Blink if you do."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah, give daddy a smile. If you do, I'll buy you anything you want in the future&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was facing away from me, amusing Noah with laughter, while Austin stood nearby, chuckling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's so-called "dad" had me taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he's fully embraced his role as Noah's dad, otherwise, he wouldn't speak so naturally.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here I am, forced to stick by Elliott's side, feeling a pang of guilt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn has been coming over almost every day lately. Each time, he either brings toys for Noah or something for us. He really adores Noah. A couple of days ago, when the nanny was off and your dad and I were too nervous to bathe Noah, it was Quinn who stepped in. He was incredibly attentive."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily leaned in close, whispering softly into my ear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her say that, I was deeply moved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I'm back. Is Noah awake?" I approached with a smile, asking casually.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline!" Quinn turned, a look of surprise and delight on his face. "The little guy just woke up a bit ago. You two really do have a knack for timing. He's been sleeping all this while, and the moment you return, he wakes up. Come, give him a cuddle."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed as though Noah truly knew I was back, as he suddenly burst into tears.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="836.html">« Prev</a><a href="838.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
