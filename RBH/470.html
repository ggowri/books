She glanced at Elliott lying on the bed, then her gaze turned sharp as she looked at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were filled with intense vigilance and disdain, which hurt me deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what are you doing here again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had finally settled into a peaceful sleep, but Laura's loud voice clearly disturbed him. I could feel his hand, gripping mine, tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Laura hadn't suddenly appeared here, perhaps I could have stayed a little longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing her, I just wanted to leave quickly. So I immediately let go of Elliott's hand and took two steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, take care of him. I'm leaving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing as Elliott was running a fever, I didn't want to argue with Laura in the room. So I ignored her directly and instructed Barry before turning and walking out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, I heard Elliott's weak call from behind. Then came a loud thud, as if something heavy had fallen to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned around and saw Elliott, who had been lying down, now on the floor. He reached out his arm, looking helpless and pleadingly at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry hurried over to help him up from the ground. Seeing him, and then looking at Laura's face, I made a firm decision and left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hallway, I unexpectedly ran into another person I didn't want to see at all, Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing a dark green fur coat, paired with a black skirt, proudly displaying her pregnant belly. When she saw me, her eyes were filled with malice and calculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her reaction was identical to Laura's, her tone full of triumph, as if she had already become Elliott's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I paused for a moment, gave her a cold glance, and felt no desire to talk to her in the murky air. After giving her a scornful look, I quickly walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you better stop daydreaming. It's best for everyone if you and Elliott go through with the divorce. This is for the good of everyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle shouted loudly behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This bitch clearly hadn't learned her lesson yet. She's still acting so arrogantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How dare she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but sneer, ignoring her and quickly walking out of the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the late hour, Bryant Hospital remained bustling with activity. Perhaps the recent sharp decline in temperature was to blame, as the emergency department was still bustling with patients seeking medical attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are so many people with high fevers recently. It's really overwhelming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I wonder what's going on recently? Why are there suddenly so many people with fevers?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fever clinic is so busy now. As a result, we have to work overtime together. It's really annoying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As two nurses hurried past me, I heard their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze for a moment. In that instant, I recalled that in my previous life, there was a sudden outbreak of new flu around this time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering Barry's words that Elliott's fever had persisted for two days without improvement, could it be that he has now contracted the virus?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That new strain of influenza was incredibly aggressive, spreading rapidly across the nation during a single Christmas holiday, infecting tens of thousands. In cases where timely and effective treatment was unavailable, the risk of death loomed high if complications developed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a chill down my spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately went back to the car, took out my phone, found Marcus' number, and dialed his number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, are you busy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just got home. What's up, Madeline? Do you need something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' tone was somewhat surprised and puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have an urgent matter to discuss with you. Marcus, can I come over to your place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly asked.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="469.html">« Prev</a><a href="471.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
