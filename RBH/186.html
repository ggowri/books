He opened the drawer again, wanting to take out that notebook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly went to close the drawer. "There's really nothing interesting, and besides, this belongs to my personal privacy, Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really no longer wanted him to see even a trace in the diary, but what surprised me was that Elliott became interested in this diary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled the drawer open with force and quickly took out the diary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I had read this notebook some time ago, I didn't lock it. He quickly opened it and looked at it after he got the notebook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like my most hidden thoughts being discovered by someone, an indescribable anger instantly surged within me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly reached out to grab it, but as a 5.6ft person, I had no advantage in height compared to Elliott, who was 6ft tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised the diary high, quickly scanning the words and sentences inside. I desperately tiptoed, wanting to grab it while shouting, "Elliott, give it back to me! This is my privacy, don't you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's your privacy, but those are my photos and my name. Can't I, as your husband, know about your past?" Elliott remained domineering, and with the influence of alcohol, he insisted on browsing through my diary, no matter how much I fought for it, he refused to give it to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at those secrets and inner thoughts that I wrote with so much pain in the past, now being laid bare by Elliott, I didn't feel any joy. On the contrary, I felt a sense of humiliation, as if my clothes had been stripped off and I was being shamelessly observed and violated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough, Elliott! Give it back to me!" The inexplicable anger filled my chest, and I shouted loudly, my voice already icy to the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never expected that you had liked me so early on," Elliott said, but he was already engrossed in the contents of the diary. Clearly, my words in the diary had surprised him to the point where he couldn't help but exclaim in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing his lament, I was overwhelmed by a sense of humiliation that I couldn't fathom. I jumped up forcefully and snatched the diary from his hands, then proceeded to tear it in half with all my might!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough, Elliott. The diary only represents my immature past, not what I still think now! You have nothing to be proud of!" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I no longer wanted him to know how much I used to like him in the past, and I definitely didn't want him to use it as leverage to manipulate my present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried desperately to tear up the diary, but back then, because I loved him, even the diary I wrote for him was made of leather paper. Even though I tried my best to tear it apart, the diary was not cooperative and only ended up being creased by me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words clearly stunned Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how desperately I wanted to tear up the diary, he quickly wrapped his hands around my shoulders, snatched the diary from my hands, and threw it onto the nearby table. He softly said, "Madeline, it's okay, I won't look at it. Don't be so impulsive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was deep and it lingered by my ear, the gentleness in his tone made my body tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to push him away, but he just wouldn't let go of me. The gas he exhaled made my ears slightly itchy, and it carried a faint scent of wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being held like this by him, I felt like a precious gem embedded in his broad chest. It was something I had longed for in my dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, I didn't feel the slightest tremor, because I knew better than anyone that he would inevitably fall in love with someone else in the near future, and I, I was just an insignificant passerby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I felt a bit dizzy, can you accompany me to take a nap on your bed?" Elliott said gently in my ear as my emotions gradually calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body subconsciously leaned towards me, clearly showing signs of physical exhaustion.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="185.html">« Prev</a><a href="187.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
