You woke me up so early. I'm half asleep." I grabbed the phone, still groggy from sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents would like to meet you and have invited you over to our villa for lunch. I'll pick you up." Quinn's direct statement hit me like a bombshell, instantly clearing my mind and jolting me out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you talking about? Y-Your parents want to meet me? For what? Are they going to negotiate with me? Quinn, don't mess around!" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine. It's not as scary as you think. My parents knew about it and wanted to meet you." Quinn's tone was extraordinarily gentle compared to my agitated tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we are obviously not a couple. There's no need for me to meet your parents," I said to the phone after calming down a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be too nervous. Take it as a normal dinner and a visit to a friend. My parents are very nice. Don't worry. They won't give you a hard time," Quinn said with a smile on the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he made it simple, I still felt something strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;It all happened so fast that I was not even mentally prepared for it.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's better to put it off. Tell your parents that I've been tied up with things lately. Once being free, I'll treat them to dinner, okay?" After a moment's reflection, I still did not think it very proper, and politely declined.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But my parents went shopping early this morning, and the kitchen is bustling with activity now. If you don't come, how am I going to explain it to them?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Quinn mentioned that his parents had already started preparing the lunch. At that moment, I was compelled to say yes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's really inappropriate. We are well aware of what's going on between us, aren't we?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was all of a sudden torn up inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said it was okay. Madeline, you don't have to be psychologically pressured. I'll arrange everything. Rest assured. I'll never let you suffer any embarrassment," Quinn reassured again and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Quinn's words and reminding myself of how good he had always been to me, I could only steel myself to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I hung up, my drowsiness dissipated, prompting me to rise from bed and meticulously choose an outfit from my closet. After much deliberation, I settled on a white satin dress paired with a fox-collar tweed jacket, complemented by flat-pointed shoes and flesh-toned stockings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adorned in this manner, I stood in front of the mirror, quietly scrutinizing my reflection. Then, I curled my hair with a curling iron, put on light makeup, and wore some relatively simple jewelry before walking downstairs with my bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Observing my choice of attire for the day, which leaned towards elegance rather than smart wear, Lily inquired, "Madeline, what's the occasion for dressing up like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I won't have lunch at home but will meet a friend," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid worrying Lily, I opted not to disclose the truth and instead told a white lie before swiftly departing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn came quickly. By the time I walked out the door, his car was already waiting quietly at the curb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was likely his first time seeing me dressed so elegantly. From a distance, he immediately got out of the car, approached me, and sized me up before smiling, "Hey, today, your outfit is quite formal. You put in some effort."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Considering it's lunch with your parents, I can't afford to look sloppy. But Quinn, I'm really kind of overwhelmed," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;It was all so sudden that I was still a little apprehensive.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. Trust me. My parents are known to be good-natured." Quinn reached over and took me by the shoulders. Without further ado, he opened the car door and gentlemanly let me sit in the car.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="535.html">« Prev</a><a href="537.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
