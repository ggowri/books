Just as his car was about to reach a fork in the road, a truck suddenly hit him. The front of his car shifted, and then the entire car hit a railing on one side. The front half of the car was dented.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad hit his head on the glass and bled a lot. His life was still dangerous. The truck driver who caused the accident quickly left. By the time the police found the car, the driver had already abandoned the car and ran away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing these situations, my mood suddenly became as anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying a word, I immediately drove my car as fast as I could to Hoswich. When Paige learned about the situation, he also set off with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, I called Quinn and Fiona. Fortunately, Quinn was already in Hoswich, so I asked him to help me pick up Lily to the hospital first. Because Lily had high blood pressure, I told Quinn must pay attention to Lily's emotions and shouldn't let her get too excited.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Fiona also said that she would first help me take care of all Austin's affairs in the hospital. She told me to drive slowly and not to be in a hurry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, Austin suddenly had such an accident, I couldn't calm down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was very panicked and rushed to Hoswich. After that, I rushed to the hospital as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I arrived at the hospital, Austin was still in the emergency room. As soon as I walked into the corridor, I heard Lily's cry coming from the rescue room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I yelled and ran towards her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you are finally back, the doctor said, your dad..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother was so sad that she threw herself into my arms when she saw me. She was so sad that she couldn't speak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and Fiona waited outside the emergency room with my mother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn told me, "Your dad is still being rescued. Fiona looked for the best doctor in the hospital for your dad. Your dad will be fine! "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't worry. My dad will be fine!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly comforted her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Lily stop crying. She nodded and looked at the emergency room with worry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, your dad must be fine. If something happens to him, how can I survive? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily and Austin have been deeply in love for so many years. My dad had always been in good health, and this was the first time that Lily and I were so worried.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held Lily's hand tightly and looked solemnly at the door of the emergency room, waiting anxiously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona brought us several bottles of drinkable glucose water.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said calmly, "Don't worry. I just went in and took a look. Although your father has injured his brain and ribs, fortunately, there are no serious injuries to his internal organs. The bleeding has stopped now, and your father should be able to come out soon."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good, he will be fine! That damn truck driver! With such a wide road, how come he did not see your father's car?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Lily thought of this, she patted her chest again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So I had to comfort her for a while. Just as she slowly calmed down, my cousin and uncle hurried over from the other end of the corridor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, Madeline, how is Austin?
