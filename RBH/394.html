She dashed over to him, all sweetness and light.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced up to see Elliott standing at the door, his face cool and collected as always.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing him didn't exactly warm my heart, it actually made my stomach churn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked around the room, a bit surprised, before his eyes landed on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made his way over and, right in front of everyone, reached out to give my shoulder a supportive squeeze, concern written all over his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You okay? Sorry I'm late," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his words didn't do much for me. They just fueled my sarcasm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shrugged off his hand and shot back, "Well, you're not too late to witness your people causing chaos here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head, locking eyes with him with a cold stare.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His once-familiar face now seemed strangely unfamiliar to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My gut told me there was more to his connection with Giselle than met the eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That feeling gave me the courage to guard my heart and steer clear of any romantic illusions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wouldn't be dumb enough to put everything on the line for love, especially not with Elliott. It was time to be smart and focus on the future of the Glory Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No more foolish mistakes for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott noticed my lack of reaction and seemed like he wanted to say something, but he turned to Giselle instead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle put on a whole show, rubbing her belly like she was trying to remind Elliott of their supposed baby.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave him this pleading look, biting her lip and saying with a fake tearful voice, "Elliott, please... don't be mad at me. I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I just came to visit Madeline's dad, but her mom freaked out when she saw me. It's all just a big misunderstanding, I swear."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like she did a complete 180 from her earlier proud self, now playing the innocent card.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but shake my head and chuckle. "Giselle, nice try, but let's not forget about the camera. Maybe it's time for a little reality check, huh? Let's see the CCTV footage and give Elliott the full picture."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I dropped that bomb, Giselle went pale as a ghost. Her eyes darted around nervously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was clearly caught off guard by the mention of CCTV camera.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott caught on fast. He took out his phone and called up the director of Bryant Hospital, demanding they send over the footage from our room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The director wasted no time, and in a flash, the footage was in Elliott's hands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott quickly played the video for everyone to see. And when he witnessed Giselle's earlier behavior, his expression darkened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could tell he was finally seeing Giselle's true colors.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="393.html">« Prev</a><a href="395.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
