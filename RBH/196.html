It shouldn't be possible, right?" It took several seconds before I murmured into the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Have you softened up?" Quinn heard my voice and asked on the other end of the phone with a half-smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soft-hearted?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was not a matter of being soft-hearted, but rather feeling incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, Elliott, who used to be as majestic as a god in my eyes, now rarely loses control of his emotions and even gets drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I always felt like I was dreaming, with a strong sense of unreality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, then please take him back," I thought for a moment and said into the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think about the harm he once caused you, and you will realize that the little lesson he learned is nothing. Madeline, women should never be too soft-hearted, because being too soft makes it easy to be manipulated," Quinn said on the other end of the phone, and before I could hang up, he had already ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat on the terrace, staring blankly at the cold moonlight around me. Quinn's words still lingered in my ears. I thought to myself, "Yes, no matter what, I must not soften my heart. I cannot forget the piercing pain I once felt just because Elliott has been a little kind to me. Absolutely not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I returned to the room, and shortly after, Quinn also sent me a text message, telling me that they had safely taken Elliott home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I expressed my gratitude to Quinn and then quickly fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The film and television projects in Louis City are currently in full swing, and cost control is crucial. After all, Everyone knows that producing a TV series burns through money. Behind any scene, there may be huge expenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the first thing I did after arriving in Louis City was to settle the expenses I had incurred so far, to see which expenses were more reasonable and which expenses could be controlled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I also watched many pre-shot clips to understand the filming progress and acting skills of these actors, and to check if the early promotion of the entire play was done properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I arrived in Louis City, I became busy every day, and as I got busy, time passed by quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone who hadn't really worked much before, the people and events that happened in the theater every day gave me a fresh sense of glimpsing into another world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Instagram updates have become much more frequent than before. From time to time, I share some behind-the-scenes moments and daily life on Instagram. It is also inevitable that I will post a lot of group photos with the cast members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is probably because I am naturally down-to-earth that the actors in the theater all like me, especially a group of male actors. When they are not busy, they always like to gather around me and tell me some funny jokes, making me burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also noticed Audrey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was truly an exceptionally serious and focused little girl. In the restless entertainment industry, she was so young, yet rarely had such a high level of concentration on acting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from doing makeup and shooting every day, she devoted her thoughts to pondering lines and acting. Sometimes, she would also seek advice and communicate with some veteran actors in the crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I especially liked the way she acted, her eyes were very spirited and had a radiant feeling. As soon as she entered the acting state, the halo of the female lead immediately appeared on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her amazing performance, I became even more convinced that the movie "Do Not Love" could definitely become a hit in today's market. Her acting skills were far more explosive than Sylvia's performance as the female lead in the previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she saw me, she just smiled sweetly and greeted me. Apart from that, we didn't have much interaction, and I didn't intend to disturb her either. I just let Adam talk to her about the signing matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to sign her to Glory Group while she still lacked market influence, so that in the future, this rising star can definitely bring more profits to Glory Group.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="195.html">« Prev</a><a href="197.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
