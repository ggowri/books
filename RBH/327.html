He almost gave everything for her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear that, Quinn?" I murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange mix of jealousy and resentment made me pick up the glass in front of me and down the entire beer in one go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe she's just showing off in her little circle. Her words may not be trustworthy. Don't overthink it," Quinn reassured me, sensing my extreme displeasure from my drinking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know what Elliott's current relationship with her is. But if he's willing to take a photo with her, it definitely means they have an unusual connection."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My spirits plummeted again. I poured myself another drink, gulping down several sips in quick succession.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A photo doesn't mean much. She probably insisted on it, and Elliott couldn't refuse. You know, she's the daughter of the man who saved Elliott's father's life. To him, Giselle is like a half-sister."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's defense of Elliott unknowingly added to my irritation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You always take your good buddy's side. How many scandals and women has he had around him these past few years? You know better than me," I retorted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those were just flings. At that time, he didn't care about you, you know that. Now, isn't he different towards you compared to before?" Quinn tried to console me in a helpless tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The music in the bar conveniently masked our conversation, coupled with the noise from their table, so Giselle still hadn't noticed me sitting at the adjacent table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to argue with Quinn, their table erupted into commotion once again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, we rarely get together like this, why are you only drinking soft drinks and not alcohol? No way, you must drink!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's the weekend tomorrow, you don't have work anyway. Let's party all night, drink till we drop!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, let me fill your glass with wine!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men and women started coaxing Giselle to drink alcohol.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought it was just Giselle pretending to be coy. However, at that moment, I heard a sentence from Giselle that hit like a bombshell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't joke around. It's not that I don't want to drink, I just can't drink right now. I... I think I might be pregnant."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words left my mind blank in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I incredulously glanced in Giselle's direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, too, seemed shocked. He instinctively turned to look at Giselle, then at me, and whispered, "Could she be pregnant with Elliott's child? That's impossible. Elliott can't be that kind of person..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="326.html">« Prev</a><a href="328.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
