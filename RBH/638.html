The Bryant family, this time, spent a huge amount of money and directly contracted the most luxurious Hoswich International Hotel. Moreover, they booked 188 tables according to the highest dining standards of the hotel to celebrate the birth of their child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on the information I have gathered, the Bryant family spent nearly tens of millions of dollars to organize this banquet. It seemed that they were foolishly rich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the eve of the banquet, I had already completed all the preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Woods family was the major shareholder behind Hoswich International Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Quinn's help, I managed to sneak into the IT room with Ken and found the backstage system of the banquet hall where the Bryant family was located.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken was not only a senior entertainment journalist, but also had top-notch computer skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he heard that I was going to do this, he agreed to help me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We waited quietly in the IT room for the start of the banquet. And through the surveillance screens in the room, we could see everything that happened in the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At six o'clock in the evening, the Bryant family's banquet officially began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I saw that Elliott and Giselle had already left the reception area and entered the main venue, I greeted Ken and Caleb Roberts and then walked out of the IT room, intending to enter the venue to watch this great show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was Elliott's ex-wife. The Bryant family naturally did not want me to appear, so it was impossible for them to invite me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I managed to obtain the invitation letter they gave to others, and with that invitation letter, I smoothly entered the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet hall was the largest one in Hoswich International Hotel. And with 188 tables, it was indeed grand, filling the entire banquet hall with people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So many people gathered together, the Bryant family naturally couldn't possibly notice my existence. Moreover, in order to avoid attracting attention, I deliberately chose an inconspicuous white dress and even wore a mask. I sat down at a loosely set table on the edge of the banquet hall, quietly observing everything happening and keeping my gaze locked on those two people whom I was extremely familiar with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they were standing at the most prominent position in the banquet hall, </span><span>exchanging greetings with the important guests they had invited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was dressed in a silver haute couture suit, with his hair meticulously styled into a sleek pompadour. Standing in the crowd, he still stood out, shining brightly and standing out from the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like this, always appearing in front of people as a tireless and impressive figure, and this was once what I loved to see the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost no woman does not admire strength, and I am no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as I looked at him again, I didn't feel the same instant attraction as before. On the contrary, I felt no excitement at all. Instead, when I thought about the upcoming play that will be released soon, I couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I hope that when you receive my grand gift later, you will still maintain your current carefree and noble demeanor," I thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and the heavyweight guests exchanged greetings, while Giselle stood quietly by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the distance, I still noticed at first glance that the silver dress on Giselle was a limited edition haute couture dress from a famous French brand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dress was exquisite and elegant, with a strong sense of design. The excellent tailoring perfectly concealed the excess fat on Giselle's body, and the deep V design highlighted her excellent figure... Although I looked down on this woman in my heart, I had to admit that she looked good in that dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's expensive gown and exquisite makeup were a clear sign that she had reached the pinnacle of life.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="637.html">« Prev</a><a href="639.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
