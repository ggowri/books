Who saved me? Quinn, was it you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I arrived, you had already been saved by Mr. Rethe. It was very dangerous at the time, and they managed to bring you out of the border with just 0.3 miles to spare. Mr. Rethe could have arrived earlier, but just as they were about to leave to rescue you, they received an urgent mission, so they were delayed. Fortunately, both you and Jane were very strong, and they successfully rescued you from those people and managed to control them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quickly explained the whole story, and his words instantly completely dispelled my doubts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that the person who appeared at that time was not Elliott, and the reason why I mistook him for Elliott was that I had a hallucination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was wondering why Dehan didn't show up earlier, but it turns out he had an urgent task, so it delayed him for some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, we eventually returned safely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, what happened? Why couldn't I reach you on the phone? And who was that person wearing your watch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was extremely surprised to see Quinn sitting in front of me safe and sound. Ignoring my physical weakness, I asked a series of questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was originally planning to go to Norch City, but as soon as I got off the plane, someone contacted me and told me that you asked him to pick me up. At that time, I didn't think much and just got in the car. Little did I know, after getting in the car, they knocked me out and took away all my belongings, including my phone and watch. They originally intended to kidnap me, but luckily when my friend came to pick me up, he couldn't reach me and found out through surveillance footage that I got into a stranger's car, so he immediately called the police. After being rescued by the police, I immediately contacted you, but by then, you had already been deceived and taken to Ruini. You can't imagine how anxious I was when I heard that you went to such a place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn held my hand and explained everything to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Jade had planned all of this in advance. She really wanted to kidnap Quinn. If it weren't for Quinn having friends in Norch City, it would have been difficult for Quinn to escape them this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but recall a series of encounters that day, and just thinking about the scene at that time still scares me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said that at the time of my rescue, the location was only 0.3 miles away from Mexico. If it wasn't for the man on the motorcycle appearing first, perhaps by the time Dehan arrived, they would have already dragged me into the territory of Myanmar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, was that man really not Elliott? Why did he look so much like him in my memory?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, was Dehan the only person who saved me at that time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, I asked again, filled with doubt.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="748.html">« Prev</a><a href="750.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
