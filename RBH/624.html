We are good friends, how could I betray you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken never told me about this. I didn't expect Giselle to have done something like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Ken, thank you. Do you have any dirt on her?" I asked hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were in a hidden room, but Ken still looked around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, he lowered his voice and said, "This woman is not innocent. A few months ago, she and Jezebel brought several male prostitutes to a hotel... You should understand what happened next, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Is it true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at him in astonishment...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle... Male prostitutes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't remember such a thing. Giselle looked very innocent. Could she be such a woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. We tracked down that hotel to film Jezebel. We captured Giselle, Jezebel, and six male prostitutes having a party. You were lucky you didn't see that chaotic scene. I hope I don't have to see it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Ken shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Ken's words, I became excited and immediately said to Ken, "Are you saying that you guys captured them? Do you still have that video? Give me the video. No matter what's the cost, I want to buy it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you want information about this woman? She isn't a celebrity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She isn't a celebrity, but she is my husband's lover. Ken, sell me the video, I need it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did not hide anything and told Ken the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken didn't expect that the relationship between Giselle and me was like this. Upon hearing my words, he stood up in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? Did this woman ruin your marriage? You and I are good friends, how can I sell the video to you? I will immediately have my subordinate organize the video and send it to your email."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to my words, Ken decided to send the video to me without charging. He made a phone call and told his subordinate to send the video to my email.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning home, I immediately turned on the computer and downloaded the file sent to my email.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had prepared myself before I clicked on that video. However, the video still shocked me, and I couldn't even look straight at the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle and Jezebel didn't expect someone to secretly film them as they were having a wild party with six male models at a resort hotel, wearing swimsuits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was chaotic. Giselle and Jezebel were surrounded by those men, tossing their heads wildly to the music. They seemed to have lost their sanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they hadn't drunk alcohol, it wouldn't have been possible for them to do such things. There were more and more explicit scenes in the video. Giselle and Jezebel were going crazy. They didn't seem like they had just drunk alcohol, but rather like they had taken some drugs.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="623.html">« Prev</a><a href="625.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
