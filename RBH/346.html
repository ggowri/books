What do you mean?" It was obvious that Elliott was confused by my question. He looked at me with a confused face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no intention of testing him. So, I showed him the message Adam had sent to me and also showed him Allure's pictures. "Shouldn't you explain this to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took my phone and had a look. Then his face immediately showed a look of enlightenment and looked at me with a half-smile,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you are angry about this matter." His tone was light and airy as if this matter was just an insignificant one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I didn't think so.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went to Louis City to find me several times. He should know that I had spent so much time and effort on Do Not Love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as my husband, he kept saying that he cared about me. But in the end, he deliberately made a plan and shot Allure secretly. He even took the opportunity to compete with my project at this time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People who cared about me wouldn't do this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more I thought about it, the angrier I felt. Originally, I had a lot to say. However, his indifferent tone and nonchalant eyes made it useless for me to talk with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that you don't care about this. Okay, just let it pass. I don't want to say it anymore!" I turned my head and looked directly out the window, but the emotions in my heart were still brewing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was driving, he tried to hold my hand. His tone was still light. "You were the one who stole my project back then. Didn't you say that such things always happen in business? Why are you angry with me now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he still remembered this matter. I did use some means to snatch the copyright of Do Not Love from him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to think Elliott was very generous. But I didn't expect that he would haggle over with me in this thing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, that's why you chose to lie to me." I shook his hand away and was more upset.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just want to see who has a better investment vision between you and me. Are you afraid now?" I didn't expect that at this juncture he would choose to make fun of me rather than comfort me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you afraid of? Elliott, if you insist on competing with me, I might as well tell you that my Do Not Love would never lose to your Allure! " The competitive spirit in my mind was suddenly aroused by him. I couldn't help but shout at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, compared with my excitement and mania, he was very calm. He looked at me with a half-smile. "So confident? How about making a bet?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bet for what?" I asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the rating of my Allure is higher than your Do Not Love, I will punish you for not divorcing me for the rest of your life," he turned to look at my eyes and said slyly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the rating of my Do Not Love is higher than your Allure, you have to promise that as long as I propose divorce, you must agree unconditionally. Deal or not? " I subconsciously blurted out this sentence when our eyes met with each other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's excited expression changed in an instant. "Are you still thinking about divorce?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This idea popped into my mind subconsciously. But it was too late for me to withdraw what I had said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So I explained, "Of course, I won't mention it easily. If I did propose divorce, it must be your wrong."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that the punishment I have given you recently is not enough, and I have to intensify it." Elliott suddenly braked and stopped the car on the side of the road.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="345.html">« Prev</a><a href="347.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
