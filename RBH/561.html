It didn't look big, and the decoration was retro. It was simply called "Stew Food".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought it was just a normal store, but when I walked in, I realized that it was special inside. Not only was this store large in area, but it also had a courtyard and was decorated in an elegant and retro style. Each private room was independent and private.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know this place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked after looking around in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know the places that offer tasty food and can have fun. I don't have any career aspirations but like to study all kinds of local customs and practices. If you like, I can take you to more interesting places in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn blinked, took me into one of the rooms, and sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a regular here. When the waiter saw him, she immediately came up to greet him warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Woods, what do you want to try today? The weather has been cold recently, so our store has launched a new tonic soup. It can enhance immunity. Isn't the flu prevalent recently? This soup is the most suitable..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I want this. Also, can you see if there's anything suitable for pregnant women?" Quinn asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will suggest this soup for your wife. This is made from eight kinds of ingredients that nourish the body. It is very nutritious. It can strengthen the body and allow the fetus to develop strongly. I think your wife is probably in the first trimester of pregnancy, so this soup is perfect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter introduced it enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She misunderstood that I was Quinn's wife, so I hurriedly explained, "I'm sorry, I'm not..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn interrupted me, nodded to the waiter, and said with a smile, "Okay, your suggestion just now is very good, then give my wife this one. In addition, prepare a salad for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"OK, just a second."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the waiter exited the room, I rolled my eyes at Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not your wife. You know the relationship between us best. Don't talk nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled and pinched my nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since we are going to pretend to be a couple, we have to act, otherwise our secret will be exposed, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." I shook my head dumbfounded and said, "I don't know what you want. There are so many women in this world. You don't pursue them but get involved with a married woman like me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished speaking, I smiled to myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Quinn would suddenly look at me seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I don't allow you to say that about yourself. You deserve all the good things in this world. Only those who know you understand how precious you are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words moved me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my head and looked at him blankly. The feeling of being understood and recognized made me burst into tears.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="560.html">« Prev</a><a href="562.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
