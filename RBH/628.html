They all appeared to be good friends, but actually, many relationships within the noblewomen's circle were very fragile and could not withstand any tests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than offering blessings, those so-called close friends tended to enjoy secretly mocking others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, this child looks... Why is his mouth so big and sticking out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, single eyelid, the eyes are also a bit strange, and the distance between them is wide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure about the photo? Is this really Mrs. Bryant's grandson? No matter how I look at it, he doesn't resemble her son much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gathered around my phone, watching and discussing it excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and said nothing, just showing the photo of the child without saying much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Laura heard the comments from the crowd, she could no longer maintain the smile on her face. She rushed towards me like a mad person and snatched my phone from my hand, angrily saying, "What are you all talking about? My grandson has just been born. The doctor said that newborn babies all look similar, and some are even uglier! You guys are really out of line. How can you comment on a little kid's looks like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura appeared extremely frustrated, so agitated that cold sweat broke out on her face, and her carefully applied makeup had smudged a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was sophisticated. Besides, the baby was just born. So, Grey eased the atmosphere and said, "Mrs. Bryant is right. Some newborn babies look wrinkled like old men, but they gradually grow up to be very good-looking. It's a joy for the Bryant family to have a grandson, and we shouldn't dampen their enthusiasm. We must go to the baby shower and join in the fun!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, yeah, I've seen a baby before that was much uglier than this one, but surprisingly, it grew up to a pretty baby. The Bryant family's genes are so good, so this child will definitely be good-looking in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, yeah, Mrs. Bryant, don't be angry. Congratulations, congratulations, you have a good grandson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Grey's remark, everyone quickly agreed and began speaking positively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura, who was previously very discouraged, finally showed a forced smile. "I also think so. When Elliott was just born, he didn't look good, like a skinny little monkey. But look at him now, how handsome he is. He's more handsome than all of your sons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura tried to get her dignity back. However, at that moment, I blurted out, "I heard that this child is not only premature but also has some heart issues. Mrs. Bryant, is he born with a congenital heart disease?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura managed to change the subject, but I deliberately brought up the topic she didn't want to talk about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Laura got really angry. She looked at me, so furious that she wished she could beat me up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I warned you, don't go too far! You cursed my grandson while bearing a </span><span>baby yourself, aren't you afraid of your own child facing consequences?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed. To be honest, whenever I look at the Bryant family now, I feel like I'm watching a drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The angrier they were, the happier I felt. Just right, I returned all the suffering I had endured in the past to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, don't be angry. My best friend is a doctor at this hospital, and I'm telling you the truth. Besides, what does it matter if the baby is ugly? He can always get plastic surgery when he grows up. As for his congenital heart disease, I don't think it's a big problem either. After all, medical science is so advanced now, he can just have surgery. Anyway, congratulations to Mrs. Bryant for finally realizing her dream of having a grandson. Although the quality of this grandson is worrying, at least he is the boy you have always dreamed of, which is good enough."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="627.html">« Prev</a><a href="629.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
