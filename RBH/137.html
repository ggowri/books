Regarding the previous proposal to make her the vice president, Austin directly abandoned it due to my obstruction and never mentioned it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dares to openly challenge me like this now, so I can't imagine what kind of situation Austin and I will face in the future if she really gains control of Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous life, both Austin and I were kept in the dark by Jade. By the time we realized it, we had already been rendered powerless by her and my cousin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this lifetime, I would not let Jade be arrogant anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she dared to provoke me with this matter, I must make this drama even more exquisite, and in the future, I will humiliate her severely, making it impossible for her to be so arrogant in Glory Group again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly went to Austin's office. At that time, besides Jade, the company's two major shareholders were also in the Austin office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at me with a serious expression. As soon as I entered, one of the shareholders said, "Madeline, we absolutely cannot choose an unknown actress to play the lead role in that play. This is the first play invested by Glory Group, not child's play, so you cannot fool around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. We put in a lot this time, so in case we incur losses, it's not just money that we will lose, but also the reputation of Glory Group," another shareholder immediately agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I anticipated that since Jade intended to argue with me, she would definitely bring reinforcements. And when she invited these two shareholders this time, I immediately understood in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that these two people had already secretly fought against her team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled faintly and asked calmly, "Is that so? If you think the actress I chose is not suitable, you should have suitable candidates to recommend, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have already recommended one to you before. Sylvia would be perfect for this play, as she not only has a professional background, but she has also starred in several popular dramas in recent years. The most important thing is that her asking price is not high, and it is completely within our budget. We clearly have better options, but I don't understand why you insist on using a newcomer," Jade immediately said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her fervently admire Sylvia, I became even more aware that my past marriage was unhappy and had something to do with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Sylvia had always been around Elliott, annoying me for a long time, before Giselle appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Jade deserves credit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Jade finished speaking, I didn't say anything else, but instead asked Austin's opinion first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin looked at me, his eyes filled with the same love as always. Even though they all opposed me, he still wanted to hear my thoughts. He said, "I think since Madeline wants to choose that newcomer, she must have her reasons. Madeline, could you explain to everyone, please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded. Then, I took out the USB flash drive that I had prepared earlier and inserted it into the LED screen in Austin's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, I showed them several clips of Audrey and Sylvia's initial makeup and audition sessions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I played several shots of Sylvia's audition first, and then played shots of Audrey's audition. After comparing them, it was clear that Audrey performed better than Sylvia in terms of acting skills, appearance, and the level of commitment and intensity during the performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't choose the leading actress out of thin air, but after repeated discussions with the directorial team. Even if you don't believe me, you should trust Frank's judgment. He has never made any bad films, so how would he be willing to let a newcomer ruin his reputation? Moreover, even though we are not professionals, based on the audition performance just now, I believe you all can feel that although Audrey may not have fame, her acting skills are indeed excellent. Her image is also youthful and beautiful, clearly more suitable for the role of the leading actress than Sylvia, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I argued my case, at this moment, the director of this play, Frank, knocked on Austin's office door.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="136.html">« Prev</a><a href="138.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
