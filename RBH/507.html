Finally, Adam called me again. "Madeline, I asked around. It's so messy here, and I couldn't find Quinn anywhere. I asked the person in charge of the hospital, but he didn't know. Many people were injured at the scene. And the armed police came to suppress the chaos. Now, the hospital is full of injured and high-fever patients. Should I keep looking for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Adam talk about the situation, I grew more and more anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An extremely bad feeling suddenly surged in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, no matter what happened to me, Quinn always rushed to me as soon as possible. This time, he suddenly lost contact. I had to do something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't sit still anymore and stood up. I told Adam, "Adam, you have been infected with the virus and are immune. You can stay there and continue searching for Quinn. I will set off immediately and meet you to search together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, I could no longer care about being pregnant. I just wanted to get Carthage as soon as possible. No matter what, I must find Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, but you are pregnant, and it is very dangerous here. You better not come. You can send several people from the company here!" Adam quickly stopped me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I can't feel at ease if I don't go there. I've been infected and immune, so it shouldn't be a problem," I said, having made up my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, I asked Isaac to arrange for two strong male colleagues who had been infected with the virus to accompany me to Carthage. They were Leonel and Hardy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we set off, it was already evening. Leonel and Hardy took turns driving, and I took a nap to regain my strength after getting in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took us about four hours from Hoswich to Carthage before we finally arrived at the highway intersection of Carthage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We had prepared relevant documents to get through. In the end, we successfully passed the checkpoint in the name of delivering supplies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the car moved to the city, I looked at the dilapidated houses and patchy roads on both sides of the road. I could imagine how poor Carthage was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We drove all the way to Carthage People's Hospital. Sure enough, before the car even got close to the gate, we saw the hospital entrance crowded with people coming to see the doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was far more chaotic than I imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed everyone in Carthage had been infected with the virus overnight. The hospital was overcrowded, and even driving into it was very difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people came to see a doctor due to a fever, and quite a few of them were not wearing masks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, I immediately asked Leonel to stop the car and distribute the masks we brought to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there were too many people. We gave out a few boxes of masks very soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the packed people, I couldn't help but feel numb. Leonel immediately said, "Ms. Mayers, let's go inside to find Quinn first. Otherwise, we'll be in trouble later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Have you contacted Adam? You go and park the car first. Hardy and I will go to find Adam," I told Leonel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Hardy and I pushed aside the crowd and trudged towards the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, I saw a man in a red vest and a medical mask walking from a short distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw that kind of red vest on Quinn's Instagram. In my impression, he belonged to this charity team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but feel ecstatic. I immediately emerged from the crowd and approached that person desperately!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="506.html">« Prev</a><a href="508.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
