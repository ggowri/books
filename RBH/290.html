Breakfast will be ready soon."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I responded quickly to the phone. Then, I quickly got up from the bed, changed my clothes, washed up, and went downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was wearing a black housecoat and was busy making breakfast in the kitchen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His figure was perfect. Although he was standing in the kitchen wearing ordinary home clothes, he was still eye-catching.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt itchy. I felt a sense of satisfaction overflowing from the bottom of my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked forward, held his slender waist from behind, and gently pressed my face against his back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my imagination, this breakfast should be exquisite and delicious. But as soon as I got closer to him, I smelled a slight burning smell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was confused and subconsciously glanced at the trash can.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did I realize that the trash can was already filled with half a basket of burnt eggs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the two on the dining table were indeed the two best-looking ones among the bunch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suppressed my smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked, "How long will it take for this breakfast to be ready?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's almost finished. Wait at the dining table, I'm cooking spaghetti now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned around and held me in his arms. We couldn't help but kiss again. Then, he pointed to the dining table and asked me to wait there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't go over but leaned against the door frame and watched him cook.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott started cooking spaghetti, but the order in which he cooked them was not right. Before the water boiled, he had already put the noodles into the pot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the still-hard spaghetti in the pot with a frown on his face. He looked helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Elliott didn't have any talent for cooking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why isn't this spaghetti soft?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't realize that I was still standing behind him and muttered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You put the spaghetti into the pot before the water boils. Of course, the spaghetti won't be soft. Let me do it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help laughing and said quickly behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and glanced at me </span><span>helplessly</span><span>. He didn't look dominating like he did last night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I put spaghetti in it after the water was boiled? No wonder</span><span> </span><span>I tried several times but failed."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I covered my mouth and snickered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. You'd better go and wait at the dining table and I'll do it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he left the kitchen, I started to make spaghetti. After a while, I took out two plates of spaghetti from the kitchen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott took a look at the two eggs that he had fried until they were mushy and then looked at the two plates of spaghetti that I cooked. He immediately gave me a thumbs-up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All right, Honey, you are great. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Try how it tastes."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words made me sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We must have consumed too much energy last night, so we both devoured the breakfast. Soon, we finished our respective spaghetti.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like an ordinary couple, we chatted all day long. The sun shines into the room from the window and shines on us. Everything seemed so peaceful and happy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I handed him a tissue and let him wipe his lips. He smiled slightly, took my hand, and naturally kissed it gently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Our eyes met, showing our deep affection for each other. It seemed that we couldn't make out enough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott walked around the dining table, picked me up, and carried me straight from the dining table to the sofa.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="289.html">« Prev</a><a href="291.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
