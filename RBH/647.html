I wanted to check through amniocentesis, but my mom didn't agree. Moreover, Grandpa desperately wished that Giselle could give birth to the child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not the reason. The real reason is that you also want that child to be born. Elliott, you didn't ... care about me as you think," I said calmly. I wanted to say "love," but it felt unusually awkward. After all, Elliott had never said he loved me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's Adam's apple bobbed. He suppressed the feeling of heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know my personality. If I didn't care, I wouldn't be standing in front of you right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up at him quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you truly cared about me, no one, for any reason, could have separated us. But unfortunately, we were separated. Actually, I have to thank you, thank you for pushing me away at that moment when I was about to fall in love with you again. Otherwise, the person in pain and despair right now would be me, not Giselle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott trembled for a moment. He moved his lips, but did not speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, I continued, "Don't you think that saying you care about me after everything has happened is useless? If you don't have anything else, can I leave?" My tone was indifferent because I didn't want Elliott to perceive any of my emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shouldn't you give me an explanation for everything that happened tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that I was leaving, Elliott continued to frown, his voice hoarse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want me to do? Should I turn myself in, or should I apologize to you, or compensate you for your emotional distress? I'm sorry, but I can't do any of those things. If you have any evidence to prove that I did tonight's incident, you can sue me, and I will be there to face it!" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott took a deep breath and then said, "You misunderstood me. I mean, since you ruined my engagement with Giselle, does that mean there is still a possibility for us to reconcile?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his tone, there was unexpectedly a trace of humble pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at him without moving and couldn't help but laugh, "Can a house that has been burned by a big fire be restored exactly the same? How could we possibly restore our relationship? Elliott, we are both adults, and besides, this doesn't seem like a question you would ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott appeared visibly flustered for a moment. He reached out and weakly clenched his fist on the edge of my car window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I also feel that the current me has become less and less like myself. However, you probably don't know that when I found out that the child was not mine, I felt joy in my heart. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was really incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was the man who was honest with me about his thoughts the same Elliott from before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I simply couldn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should be joyful. Having a child with Down syndrome will bring you a lot of trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I clearly knew what he meant, but I deliberately avoided the topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott chuckled self-deprecatingly, reaching out to touch my face. But just as his hand was halfway extended, I abruptly turned my face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand hung down weakly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you know I didn't mean that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? What did you mean then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I crossed my arms and turned my head to look at Elliott again, with an indifferent and fierce attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Adam's apple bobbed as if all the words were stuck in his heart. Finally, Elliott said, "With your attitude, it seems like I shouldn't continue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sounded dejected, and the hand resting on the car window drooped weakly, his expression instantly turning disappointed. At the same time, the once dazzling halo surrounding Elliott completely crumbled in my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to regard him as a god, wishing I could bow down and worship him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Elliott, in my eyes, was just an ordinary man. Maybe a bit more handsome, taller, and wealthier than the average man. But so what? There were many men like him around me now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, then I'll go back first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I checked the time and was about to start the car. But at that moment, Quinn suddenly called me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="646.html">« Prev</a><a href="648.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
