Then, I heard the sound of him unscrewing a bottle cap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held a bottle of water in his hand, then forcefully gripped my chin, pouring a bit of water into my mouth. However, I shook my head back and forth like a disobedient child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't want to drink water. I have only one intense desire, to make love with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, I heard his sigh. Then, abruptly, his lips silenced mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden initiative made me greedy all at once. I was fervently savoring the sweetness from his mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, he noticed I wasn't drinking water. So, he simply took a big gulp and gradually fed it into my mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lip to lip, it was truly the epitome of ambiguity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was clinging onto him, stuck to him like a charm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we're home now. Easy, I've brought you home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott swung the car door open, struggling to carry me out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt like I was on a swing, swaying back and forth in his arms. Before long, he led me into that familiar yet long-missed house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm in such agony, it's unbearable to the point I can't help but cry out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott swept me up the stairs in a swift motion, Sean's shouts faintly echoing from behind us:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, is that Mrs. Bryant you're holding? Is it? Have you two made up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't respond to his words. Instead, he swiftly swept me into the bedroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I inhaled the familiar yet long-lost scent in the bedroom, the same aroma that clung to Elliott. Next thing I knew, Elliott had tossed me into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned on the faucet. Amidst the sound of running water, I heard him say:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no other way, this is the only method to purge the drug from your system. Just bear with it. In a little while, I'll give you some hangover cure."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had no intention of taking advantage of someone's misfortune.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect him to be this restrained now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I curled up on the ground, feeling the warm water cascading down from above. This sensation finally brought me a great deal of comfort.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body no longer writhed in wild abandon, but gradually settled into a calm stillness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Elliott began to peel off my clothes one by one, before gently placing me into a bathtub filled with water. My breathing gradually steadied, but the desire within me was still so strong, I couldn't help but yearn for his touch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I draped my arms around Elliott's neck. Fully aware that I was stark naked, I still couldn't resist the urge to kiss him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gazed at me, his desire palpably stirred. His Adam's apple bobbed quickly. Despite this, he didn't touch me, but merely stroked my head gently, like any ordinary husband would.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetie, soak a bit longer and the medicinal effects will wear off. Wait here, I'll go get the medicine."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pried my hand open, then turned and walked out. In no time, he returned, this time with a white pill and a glass of water in his hands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, open wide."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was the epitome of gentleness, laced with a kind of enchantment. It made me unwittingly open my mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He popped the pill into my mouth. The slightly bitter taste made me frown in displeasure. I wanted to spit it out, but seeing my reaction, he quickly fed me water mouth-to-mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This method made the bitter pill not taste bitter at all, in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tangled with him once again. Because of my excessive force, he was yanked into the bathtub in an instant. The water drenched his clothes completely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I... I... miss you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sentence involuntarily popped out of my mouth, sounding so natural. Not just Elliott, even I was a bit taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did these words suddenly spill from my lips?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that fleeting moment, clarity began to seep back into my body. Instinctively, I wanted to push him away. However, my words ignited a sudden heat within Elliott. He steadied me by my shoulders, gripping my chin. His breath was ragged and hurried:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? You truly miss me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="792.html">« Prev</a><a href="794.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
