The company has given you the authority to supervise, if he doesn't listen to you, you can always approach your superior. And if that doesn't work, your superior can provide feedback to his superior. As long as you find a solution, the problem can always be resolved, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My counter-question made Giselle's eyes instantly dim, and she clearly felt guilty as she lowered her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered, "Madeline, you're right, I was too young and didn't have enough experience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was soft, and her facial expression was pitiful. To be honest, Giselle was not extraordinarily beautiful, but she did possess a captivating power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the feeling she gave me was like a wildflower growing in a valley or on the edge of a cliff, naturally making me unable to help but feel sorry for her and want to bring her home to take care of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending a long time with girls like Giselle, it was only natural for Elliott to develop a protective instinct towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, fortunately, the matter has been resolved, you don't have to blame yourself, my husband won't blame you either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of her, I never called Elliott by his name, just to let her know that I had a good relationship with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her head again, innocently looking at me, and suddenly asked, "Madeline, a few days ago I heard Elliott say that you guys are planning to get divorced, but I thought you had a good relationship. Is this true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and she had only recently met, and he actually told her, "I am getting divorced from him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was instinctively a little angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, was Elliott really planning to divorce me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even in the event of a divorce, what was his purpose in telling Giselle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had mixed feelings, but I didn't want Giselle to see that something was wrong with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I forced a smile and said, "How is that possible? We have a good relationship, and we are currently trying to conceive. As for divorce, he was probably joking with you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I closely watched Giselle's face, and every subtle expression on her face was observed by me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I distinctly felt that when I denied it, there was a hint of disappointment in her eyes, but in an instant, she pretended to smile with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Oh, I see. That's good then. I thought it was true and I was worried for you. Hearing you say that, I feel relieved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was really good at acting...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If in the previous life I had not seen her other face, and saw her sincere appearance now, I would also be unable to resist being moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately said, "You can rest assured, my husband and I will definitely be together for a lifetime, and my husband even said that he wants to have at least four children with me, two sons and two daughters. Giselle, why are you asking me these? Do you like my husband?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was too curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What does she really think of Elliott now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's face immediately changed when she heard me say that. She became anxious and quickly waved her hands, saying, "You misunderstand, of course I couldn't possibly like Elliott. Besides, there is such a big gap between Elliott and me. We could never be together. I don't mean anything else, I was just confused because Elliott said that to me that day."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="162.html">« Prev</a><a href="164.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
