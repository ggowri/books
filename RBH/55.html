She loves to show off so much, without even thinking what kind of occasion it is tonight. She's so audacious, directly recommending herself to Mr. Bryant. She has such great ambition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I couldn't tell either. She's usually so low-key. I didn't expect her to be so ambitious. Did you see that? Ms. Swift was unhappy just now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, she doesn't even think about her own abilities. Mrs. Bryant is so noble and beautiful. How could she, an ugly duckling, have to compare with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, what's so great about practicing the piano for many years? I've also been practicing for many years, but I didn't dare to make a sound."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff members from the same department as Giselle were dissatisfied with her wanting to show off and couldn't help but tease her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously glanced at Giselle out of the corner of my eye, only to see her still standing in the same spot. She desperately pursed her lips and clenched her hands, and in her unwilling gaze, there seemed to be glistening tears about to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She must feel very sad right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I interrupted their reunion like this. Would Elliott fall in love with her again in the future?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would things be changed as a result?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no idea what was going on in my mind, but at that moment, I had no time to think about it. The host had already explained the situation on stage, and I immediately adjusted my breathing. Accompanied by applause, I lifted my skirt and gracefully walked up to the stage, sitting in front of the white piano in the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I played a Chopin waltz, and I had been practicing this piece diligently at home for days, so I played it effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It has been a long time since I performed on stage. At this moment, I was completely immersed in the piano piece, ignoring the fact that I was on stage. I was solely focused on interpreting the music, and the smooth notes danced like playful spirits under my slender and agile fingers, taking me into a state of self-forgetfulness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the song came to an end, I was still left wanting more, and there was a moment of silence in the audience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't hear any applause, and I thought my performance was not good enough. However, to my surprise, just when I was doubting, the entire venue suddenly erupted with thunderous applause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood up and took a bow amidst applause, and as I turned to walk towards the audience, to my utter surprise, Elliott walked up on stage in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of everyone, he extended his hand towards me in a very gentlemanly manner. As I placed my hand on his, he bent down and gently kissed the back of my hand. Afterward, he gestured for me to hold his arm, and he personally supported me in walking down the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was undoubtedly Elliott's highest courtesy and best respect towards me on public occasions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Elliott, who once stood before me like a god.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was extremely surprised, and as he walked down the stage, he turned around to look at me and said the first sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never expected that you played the piano so well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I had never shown my strengths in front of him. All the impressions I left him with were nothing more than a difficult and dramatic woman, deeply infatuated with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old me only foolishly loved him, but never thought that a woman needed to have shining points on herself in order to receive a man's long-lasting love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Elliott's eyes were filled with tenderness, indulgence, and approval, and the gleam in his eyes was something I had never seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made me suddenly realize that in my previous life, I was so, so foolish. I was foolish enough to overlook all my strengths and instead, I caused myself to be battered and bleeding in love with all my weaknesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We locked eyes, and I couldn't help but smile with relief. I was happy that I had found myself again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Elliott was clearly infected by my smile. He couldn't help but embrace me, and then he gently kissed my forehead, softly saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the way! That's what makes you my wife."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="54.html">« Prev</a><a href="56.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
