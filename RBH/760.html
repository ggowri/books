You ought to go see him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Quinn responded with certainty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you afraid that after I see him, I might... reconcile with him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at Quinn, somewhat taken aback by his composure, yet realizing that this was the very quality that made Quinn so admirable and commendable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you two can truly forget the past and reconcile, and if he genuinely loves you, then I will sincerely wish you well. Love is never about holding someone hostage, it's about wanting to be with them. Madeline, there's never been a moment where I've wanted to force you to stay by my side."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked at me and laughed, a laugh so open and genuine. But I couldn't help but notice the sadness hidden within his smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He truly is that kind of exceptional man, so perfect it leaves no room for criticism. He would even go as far as to inconvenience himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reconciliation seems unlikely, I've said it before, I'm not one to look back. However, he got hurt because of me, I should at least go see him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled, feeling even more indebted to Quinn at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I get it, this kind of debt isn't exactly the kind of love you'd find between a man and a woman. But I've long since considered Quinn one of the most important people in my life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, after much hesitation, I finally clicked on the link Barry had sent me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never imagined that Elliott had signed up on a popular website, pouring out his innermost feelings and thoughts in words for the world to see.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All these words were penned down in the wee hours of the morning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Barry wasn't lying when he said he was battling insomnia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never understood what love tasted like until now. It's like a virus, invading your mind, corroding your heart, making you constantly crave her presence. But I have to resist, because she's no longer mine."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I used to despise men who drowned themselves in liquor. But now, because of her, I've fallen for the strongest spirits. Yet, I can no longer hold the one I love most in my arms as I drift off to sleep."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She always thought I didn't care about her, but she'll never know, she was the first woman in my life, and so far, the only one."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've done all I could, I'm at a loss for how to win her back. Loving someone, it's really tough."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's becoming more and more exceptional, attracting more and more people around her. I'm becoming less and less significant in her heart, and there's nothing I can do about it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her departure has made my once-prideful career seem insignificant. I spent the entire meeting today thinking about her. If this continues, I seriously wonder if I'm sick, or if she's implanted a chip in my brain."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I find myself consumed by this insane urge to accept her and everything about her, even if the child she bears isn't mine. All I want is for her to return to my side. I think, I must be going mad."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="759.html">« Prev</a><a href="761.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
