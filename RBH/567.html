Elliott exclaimed. In the next moment, I found myself in Elliott's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." I wanted to say I was fine, but I felt incredibly dizzy. Elliott's face seemed to multiply into countless heads before me. The world spun, and I couldn't steady myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm taking you to the hospital right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott lifted me and placed me in his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty minutes later, he brought me to the affiliated hospital of the Bryant Group and rushed me into the emergency room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I regained consciousness, I was in a ward with an IV drip attached to my arm. I glanced at the white walls and the overhead light, feeling inexplicably nervous, wanting to pull out the needle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of medication did you give me? I'm pregnant. Some medicines shouldn't be used carelessly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't panic, the doctors know. We've given you a nutrient solution. You had low blood sugar along with malnutrition." Elliott sat beside me. Seeing me attempting to remove the needle, he quickly pressed my hand, speaking softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing it was a nutrient drip, my tense emotions eased. I glanced at him, then looked around the room. "Am I in the Bryant Group's affiliated hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. I had the doctor check you over while we were here. You're fine, and so is your baby. But you're over four months pregnant?" Elliott looked at me with a hint of suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no. He must have figured out the approximate date of my conception. With his sharp mind, he would surely be suspicious. How could I have fainted in front of him?" I thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was trying to think of an excuse to deceive him when the door to the ward was pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, is Madeline awake?" Giselle asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head to see Giselle in hospital attire, her belly swollen, her complexion pale, and her figure bloated. The back of her hands bore marks from countless injections, making her look like a woman in her thirties or forties with no vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She must be tormented by the constant injections of drugs to maintain her pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her current state, any passerby would believe she was forty years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but be taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's awake. Why did you come over? Didn't the doctor advise you to rest?" Elliott turned to look at Giselle, his brow furrowing instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was worried about Madeline, so I came to check on her. Madeline, are you okay?" Giselle approached, supporting her belly as she walked, eyeing me. Her tone was soft, but I couldn't decipher her intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. Thank you for your concern," I replied lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because I didn't need to stay in the hospital, Elliott didn't ask the nurse to change my clothes. I was still wearing the dress I wore during the speech, and my makeup was still intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My skin hadn't deteriorated because of Marcus's tailored pregnancy medication and my yoga practice. If anything, it had become more radiant. My figure hadn't changed much either. From the outside, I only appeared slightly fuller than before, still looking glamorous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle stared at me intently. I could distinctly feel the envy in her eyes. Finally, she couldn't help but say, "Madeline, I watched your speech on TV today. It was brilliant. You really have the demeanor of a leader. No wonder Elliott was willing to postpone such an important shareholder meeting for the Bryant Group just to attend in person."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="566.html">« Prev</a><a href="568.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
