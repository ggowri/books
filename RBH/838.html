The moment I held him in my arms, he stopped crying and stared at me with wide eyes. He looks so well-behaved and incredibly cute.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah's face had filled out considerably, and his skin was incredibly fair. His eyes were large, framed by long lashes, and he was starting to look more and more like Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah's eyes are truly captivating. He's bound to grow up to be a smart one," Quinn complimented, standing next to me with a beaming smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he's definitely gonna be a heartthrob when he grows up, gonna have girls swooning left and right." My mom chimed in, grinning from ear to ear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely. Madeline is stunning, how could her child be anything less? We've got some good genes in our family!" Austin said, beaming with pride.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment my dad said this, everyone burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, it seemed as if Noah could understand our praises, and he responded with a joyful laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah's laughter was nothing short of angelic. The moment he laughed, the four of us couldn't help but join in...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We all tacitly skirted around the topic that shouldn't be mentioned. But I knew, everyone present understood what was going on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After having dinner at my place, Quinn headed back home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Quinn left, Lily summoned me to her room. She retrieved a red box from her safe. Upon opening it, a large gold necklace was revealed, accompanied by a pair of gold bracelets and anklets.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, did you buy these?" I asked, my eyes wide at the sight of the gold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The stuff I ordered for Noah hasn't arrived yet. This set was brought over by Quinn, she said her mom had it specially made for Noah. Your dad and I weighed it, all these items together, they're over a hundred grams. The Woods family seems to value you a lot, have you explained Noah's situation to them?" My mom looked at me, her voice laced with concern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last time I went over for dinner, I spilled the beans. I thought they wouldn't approve of Huai Zhou and me being together, but surprisingly, his parents were pretty open-minded. It left me at a loss," I confessed to Lily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my words, Lily breathed a sigh of relief, "You told them the truth, didn't you? Your father and I were worried they might be in the dark. Quinn is a good guy, well-mannered, and his parents must be open-minded and easy to get along with. What's your plan moving forward? They've given such a generous gift, your father and I are thinking of inviting them over for dinner as a token of our gratitude."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily held my hand, her question leaving me somewhat dazed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should I do?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, I'm at a loss myself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I know Quinn has been good to me, as has the Woods family. I've also promised Quinn that once Elliott's health improves, I'll be with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when exactly we got together, how we got together, I never really dwelled on those details.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, let's talk about the future when it comes, I still need to think things through. Inviting them for dinner sounds good. Last time, Noah received a lot of clothes and toys from his mom and sister. We really should return the favor with a meal, otherwise, we might come off as impolite."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to think long and hard about your marriage. You won't come across someone like Quinn again easily. You've already made one mistake, don't make a second one." Lily said, gripping my hand.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="837.html">« Prev</a><a href="839.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
