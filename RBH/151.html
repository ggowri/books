His gaze was extremely cold, carrying a fierce and icy indifference, without a trace of affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My hands instinctively braced against the bed as I attempted to sit up, while Elliott had already taken off his suit jacket and shirt, presenting his entire upper body in front of me, along with his noticeably defined eight-pack abs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what were you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My eyes were filled with vigilance, as a very bad thought flooded my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do, what couples should do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, and once again he pounced on me, pressing me against the edge of the bed. He gave me no room to escape and bit directly into my neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, it was a bite, and it hurt so much that I couldn't help but let out a soft cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You used to say that you would never have sex with me in your whole life. So, are you going to make an exception tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively reached out to touch the spot on my neck where he had bitten me, and to my surprise, it felt sticky and gooey. He had bitten me and drawn blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How much does this bastard hate me in the end?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I changed my mind!" he said coldly in my ear, and then he bit my ear. "Instead of letting you be on stage, seductively dancing for other men to watch, I'd rather make you complete."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fulfilled your wish...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hehe, these few words were still spoken with such arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did he think of me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he think that I was still the woman who waited eagerly for his favor and pity in the past?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doesn't he really realize that I have changed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did what I said to him and my actions these days have no effect at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I don't need your help. Go and help other women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strong resistance from within compelled me to push him away with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this time Elliott seemed determined to conquer me, as if he had unleashed all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the clothes on me and the clothes on him were all forcefully pulled off by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at Elliott with wide eyes, even though at this very moment our skins were touching each other, even though we were doing the most intimate thing between a husband and wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I felt no sweetness in my heart at all, on the contrary, I felt an inexplicable shame, an indescribable shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably sensed my gaze, and my lack of desire must have annoyed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply "snapped" off the light in the room and then once again pressed down on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made it clear that he was determined to conquer me tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that once a man used brute force, it was futile for a woman to struggle no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I didn't struggle, I just lay motionless in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His kisses fell on me like raindrops once again, however, I felt no slightest tremor. Instead, I felt my body as cold as a stone, with absolutely no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't you find it boring to conquer a woman only with your body, without love?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I said it before, I didn't love you anymore. Don't you find it ridiculous the way you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I no longer cling to you, can we, perhaps, let each other go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I muttered to myself over and over again, speaking to him and also speaking to myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I weakly pulled the bedsheet with both hands, and the grievances in my heart flooded like seawater. My tears also overflowed from my eyes without me realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe my words had an effect, as I could feel his enthusiasm gradually being extinguished by me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, realizing that no matter what he did, I wouldn't give him any reaction, Elliott stopped all his actions, he gave up dejectedly, collapsed beside me, and let out a heavy sigh.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="150.html">« Prev</a><a href="152.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
