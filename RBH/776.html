My voice involuntarily hitched higher.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what was that you were just chirping in my ear? Quite the chatterbox, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was truly awake this time. Not only did he speak, but he also turned his head to look around. He seemed somewhat surprised to find himself in a hospital. Before I could say anything, he raised his hand to his forehead, furrowed his brows, and muttered under his breath:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening to me? How did I end up in a hospital?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You forgot you're injured? Elliott, you're usually so sharp. How could you run off to Ruini all by yourself? Don't you know how dangerous that is?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Elliott truly awake, I instantly relaxed, unable to resist giving him a good scolding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was just unconsciously venting my inner emotions. But to my surprise, when I voiced these words, Elliott suddenly looked up, staring at me with utter astonishment:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Babe, what on earth are you talking about? When did I ever go to Ruini? Didn't we just get back from hiking in Cathage?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could you please provide a document or a text that needs to be translated or edited? Your request is not clear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Returning from a mountain hike?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth is Elliott talking about?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And besides, we've been divorced for so long, why is he suddenly calling me honey?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze, stuttering:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what are you on about? Something about climbing Cathage, but you're clearly..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call me honey, don't address me by my name!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott cut me off. He looked at me sternly, his tone assertive, carrying an inherent, undeniable pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excuse me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was momentarily stunned. Should I call him honey?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's up with him?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come closer, don't stay so far away from me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could even react, Elliott was already sitting up, leaning casually against his hospital bed. His voice was deep and raspy, perhaps due to just waking up, and it carried a magnetic quality. He gestured for me to come closer with a crook of his finger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found myself at a loss, staring at this version of Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what are you up to? We've been divorced for ages, quit playing these games."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, you're always quick to mention divorce," Elliott suddenly teased, poking my nose affectionately. Before I could react, he scooped me into his arms. "Alright, I promise to be devoted to you, to put you first. Can we stop talking about divorce, please?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was truly gentle, sending shivers down my spine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing something off about him, I struggled to break free, eager to escape his embrace. But unexpectedly, he suddenly gripped the back of my head, planting a kiss on my lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, I quickly clamped my lips shut and shoved him away with all my strength. I yelled out in anger:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, have you lost your marbles?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let me go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was slightly panting, ignoring the fury in my eyes, his face adorned with a gentle, intoxicating smile:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you acting like a feral kitten, always ready to scratch and claw? Come on, let's go home."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="775.html">« Prev</a><a href="777.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
