I can see the smugness on her face!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What does she have to be proud of? She is just a snake lurking in the shadows, waiting for the opportunity to devour everything from others!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't contain my anger anymore, and at that moment, without thinking, I slapped her face hard!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crisp sound echoed in the hallway. Fueled by genuine hatred, I didn't hold back in the slightest, putting all my strength into that slap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her entire face shifted to one side from the force of my slap, and a bright red handprint appeared on her skin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My entire body trembled with anger, and if murder wasn't a crime, if I had a knife in my hand at that moment, I might have stabbed it directly into her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admitted that I hated her intensely. The hatred from the previous life and this life had accumulated into a river of tears and blood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A reprimanding voice suddenly rang out in the hallway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the familiar voice, I raised my head in astonishment, only to see Elliott standing not far from us in a suit, with his trusted assistant Barry behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, Madeline suddenly hit me for no reason!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle instantly covered her face, crying out to Elliott with a hint of a sob in her voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My hand was still numb, and as I watched Elliott approach me and Giselle, I felt no fear, only despair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you suddenly attack Giselle for no reason?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me with a cold and stern gaze, his protective stance towards Giselle mirroring his behavior from the previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt even more despair, and I let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with hitting her? Are you feeling sorry for her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You hit her and you're still so unapologetic? What did she do to provoke you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him with a cold smile, feeling a chill in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly found it ironic. The sweet two days in Louis City felt like a dream, and I even doubted if that was the real Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really thought we could start over, but now reality had shown me once again how naive I was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't blame Madeline. I was in the wrong, I shouldn't have stayed up so late with you last night..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle pitifully tugged at Elliott's shirt hem, biting her lip and desperately holding back tears, looking truly heart-wrenching.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood still, my body stiff, looking at Elliott and Giselle with a cold smile the whole time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that the best way for me, in this situation, was to follow Giselle's example and act weak towards Elliott to have a chance of being with him in the long run.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But my pride wouldn't allow me to do that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said, "You know what you did last night, you know it well! Madeline, you've gone too far!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood with his hands in his pockets, looking down at me with a stern gaze, which made me shiver inexplicably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gust of wind suddenly blew through the hallway, shaking my body and almost knocking me over. Giselle, in front of me, immediately hugged Elliott's arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pouted and said, "Elliott, let it go. I don't blame Madeline, and you shouldn't be angry either."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="236.html">« Prev</a><a href="238.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
