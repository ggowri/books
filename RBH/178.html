Are you feeling uncomfortable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I heard Elliott's gentle voice, I knew it was Giselle calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know what Giselle said on the phone, Elliott said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I will come over in a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott hung up the phone, turned around, and looked at me with a calm expression. Seeing that I was still looking at him, he asked me casually,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I went to buy breakfast for you, what do you want to eat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buy me breakfast... Shouldn't you be going to see Giselle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admired Elliott's composure, his eyes were clear as if there was nothing between him and Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine, Giselle woke up. You go and check on her first, I'm fine, not hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately burst this matter to see what his reaction would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to my surprise, Elliott remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I will go and have a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned around and walked out of the ward. He hurriedly walked away, and from his hasty figure, I could vaguely sense his concern and worry for Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I half leaned on the pillow, the warmth of him still lingering in the bed. The room was filled with his presence, and I could feel that I was suffocating, I was unhappy, very unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up my phone and called Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, were you working?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you feeling better, my dear? I was planning to take a day off today and come see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wanted to transfer to your place, and I didn't want Elliott to know. Can you make it happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held the phone and asked urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I am currently in a private hospital, where the conditions and environment are top-notch, but I feel that the atmosphere here is too oppressive. It is so oppressive that I can't wait to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now? Alright, wait for me, I will handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona has always been decisive. She is not as nosy as Paige and doesn't love asking me a bunch of questions. Whenever I have any demands and approach her, she won't ask for the reasons, but only assess if she can accomplish it. If she can, she will immediately solve it for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after Fiona hung up the phone, she had already arranged everything and called me to say that she could help me with the transfer, as long as I agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, not long after, Fiona's hospital ambulance drove directly to the hospital I was in. I quickly packed up all my belongings, and Fiona arranged for my transfer. I then left directly in that ambulance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole process took only half an hour, and as the ambulance I was sitting in drove out of the hospital gate, I saw Elliott hurriedly walking in from outside the hospital. Behind him, Barry was holding two breakfasts in his hands, obviously one for me and one for Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't that Elliott? Is he buying breakfast for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona saw me staring in that direction, so she asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I bought for others, I just benefited from it. Fiona, do you think I should be grateful that now, in his eyes, at least he is not ignoring me anymore, but treating me equally with other women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed at myself, my heart had already become numb, and I didn't care about pain or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, that's it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona angrily hammered my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you need to be so humble? There are no three-legged frogs in the world, but men with two legs are everywhere. Is it necessary for you to degrade yourself and share a man with others?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="177.html">« Prev</a><a href="179.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
