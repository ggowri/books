He immediately stood up and said to Goree, "Of course, I want to meet them. Please bring them in quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't Baxter's family Giselle and her mother Nicole?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know that they came to visit today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what did they come here for today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was very curious. And at that moment, Goree had already welcomed Giselle and Nicole in from the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle carried a large bag of things, which seemed to be some kind of specialty. The two of them had specially dressed up today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was wearing a blue dress, which had a simple and elegant style, making her look even more pure. Nicole, on the other hand, was wearing a long dress, with her hair tied up high, appearing quite graceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, Laura, long time no see. Elliott, Madeline, you are also here today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Giselle walked in, she immediately greeted us with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper and Laura stood up at this moment, and Elliott and I also stood up. Laura immediately walked forward and affectionately grabbed Giselle's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God! Time passed so quickly! Giselle, you have become so beautiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Laura. I haven't seen you in years. I didn't expect you to have changed at all, still so young."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle smiled and looked at Laura, appearing very familiar with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a moment ago, Laura, who was very enthusiastic towards me, saw Giselle and her eyes were filled with affection. She immediately invited Giselle and Nicole to sit at the table, and specifically asked Giselle to sit next to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, I heard that you received scholarships every year in college and also participated in many extracurricular activities. You have worked so hard, and it is not in vain for us to nurture you. If you still want to continue studying abroad for further education, please let us know, and we will do our best to support you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Giselle appeared, Laura's eyes never left Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She excitedly praised Giselle's outstanding performance in college and seemed very proud of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time I saw Laura's enthusiasm towards Giselle with my own eyes, I finally understood why Laura, who valued her family background so much in her past life, could accept Giselle joining the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, there were many past events between them that I didn't know about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, over the years, I am truly grateful for your support and help to our family. It's just that my mother is getting older. I want to stay by her side, start working early, and lighten her burden. By the way, I am currently working at Bryant Group. Elliott has also been taking good care of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle smiled and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, Elliott added, "Yes. Giselle's overall performance after joining Bryant Group was good. She worked very hard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head and glanced at Elliott, only to see him smiling at Giselle. At that moment, his smile was as warm as a spring breeze, completely devoid of his usual dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It can be seen that the whole family loves Giselle very much. Moreover, Giselle's father Baxter once saved Jasper's life. With this relationship, Jasper and Laura cannot treat her badly either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I thought about it, a strange feeling welled up in my heart.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="118.html">« Prev</a><a href="120.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
