He approached it and curiously scanned the various action figures I had collected since childhood, the books I had purchased, my photo album documenting my growth, and the journal sitting on my desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instinctively reached out to grab the diary because the cover photo of the diary was a picture of him that I had secretly taken when he was playing basketball in college. Later, I specifically had someone make it into the cover of this diary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thick diary recorded my obsession and love for him during my student years. Every day, every month, every year, every word and every sentence documented every little detail of my love for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was really crazy back then, I fell for him at first sight since my freshman year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since then, wherever he went, I quietly followed behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what event he attended, I would crazily take photos with my camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter who he was with or where he went, I knew it like the back of my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even during the days when he was studying abroad, I would secretly buy a plane ticket and fly to the United States, just to catch a glimpse of him from afar, and then return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was the longest dream I had in my entire youth, and this diary is just one of the many snapshots of my long unrequited love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I once thought that one day, I would marry Elliott. I was determined to give him this diary as a gift, to let him know how much I loved him and how deeply I cared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But later, after I really married him, I finally experienced what disappointment truly feels like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything I once cherished was insignificant in Elliott's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been a part of my youth for so many years, but to him, I was just a woman who used every means to marry him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything that I considered important simply didn't matter at all to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And how could I have the audacity to shamelessly hand over my diary to him again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The diary has been sealed in my drawer ever since, and it was only recently that I opened the drawer and took it out to place it on the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect it, but by a stroke of luck, Elliott happened to see it this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this... me?" Elliott stared at the photo on the cover, examining it closely with a sense of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that was several years ago," I said faintly after a few seconds of confusion, hastily stepping forward and snatching the diary from his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this a diary? Written for me?" Elliott raised an eyebrow, turning to look at me, asking incredulously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had long lost the idea of wanting him to read this diary. I denied directly, "Of course not, it's just a notebook from my student days, quite childish stuff, nothing interesting to see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I put the diary directly into the drawer and then closed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For me now, the strong desire to make him aware of my feelings has long faded away. I am not the naive and reckless person I was back then, nor am I foolish enough to believe that Elliott will love me more just by seeing how much I loved him in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is it possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had already appeared in his world, our separation was just a matter of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time I think about this, I feel that it is quite ironic for us to continue pretending to be a loving couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see, is it about me?" he said.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="184.html">« Prev</a><a href="186.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
