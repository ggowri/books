Although Elliott had managed to make it, he seemed to have added too much seasoning, causing the omelet to look dull, and his steak looked mediocre at best.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I barely managed to suppress a laugh as Elliott, looking a bit awkward, said, "They don't look too great, do they? Maybe you should cook the remaining two dishes?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you go take a break."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Elliott drenched in sweat, I finally couldn't hold back my laughter. I walked into the kitchen, took out the remaining ingredients, and quickly started cooking them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since these ingredients were pre-prepped and already washed and cut, I only needed to add some seasoning and cook them, so the remaining two dishes were ready in less than ten minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also washed the fresh mushrooms we bought and made a delicious mushroom soup, then served the dishes one by one on the table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dishes I made were quite ordinary. But when they were placed next to Elliott's, they looked particularly appetizing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the dishes, his expression turned a bit embarrassed, yet he had to admit, "Yours are definitely better."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's your first time cooking, it's normal not to do well. If you want to learn, I can teach you," I said with a smile, winking at Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled back, "Yeah, that sounds good."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I went to get some cutlery, and then we sat down to eat, facing each other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no interruptions from servants or butlers, and despite the ordinary dishes, this meal made me feel remarkably at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I mused, "Is this what life is like for ordinary married couples?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the two of us going grocery shopping together and cooking together right after. It's these simple moments that make you feel love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, my days with Elliott felt like we were living in a dream, and everything felt so surreal."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to feel the same. He kept praising the food while sharing it with me. Elliott usually controlled his diet, but this time, he ate more than usual without realizing it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then suddenly suggested, "How about we set aside one day every week to cook together, sound good?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pondered, "Is he planning to seriously settle down with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I then looked up into Elliott's eyes. He spoke so sincerely, yet once again, I couldn't help but think of Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like a shadow that lingered everywhere in our world, constantly hovering between me and Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I unintentionally blurted out, "Sure, but Giselle just posted on Instagram, and it looks like she's in your office."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't restrain myself from asking the question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Elliott was taken aback. He then took out his phone, clicked open it to look, and soon had a realization.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, that..." He thought about it for a moment before explaining, "The marketing department was shooting some promotional photos and they temporarily asked her to model in my office just for the backdrop."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wondered, "Is that the real story? But why did Giselle post that photo on Instagram, and why did she add such ambiguous captions?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was still a bit skeptical and continued, "I see, but her caption sounds a bit strange. It sounds like she's thinking of someone."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that, Elliott glanced at his phone again and then dismissively chuckled, "I don't know about that. I'm not interested in guessing a young girl's thoughts. What are you thinking about in that little head of yours?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="205.html">« Prev</a><a href="207.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
