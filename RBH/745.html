Her terrifying tone made me scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? Jade, are you using Quinn to threaten me? Is your real intention to deceive me into coming here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately realized and looked at Jade in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing her words, I seemed to understand something, and I couldn't help but ask immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are truly my sister, so clever! As soon as I reminded you, you understood. I underestimated you in the past. I thought you were just a silly girl caught up in love, but I didn't expect you to be so smart. You desire love so much. Let me help you test those two men and see which one loves you more, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately guessed her intention. Jade suddenly burst into laughter, and then she viciously slapped me twice. At the same time, she also took out her phone and recorded this scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jade, what do you want to do? If you want money, just tell me how much you want, I can give it to you! As long as you release my companion and me, everything will be up to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what she wanted to do, so I immediately shouted at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I anxiously looked around. I had thought that the people from Dehan would arrive quickly, but it had been so long and no one came to rescue us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was there any situation or accident?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was very scared, and at that moment, Jade gave a sinister smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let you go? Don't be joking, capturing someone as important as you was not easy at all. If I let you go, can I still get the money? Madeline, I have watched you succeed in your career these past two years, while I have been kicked out of the family. I have been living in poverty! Do you know how jealous I am? Let's change the place, and I will tell you in detail about my experiences these past two years, let's... let's have a good talk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Jade finished speaking, she used her eyes to signal her people. Her two subordinates instantly understood and immediately tied me and Jane up. At the same time, they also stuffed rags into our mouths. Soon, they escorted us toward the slope behind us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is the border line, and on the other side of the hill is Mexico. Once Jane and I are taken to Mexico by them, rescuing us will become very difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I originally thought that Dehan would appear soon, so I took the risk of getting off the car to delay time in order to prevent Jane from being tortured by them. But I didn't expect that Dehan's person would still not appear for so long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were being dragged by them toward the hillside, and at that moment, I was very anxious and angry. Perhaps I was too impatient, but suddenly a warm current surged from within me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately after, I felt a severe stomachache!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="744.html">« Prev</a><a href="746.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
