I rose to my feet, shook her hand briefly before letting go. I said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Madeline. We're like two peas in a pod. I never thought there'd be someone in this world who mirrors me so closely."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Our eyes met, and a smile spread across both our faces, as if on cue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her, even her smile bore an uncanny resemblance to mine. In that moment, a peculiar sensation rapidly spread through the depths of my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was my first time taking a close look at her. I found that indeed, our auras were strikingly similar. But upon closer inspection, our facial features were distinctly different. The most notable difference, however, lay in our eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My eyes are round and bright, full of life. Hers, however, are long and narrow, reminiscent of a fox's, with a slight upward tilt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, her smile gave me a fox-like vibe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," she responded softly to my words, then turned her gaze to Quinn. "Mr. Woods, I heard from Zara that today's your birthday. Happy Birthday. As a token of our first meeting, I've brought a bottle of fruit wine. It's a special blend my father makes with various fruits. You can't find this on the market, it's known for its beautifying properties. Shall I open it now to celebrate your birthday?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really do resemble Madeline, anyone would think you're sisters. I've heard about you from Zara, mentioned that your family has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine. I bet the wine your father brews is something extraordinary. How about we crack it open and give it a taste?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, being a natural at socializing, responded on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a subtle smile, Lisa pulled out a bottle of wine from the black gift box she carried.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hue of this wine is a vibrant orange-yellow, resembling a glass of fresh juice. It's housed in an aesthetically pleasing bottle, exuding an air of sophistication and class.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa uncorked the bottle in public. Instantly, a rich fruity aroma wafted through the air, even more enticing than the usual scent of champagne.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa lined up the wine glasses, filling each one to the brim. Then, she signaled everyone to raise their glasses, toasting to Quinn's birthday.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Happy Birthday!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Happy Birthday, Quinn!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's to Quinn becoming even more handsome!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls' blessings echoed instantly, filling the room with laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, I would find such a situation somewhat awkward. But Quinn, he had a knack for making sure I didn't feel the slightest bit uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of everyone, he filled his glass again after finishing his drink, then raised a toast just to me. With a smile, he said to me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I'm thrilled you could join me for my birthday today. I hope for every birthday hereafter, you'll be by my side."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn truly didn't want to hide his feelings for me, not even a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls in the room could all see it. Suddenly, they lost interest in approaching Quinn, and Kase started to drink on his own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fruit wine Lisa brought was delicious, boasting a unique flavor with a hint of sweetness that didn't burn the throat. Before I knew it, I'd already had a few glasses.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn had a few drinks too. We were chatting away, but as the conversation went on, I could feel the alcohol starting to kick in. I was getting a bit woozy, unable to sit still, and my cheeks began to flush with warmth...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given my previous tolerance, this amount of alcohol should've been a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that my health has deteriorated due to recently giving birth?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, there's something off about the wine Lisa brought?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blinked, my gaze instinctively shifting towards Lisa. Yet, sipping on the same drink, Lisa seemed utterly unaffected. She was as composed as ever, deeply engrossed in a lively conversation with a group of girls.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Must be my poor tolerance for alcohol, I thought. I decided to get up and splash some water on my face in the bathroom to sober up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the moment I rose to my feet, I found them oddly shaky. It was as if a flicker of flame was surging upwards within me, igniting a sudden thrill in my nerves.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Quinn there, I felt an overwhelming urge to just throw caution to the wind and rush to him...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="788.html">« Prev</a><a href="790.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
