Since Elliott said I could leave, I couldn't ask for more. After I finished speaking, I wanted to push open the car door and get out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly said, "Find a time to renew the contracts of Glory Group and Bryant Group. The prices will remain the same as before, I have already spoken to them, and there will be no price increase."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I have already found a new partner. The collaboration between Glory Group and Bryant Group can be terminated by the end of this month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned, and then decisively refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words shocked Elliott. He became angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you saying that you were with Benjamin and Grey today, discussing a collaboration? Benjamin's company has developed a new motor, but its performance is currently unstable. Aren't you afraid of the consequences of using a new product without caution?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that Elliott was very dissatisfied with me cutting off cooperation with them, so he deliberately provoked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The market has always been about updates and replacements. If the old ones don't go, the new ones won't come. People are like this, and so are products. I appreciate your </span><span>kindness, goodbye, Mr. Bryant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Elliott, calmly smiled slightly, and then, without hesitation, pushed open the car door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gust of cold wind blew into the car at that moment, and at the same time, I heard Elliott's voice behind me, filled with an inexplicable sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you now determined to cut off all ties with me in every aspect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hesitated for a few seconds, but I didn't turn back. Instead, I quickly got out of the car and walked towards the entrance of Glory Group with determined steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, it was the end of the month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the termination of our cooperation with Bryant Group, we successfully signed a three-year contract with Benjamin's company, Infinite Precision. Meanwhile, Fiona also gave me the paternity test report that she had secretly done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really didn't expect it, but everything turned out exactly as I had anticipated. The child that Giselle gave birth to was actually not Elliott's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that Giselle dare to lie to the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really had the courage and she really seemed crazy to become a member of the Bryant family. No wonder Giselle was so eager to get engaged to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Louis had a strong suspicion of existence. I don't know how much benefit Giselle gave him for him to be willing to take such a risk, providing a fake paternity test report, and making the Bryant family mistakenly believe that the child was Elliott's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, there was such a big secret hidden behind the child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was so bold. Wasn't she afraid of being discovered and embarrassing herself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found the whole thing unbelievable. And just at that moment, the news of the Bryant family hosting a grand baby shower and engagement banquet started to circulate in high society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I had expected it because my grand gift had already been prepared. I was just waiting for their engagement day to give them a pleasant surprise!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="634.html">« Prev</a><a href="636.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
