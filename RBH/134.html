His eyes seemed to stare from hell, profound and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn obviously saw Elliott as well. However, he chose to ignore Elliott directly and quickly opened the car door. Afterward, he carried me to the side of the car, preparing to open the car door and put me in the back seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Elliott approached. Without saying a word, he directly pulled me off Quinn's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He obviously didn't realize that my foot was injured. At the moment he pulled me down, my foot touched the ground and it hurt so much that I couldn't help but cry out. I couldn't support my whole body and instantly fell to the ground due to the unstable center of gravity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What were you doing? Did you know that she hurt her foot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn became furious, and he couldn't help but roar at me, pointing his finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I propped myself up on the ground with both hands, glaring at Elliott. I attempted to stand up from the ground, as I no longer wanted him to see any of my vulnerable sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to have just noticed the bandages wrapped around my feet, and his eyes were clearly filled with shock. However, he still said coldly, "Shouldn't you explain to me what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that, compared to me being injured, what he is more concerned about is what exactly is going on between me and Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She got hurt, Elliott!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was clearly dissatisfied with his indifferent attitude, so he clenched his fists and gritted his teeth again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott only glanced briefly at my feet, his indifferent expression piercing my heart like a thorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I didn't know where the strength came from, but it compelled me to stand up in pain. Right in front of Elliott, I intimately held onto Quinn's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's how we used to do it. Do you need me to demonstrate it more clearly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because my feet were hurting so much, the moment when I grabbed onto Quinn's arm, my entire body weight shifted towards him, and I leaned against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn sensed my weakness, so he immediately supported my waist with his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's eyes suddenly filled with anger, his face extremely furious, no less than the coldness of the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you were deliberately provoking me, weren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Elliott. I told you that if you didn't agree to the divorce, we would each live our own lives without interfering with each other. Quinn, let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said in a deep voice, my tone was extremely indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to stay in the same place for another second. Right now, I just wanted to get away from Elliott, as fast as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the pain in my feet, I climbed into Quinn's car with big strides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I felt sticky at the bottom of my feet. I knew I must have bled a lot when I was struggling just now, but I didn't care as much anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how painful the footache was, it couldn't compare to the feeling of heartache, so I had completely become numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you not only disregard her, but you don't even see her as a person. What does Madeline really mean to you in your eyes? Is she a human being or just an object? You're very curious about what happened last night, aren't you? Go watch the surveillance footage yourself, I can't be bothered to explain it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was also infuriated by Elliott's behavior. After yelling at Elliott, he turned around and got into the car directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped on the accelerator and took me away like that. Through the rearview mirror, I saw Elliott standing there with a straight posture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was like a still sculpture, until we drove far away, but he remained motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you feel pain, Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Quinn asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. Just turn left up ahead and you'll reach my house. You can drop me off there, and I'll make my own way back," I said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to me, Quinn turned and parked the car in front of my house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what I said, he still insisted on carrying me to my doorstep. The moment I entered the password to unlock the door, Austin walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Austin saw Quinn carrying me, he clearly paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My father loved me very much, so he immediately noticed that the bandage on my foot had turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at my feet intently and exclaimed loudly, "Madeline, what happened to you? Why are your feet injured? Quickly, sit on the couch and let me take a look."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="133.html">« Prev</a><a href="135.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
