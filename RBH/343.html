So we waited outside the operating room for about an hour.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, my dad finally came out of the operating room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a joint consultation with several doctors, they decided to give my dad a conservative treatment plan with ultrasonic nerve stimulation and traditional drugs to see if my dad could wake up from his deep sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three of us, including Elliott, my mom, and me, had a discussion about this plan. All of us agreed to the doctor's treatment plan. The doctor said that if this treatment plan was feasible, my dad's condition would improve soon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was probably the only good news I'd heard in a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother was very excited when she heard this news, which made her love Elliott more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said she wanted to go back home and cook some dishes and soup for me and Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing her happy face and her excited mood, Elliott and I both agreed readily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sent my mother home first and wanted to cook with her. But then I got the call from Adam.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you free to come to the company now? We have some urgent things to discuss with you. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll be right there."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I had addressed Jade, a hidden danger, I didn't go to the Glory Group in the past two days. But I entrusted the Glory Group to my father's old subordinate, Isaac, who was in charge of handling matters.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I arrived at the Glory Group, Isaac, Adam, and Katrina were all waiting for me in my office. All of them looked solemn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" I had a premonition that something was not going well and asked quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac handed me a report and said, "Mrs. Bryant, take a look at this. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I received the report from Isaac and read it line by line. When I found the huge amount, I was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the total amount of loans we have borrowed from various banks in the past two years? Up to three billion dollars?" I looked at this number in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, this is the final data compiled by the Finance Department after counting all the accounts in the past few days. The past few years have witnessed how the Glory Group has proliferated superficially. But in fact, the profit of many projects does not meet the estimated goal. If such circumstances continue, I'm afraid we will owe more money to the bank. Once our capital chain is broken, the Glory Group will go bankrupt," Isaac said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept silent after hearing Isaac's report.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Glory Group worked like a ship, which sailed smoothly superficially. But in fact, it was full of hidden dangers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that my father was heavily in debt. Maybe these debts were caused by Jade's traps or by the higher loans of the Glory Group.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="342.html">« Prev</a><a href="344.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
