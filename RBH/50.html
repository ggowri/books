When she heard my voice, she visibly paused for a moment and then couldn't help but give me a quick once-over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, I was still wearing casual clothes, and on top of that, someone had just spilled champagne on my left shoulder. I looked ordinary and a bit disheveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a contemptuous smile on her face as she gracefully flicked her long hair in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wondering who it was. Mr. Bryant asked me to come early today. So, did Mr. Bryant not even prepare a tuxedo for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I noticed the dress she was wearing. It should be Valentino's autumn collection, not top-notch, but also not cheap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From her proud tone and expression, it seemed that Elliott was the one who paid for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott really spent our money at will. I didn't know what he liked about Sylvia. He actually was willing to spend money on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's none of your business whether I have a formal dress prepared or not. But if you come to my doorstep and act recklessly, then I have to intervene! Security, throw her out! I don't want to see this woman entering the door again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was too lazy to argue with her, so I directly spoke to the security guard standing nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although most of the people in the venue didn't know me, the security guard at the entrance had just witnessed me and Elliott arriving here together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I said this, the security guards immediately understood. They rushed forward and forcibly made Sylvia leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia certainly didn't expect me to do this. She was clearly furious, stomping her feet and shouting loudly in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? Why are you kicking me out? I have a VIP ticket, and moreover, I am Mr. Bryant's girlfriend. Who dares to kick me out? I will call him right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia really didn't care about her dignity. She knew very well that Elliott was married, yet she still publicly claimed to be his girlfriend. She really wasn't afraid of the entertainment reporters writing nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she was not afraid, but I was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was the big day for the Bryant Group, and as Elliott's wife, I couldn't let others talk nonsense and ruin the perfectly planned dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out. This woman is not allowed to enter the venue without my permission! Even if it's Mr. Bryant's words, it doesn't work. Did you hear me clearly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said coldly, exuding a natural and imposing aura all over my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"May I ask, who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security team leader approached me cautiously, nodding his head, and asked me carefully. It seemed that he still couldn't confirm my identity, so he wanted to double-check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you blind? She was Mrs. Bryant, the wife of Mr. Bryant. How dare anyone act wildly here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could speak, a clear tenor voice suddenly drifted in from outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately after, I saw Quinn walking in, dressed in a white suit, and he menacingly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security captain was startled immediately, and he quickly apologized to me. Then, he immediately gave orders to the security guards to drive Sylvia away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn walked up to me at this moment, and he clearly saw the champagne stain on my shoulder. Given what we just saw, he thought it was Sylvia who did it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, without asking me, he picked up a bottle of champagne from the side and walked over to Sylvia, pouring it directly over her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia was also a celebrity, and she had never experienced such a humiliating disgrace before. In an instant, she couldn't help but burst into loud sobs at the entrance of the venue.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="49.html">« Prev</a><a href="51.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
