I immediately said, "Okay, I will call him right away, wait a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately stood up, took out his phone, and walked out, then immediately called Dalton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Marcus left, I felt a sharp gaze sweep straight toward me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, I didn't look over there directly, but the gaze made me very uncomfortable. So, </span><span>I decided to lift my head and collided with his gaze face to face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat quietly in his place, he pursed his lips, swallowed, and then suddenly said, "I noticed that you were quite busy, having meals with so many people every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice wasn't loud, but because I was not far away, I still heard it clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I found you quite idle, bumping into you wherever I went," I retorted immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and wasn't angry, with a faint smile on his face. "This shows that our fate is not over yet, which is a good thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement really... inexplicably disgusts me, causing me to furrow my brows and involuntarily shake my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I found that the way you speak now is a bit disgusting," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you women just like this? It's just that I used to be bad at expressing myself." He seemed completely oblivious to the sarcasm in my words, and even felt a bit pleased with himself, thinking that he had made progress now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was speechless and couldn't help but roll my eyes. At that moment, Marcus had already turned back and he raised the phone in his hand, happily saying, "Madeline, Dalton was thrilled to hear this news. He said he will buy the earliest flight tomorrow and come over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great! I immediately said happily, "I will go to the airport with you tomorrow to pick him up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because I had memories from my past life, I had high expectations for this movie by Dalton. I had already foreseen that this movie would definitely have a high box office, so I had no worries at all and couldn't help but show a bright smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no matter how much I laughed, the coldness at that table could make me feel frozen and suffocated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of being stared at by others was truly uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My face became stiff all of a sudden, and when I looked over there, Elliott did not face my direction. He seemed relaxed, gentlemanly, and elegant, enjoying his meal as if he was savoring the delicious food in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why have you been looking over there all the time?" Marcus finally noticed something was amiss and instinctively turned his head, curiously taking a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he immediately caught on, and he visibly paused for a few seconds before turning his head to look at me, lowering his voice. "Elliott? What is he doing here for dinner too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shrugged helplessly. "I don't know. The chances of running into him lately have been so high that I even suspect it's his plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott must have heard my voice. As soon as I finished speaking, he suddenly stood up and walked toward us.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="696.html">« Prev</a><a href="698.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
