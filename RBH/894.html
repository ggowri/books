Without missing a beat, he directed Elliott to take me to the infirmary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy was a force to be reckoned with, and I was no match for her. The gash on my arm was deep. After the field medic had hastily bandaged it to stop the bleeding, he still recommended that I head to the hospital for a proper check-up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott paced back and forth in the medical office, seething with anger. Today's incident had him fuming. He barked at the golf course manager:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Outrageous! She dares to harm others right here! Send her to the police station immediately! No one is allowed to plead for her!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, the police just took her away. However, she seemed a bit off-kilter. She was babbling nonsense the whole time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golf course manager said with a hint of fear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Insane? Babbling nonsense?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay on the infirmary bed, my mind involuntarily replaying the twisted expression and eerie gaze of Lucy just before she lunged at me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've seen a similar expression on Elliott's face before, back when he was unconscious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Lucy, Lisa had brought her along specifically for today. The thought sent a shiver down my spine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Lisa darted into the medical office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she stepped in, fear was etched all over her face. Innocently, she asked Elliott,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, is Ms. Mayers okay? I didn't expect Lucy to be so impulsive as to do something like this. I brought her here, so I share the blame. I'm really sorry&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even spare me a glance, her eyes were just sadly fixed on Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was me who got hurt, why is she apologizing to Elliott?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lisa, why on earth did you bring Lucy here? And why is she carrying a knife?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glared at Lisa, his eyes still brimming with fury.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm as clueless as you are, mate. I've bumped into her a few times at parties, we hit it off and became friends. We were supposed to be here for a friendly round of golf today. I didn't expect to run into you guys here. As for why she's packing a blade, I'm in the dark as much as you are. I know it's all on me. I shouldn't have brought her here. I'm sorry, Ms. Mayers, are you feeling any better?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa cast a pitiful glance at Elliott. Only after she had spoken did she shift her gaze from his face, flicking a quick look in my direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Our eyes met, and I could sense no apology in her gaze. She was merely pretending to be sorry in front of Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, would you mind stepping out for a bit? I'd like to have a word with Ms. Fox alone."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I calmly regarded the woman before me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If everything that had happened before could still be chalked up to coincidence, then there was no way she could hide her intentions this time, no matter what.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm absolutely certain she's targeting me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, she was just targeting me in secret. But now, she's lost control, wanting others to hurt me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I let her carry on like this, I'll only find myself sinking deeper into a defensive position.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's time to lay my cards on the table with her, to see what her true intentions really are.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Ms. Mayers, what do you want to chat about?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa blinked at me, her eyes wide with fear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got something to tell you. Elliott, you need to leave."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instantly became serious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll be just outside. Holler if you need me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="893.html">« Prev</a><a href="895.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
