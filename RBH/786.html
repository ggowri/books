No matter what Elliott says or does now, I can't return to the way I once felt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at his sleeping face, I let out a soft sigh, sending a message for Barry to come in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's asleep, Barry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Barry walked in, I subtly pointed at Elliott and whispered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He can only fall asleep when you're there. Otherwise, he suffers through sleepless nights. It's agonizing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry let out a sigh of relief upon seeing Elliott sound asleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find a blanket and let him sleep here. I'm heading out, take good care of him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rose to my feet, addressing Barry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. Thanks, Mrs. Bryant."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry nodded, a hint of apology in his gaze as he met my eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking care of Elliott, I returned home only to be hit with a low-grade fever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom has always been worried about me not taking care of myself, always on the run. Now that she sees me with a cold, she insists that I must stay at home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To keep me from going out, my mom confiscated my phone, forbidding me to contact anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no choice but to comply, spending my days holed up in my bedroom, living a life of eat, sleep, repeat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my mom and dad around, there's no need for me to take care of Noah. Most of my days are spent lounging in bed, watching TV, with the occasional check-in on Noah.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't recall the last time I lived such a leisurely life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the divorce, my schedule was chock-full with work. I was always on the go, never willing to take a break, even from the time I was pregnant until I gave birth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I'm being forced by my mom to take a break. At first, I was restless, but as my mom kept bringing me delicious food, slowly, I let go of my worries. I began to enjoy this precious rest and vacation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half a month has passed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, after Marcus confirmed that my health was back on track, Mom gave me the green light to go outside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her constant reminders for me to rest and recuperate, I hit the ground running with work as soon as I got my hands on my phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry, Isaac, and Jane have each taken charge of their own domains now. They've tried their best not to bother me these past couple of weeks. But without my approval, many things in the company just can't move forward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making more than a dozen calls, I finally managed to sort out some pressing matters. Then, I vented and chatted in our trio's besties group chat. I scrolled through Instagram.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw Carole's post: Happy Birthday to my little bro.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it Quinn's birthday today?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly glanced at the date, today was Quinn's birthday.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All along, it's been Quinn taking care of me in every little detail, while I've done so little for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I made a special trip to a dessert shop I've always been fond of, spending the better part of the day baking a cake by hand. I then carefully placed the cake in a fancy box. I also made a point to visit Quinn's favorite trendy brand store, where I bought the latest pair of shoes and had them nicely wrapped. Carrying these items, I headed to Quinn's club.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've never celebrated Quinn's birthday before.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="785.html">« Prev</a><a href="787.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
