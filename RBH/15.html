Yet I was not sure if I could alter the course of Elliott and Giselle&#x27;s encounter.</p><p>It was said that people who were destined to meet would meet. If she was truly his soulmate, perhaps no matter how much I tried to prevent it, they would eventually fall in love.</p><p>As I thought about this, my already cold heart suddenly became even colder.</p><p>What was Giselle doing at this time?</p><p>At this point in time, I guessed she should have finished work and gone to help out at her mother&#x27;s flower shop.</p><p>Driven by curiosity, I impulsively drove to the flower shop that Toby had mentioned.</p><p>The name of the flower shop was very artistic. It was &quot;Encounter&quot;.</p><p>Just within a commercial area less than 550 yards away from the Bryant Group, there was a small flower shop, approximately 320 square feet in size. The decoration was average. What set it apart was that it was filled with flowers inside and various potted plants outside, making it look full, lively, and artistic.</p><p>I stepped into the flower shop and saw a woman in her forties or fifties. She was wearing a floral dress, trimming the fresh flowers.</p><p>Her face resembled Giselle&#x27;s to some extent, and she also looked somewhat like Toby. Presumably, she was Nicole Santos, their mother.</p><p>Nicole heard the noise at the door and immediately warmly welcomed me.</p><p>She said, &quot;Hello, miss, do you want to buy flowers?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Go on with your work. I&#x27;ll just take a look for myself.&quot;</p><p>I looked around this small flower shop and found that although it was small, it was well-maintained. On the flower shelves, there were not only flowers but also some artistic trinkets. And on the small blackboard of the flower shop, there were several lines of elegant calligraphy.</p><p>Maybe this calligraphy was written by Giselle with chalk.</p><p>I was quietly admiring it when suddenly, a small ornament next to the blackboard caught my attention.</p><p>It was a small plaster statue, depicting a fifteen or sixteen-year-old boy holding the hand of a little girl who appeared to be around six or seven years old. The ground beneath their feet seemed to be muddy.</p><p>I had seen this plaster statue on Elliott&#x27;s desk in my previous life.</p><p>At that time, out of curiosity, I picked it up and took a look. As a result, Elliott immediately snatched it from my hand and loudly scolded me, blaming me for casually touching his thing.</p><p>Originally, this plaster statue was a gift from Giselle to him. No wonder it seemed even more precious in his eyes than other priceless antiques.</p><p>As I thought about it, bitterness suddenly welled up in my heart. Subconsciously, I reached out to take down the plaster statue. Surprisingly, at that moment, a clear and sweet female voice came from the door.</p><p>&quot;Miss, I&#x27;m sorry, but we won&#x27;t sell it.&quot;</p><p>I instinctively pulled back my hand, turned around, and saw Giselle standing at the entrance of the flower shop with a handsome boy who was about half a head taller than her.</p><p>Giselle was still wearing the professional attire that I saw her in on the seventh floor of the Bryant Group Building last time. The boy next to her was wearing a polo shirt and black pants. Both of them had a hint of youthful inexperience on their faces, but they were indeed a perfect match.</p><p>It seemed that this boy was probably Giselle&#x27;s boyfriend whom Toby mentioned. Toby said they were about to get married.</p><p>So as I expected, Giselle really came here after work.</p><p>At this time in my previous life, we were still strangers, so I couldn&#x27;t help but be curious about her past.</p><p>I smiled slightly and said, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. I just felt it was familiar and wanted to take it off for a look.&quot;</p><p>I quietly observed Giselle. She was as slim as me, with skin even fairer than mine. Her big eyes looked pure and dreamy. The determination and tenacity in her gaze were beyond her age, adding a touch of charm to her entire face.</p><p>&quot;Okay, except for that one, you can look at anything else.&quot;</p><p>Giselle spoke lightly, her face showing a hint of annoyance. She looked somewhat unhappy.</p><p>At that moment, the boy grabbed Giselle&#x27;s arm and spoke, his tone carrying a hint of pleading.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Giselle, don&#x27;t be angry. It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t work well. It&#x27;s just that even though I tried hard, it was useless. I took more than ten people to see houses a few days ago, but these people were so picky that in the end, they didn&#x27;t rent the houses. It was just a waste of effort.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;If doing business were so easy, wouldn&#x27;t everyone be making millions? As long as you&#x27;re willing to work hard, out of all those potential clients, there will always be someone willing to make a deal. If you keep playing games every day like this, when will we be able to afford a house? Do you even want to get married, or is it that you don&#x27;t care about me at all?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Giselle seemed to have a lot of anger pent up inside her. She yelled at the boy, her face turning bright red as she crossed her arms. Clearly, his lack of ambition had deeply saddened her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Actually, she didn&#x27;t have to be sad. Soon, she could successfully hook up with Elliott. Not to mention a house, if Elliott was willing, he could easily buy an entire building for her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;How can I not care about you? It&#x27;s just that the house prices in Hoswich City are so high. I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to afford a house in my lifetime. Giselle, why don&#x27;t you and your mom come back to my hometown with me? Although my hometown is a third-tier city, my family has a house, and I can also get a good job there...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The boy clearly did not have ambitious aspirations to get ahead in this city. He tried to persuade Giselle, but she angrily interrupted him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Rowan, do you know that? What I hate the most is hearing you say that you want to go back to your hometown. If you want to go back, you can go anytime, even now. Just go. I don&#x27;t want to see you anymore.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After Giselle finished speaking, she furiously pushed the boy out of the flower shop and then directly closed the glass door.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The boy stood at the door, looking at her with sadness and helplessness. After standing for a while, he angrily walked away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Giselle stood at the door with her hands crossed, watching the boy leave. Her eyes immediately turned red, indicating that she cared about this boy named Rowan.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It is normal for a man at this age to lack ambition and be more interested in playing. Why do you have to force him?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Nicole saw that Giselle was sad, so she walked over and comforted Giselle.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mom, Rowan is like this. When will we be able to afford a house in Hoswich City? I&#x27;m tired of renting a house everywhere. I don&#x27;t care. If he doesn&#x27;t work harder, I will break up with him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Giselle spoke with a huff.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I quietly observed this slender girl. Although young, she had a competitive stubbornness deep within her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wiped away the tears from her face, looking so pitiful. I was sure men, especially successful men, would be attracted to her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Elliott turned out to like this kind of indomitable girl.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I pondered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At this moment, Nicole softly said, &quot;I advised you long ago to break up if he was suitable for you. Even if you date a local person in Hoswich City, at least you won&#x27;t have to worry about buying a house. Maybe he can even help Toby. Yet you didn&#x27;t listen to me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">I thought Nicole would ask Giselle to make up with her boyfriend. However, unexpectedly, this seemingly gentle woman turned out to be much more realistic than I had imagined.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At this point, Giselle had already wiped away her tears. She glanced at me, probably noticing that I was looking at her, and then she tugged at Nicole&#x27;s sleeve and whispered softly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mom, there is still a customer in the shop. Let&#x27;s talk about this later. I have made an appointment with Evan from my company. I want him to come and see the flowers here. My company plans to purchase fresh flowers to decorate the office in the long term. This is a big order for us, and we need to find a way to win this business.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="14.html">« Prev</a><a href="16.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
