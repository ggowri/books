If the medicine works, he should start sweating soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following his instructions, I grabbed another pillow and placed it under Elliott's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to leave, Elliott suddenly grasped my hand and hoarsely pleaded, "Don't go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not leaving. I'll be sitting right across from you." I gestured to the sofa opposite, reassuring him softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after hearing my words did Elliott release my hand. He was visibly exhausted as he closed his eyes and drifted back into a slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus predicted, soon enough, beads of sweat began forming on Elliott's forehead, followed by a profusion on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed the medicine was truly effective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Elliott continued sweating, his high fever would gradually subside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a surge of joy witnessing this progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, he's sweating. Looks like the medicine is working wonders!" I exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, his constitution is strong. Targeted treatment is key. Once the fever subsides, he should be in the clear!" Marcus replied, relieved and smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's fantastic! We don't need to test on anyone else. We can confidently produce this medicine in bulk. It could benefit many patients!" I expressed my delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Mr. Bryant knew we used him as a guinea pig, I wonder if he'd blame us when he wakes up," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Elliott's complexion gradually regain color, and his lips regain their rosy hue, I couldn't help but speak up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is actually his good fortune. He's lucky to have met you tonight. Otherwise, he would have suffered from this virus for much longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Marcus and I barely slept as we tended to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he sweated profusely, his clothes were drenched. Marcus fetched a set of casual clothes, and together, we wiped his body and changed his attire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After rechecking Elliott's temperature, Marcus confirmed his fever had subsided. Clearly more comfortable, Elliott finally drifted into a peaceful sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted from the night's events, I initially sat by his side but eventually succumbed to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon waking up, I found myself nestled in Elliott's embrace. As I stirred, he immediately opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you awake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice was still hoarse but noticeably improved from the previous night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, I quickly extricated myself from his embrace and rubbed my eyes, asking, "How did I fall asleep? Are you feeling better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm much better. My body doesn't feel as heavy anymore," Elliott replied before sitting up effortlessly on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared rejuvenated, no longer the sickly figure from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing around and then down at his clothes, Elliott seemed about to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Marcus entered the room with a tray from the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, you seem to be doing much better. Perfect timing, I've made some cereal. Both you and Madeline should eat something."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="480.html">« Prev</a><a href="482.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
