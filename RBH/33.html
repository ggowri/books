Afterward, he sat down and helped me up from the bed. Before I could say anything, he quickly checked my body and, after confirming that I was not injured, he breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, he considerately pulled a towel and covered it over my chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you not injured? Fortunately, fortunately, we arrived just in time. It's really fortunate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to my previous life, Quinn has truly changed completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, his words of concern and caring gaze seemed so genuine, to the extent that I could feel his body slightly trembling due to excessive nervousness about my safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was fine, how come you appeared here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I weakly said, my head still feeling a bit dizzy. The heat inside me made me unable to resist reaching out for Quinn's arm, and my gaze became somewhat hazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was startled and quickly realized that something was not right with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did they drug you? Come on, I'll take you to the hospital! Are you wondering why I'm here? Last night, Paige and I were drinking together, and she told me about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn explained while quickly grabbing me and heading out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys keep an eye on these two individuals! You must make them confess the mastermind behind the scenes. I won't spare them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn turned his head and shouted angrily at the several bodyguards in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened to Madeline?
