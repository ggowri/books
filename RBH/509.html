I wanted to do something for Quinn, but I found I was too anxious when I arrived and had nothing prepared except for a few boxes of masks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Quinn to be injured, so I didn't buy any fruits or nutritional supplements. At this moment, looking at his haggard and injured look, I couldn't help but shed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Quinn saw that I was silent and cried, he immediately panicked and took out a tissue to wipe my tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry. I'm fine. It's not that serious. When I was talking to you on the phone, some gangsters were making trouble in the hospital, and I went up to try to stop them, but one of them cut my abdomen with a knife. It's a minor injury, and there is no internal damage. No crying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn comforted me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened to your head?" I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A few of them rushed up. I was outnumbered and was beaten. See, I'm still sober, so my head must be fine. Don't worry. I'll rest for two or three days, and then I'll be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn continued comforting me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typical Quinn. No matter how big the matter was, he always didn't take it seriously. He was obviously injured, but he acted like everything was fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did I stop crying. I raised my head and looked at him with red eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really fine? You didn't lie to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. How about I get out of bed, walk around, and dance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I didn't believe him, he moved to get out of bed. I was frightened and quickly pressed his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, stop messing around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked very nervous, which made Quinn laugh. He looked at me meaningfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect you to feel so sad. If I had known, I should have let them give me more stabs to make myself more miserable. If so, would you faint from crying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was optimistic by nature and could make fun of anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was speechless and glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No more jokes. Do you have anything you want to eat? I'll buy it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn pointed to a bag of fruit on the table not far away and smiled, "Since you're so sincere, can you peel an apple for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further ado, I walked over and took out an apple, washed it, and then carefully peeled it with a paring knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was also injured on his head, and it would be difficult for him to bite such a big apple. So, I cut it into pieces and put them in a plate. Then, I added some yogurt to the plate and brought it to his bed with a fork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your hand is injured, too. Don't move, and I'll feed you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just wanted to do something for him and didn't give it much thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I never expected that when I forked a piece of apple and handed it to Quinn's mouth, he gazed at me with tears in his eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="508.html">« Prev</a><a href="510.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
