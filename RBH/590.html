"Elliott, I heard that Made..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had obviously rushed over upon hearing the commotion, but upon entering and seeing the chaos, Giselle stopped mid-sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The office was in disarray, with papers and trinkets scattered on Elliott's desk from our recent struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My hair and clothes were disheveled, and I was holding onto the ashtray, while Elliott's once immaculate suit now bore visible creases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any discerning eye could easily guess what had just transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle strode quickly towards me, grabbing my clothes and shouting loudly, "Madeline, you're already divorced from Elliott, so why are you here harassing him? What are your intentions? I'm about to give birth, and you still won't give up. How long do you plan on tormenting us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle displayed an accusatory demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt ironic to be questioned by the woman who had once openly disrupted our relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave her a cold glance and decisively broke free from her grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, your theatrics have gone on long enough! Wait for your child to be born healthy and then continue your drama!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was taken aback, her voice growing sharper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what do you mean by that? Are you cursing my unborn child? I never expected you to be so malicious, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Elliott finally reached his breaking point, roaring in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle turned to him in panic, her demeanor shifting to one of timidity, her voice softening. "Elliott, she cursed our child to be unhealthy. Isn't that too much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out," Elliott pointed to the door, shouting at Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the next moment, Giselle, right in front of me, rushed towards Elliott and threw herself into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, why are you treating me like this again? Didn't you promise to treat me and our child well? Why do you act cold towards me every time you're in front of Madeline? We're not like this in private..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Giselle spoke, she kept glancing at me, seemingly observing my reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I had already seen through her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "She is simply trying to convey that Elliott is intentionally distant towards her in front of me but treats her well in private.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ha, as if that matters at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does she think these petty tricks could still hurt my heart like they used to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She is mistaken. I can't care less."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, visibly flustered by her words, forcefully pushed her away, simultaneously shouting coldly, "Giselle, shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle stumbled backward, and in the process, her stomach hit the corner of the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, she let out an incredibly sharp scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, my... my stomach!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden turn of events shocked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched in disbelief as sweat poured down Giselle's forehead, her face contorted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop pretending, get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott thought Giselle was acting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next moment, I actually saw a mixture of blood and amniotic fluid flowing from Giselle's thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned, my mind thrown into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I think my water just broke! This isn't good, I might be going into labor early!" Giselle cried out in agony.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="589.html">« Prev</a><a href="591.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
