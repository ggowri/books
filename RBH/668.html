They even knew more than me about what happened to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already awkward to attend a gathering at the Bryant's residence, and their flattery made me even more embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively wanted to find Quinn, but I discovered that Quinn had already been pulled to another table by Benjamin, and Grey was completely unaware of my embarrassment. Hearing everyone's flattery, she arrogantly raised an eyebrow and then deliberately lowered her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "That's not true. The Bryant family didn't cherish Madeline, but we treated Madeline like a treasure. Quinn's parents said that although the Woods family is low-key, as long as Madeline likes it, we will definitely hold a luxurious wedding ceremony to let everyone know that Madeline has become a member of our family. </span><span>However, it's not appropriate to talk about these things on this occasion. Let's talk about something else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if intentionally trying to support me, Grey deliberately spoke these words in public, and then stopped discussing the topic due to the occasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as these noble ladies heard the gossip, they completely disregarded the occasion and began relentlessly questioning...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they getting married? Really? When are Quinn and Madeline planning to have their wedding? You must let us know..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, so you guys really had two good things happen at the same time, huh? Madeline must be about six or seven months pregnant now. Did she go to the hospital for a check-up? Is it a boy or a girl?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They started talking about me again. I nervously watched these excited women, feeling like I was surrounded by a flock of ducks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I was feeling more and more embarrassed, Grey said something that made me even more embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, she went. Of course, it was a boy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Grey uttered these words, Laura, who was originally toasting at the next table, rushed over as if she had heard some extraordinary news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could react, she unexpectedly grabbed my shoulder, her eyes filled with uncontrollable joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, were you carrying a boy? Is this true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's sudden action caught me off guard and left me stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had told her countless times that my unborn child had nothing to do with the Bryant family. Unexpectedly, she heard this fabricated news from Grey and still got so excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Laura Bryant, the gender of Madeline's child has nothing to do with your family, the Bryant family. Why are you so excited?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey was very unhappy with Laura's exaggerated reaction. She frowned and said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The child hasn't been born yet, so we have to wait until it is born to know for sure if there is a connection with the Bryant family. Madeline, are you really carrying a boy? If so, that's really great. Last night, I had a dream that Cormac said the Bryant family has descendants. I never expected to hear such good news today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Laura finished speaking, she affectionately took my hand, as if there had never been any grievances between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had seen people without boundaries, but I had never seen someone so outrageous. Looking at her like this, I felt my scalp was literally tingling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, what do you mean by that? You are accusing Madeline. I advise you not to say such things again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey became even unhappy when she heard that. She immediately retorted.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="667.html">« Prev</a><a href="669.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
