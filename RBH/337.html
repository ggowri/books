Do you still have time for romance?" I was stunned and couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed again and pinched my nose lovingly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm angry, so I have to vent out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled evilly, but suddenly he made a turn to pin me down. His hands started stroking on my body again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Again?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could not believe that he was so energetic. I couldn't help but roll my eyes and subconsciously wanted to shred him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I had nowhere to escape in such a cramped space. I felt like I was like a little white rabbit, which could be easily caught or trapped by hunters.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could imagine this scene?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just one night, but so many episodes have happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He worked tirelessly on my body again and again. Finally, both of us were exhausted. We were wrapped in blankets, stayed in the car, and fell asleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never thought I would sleep on the side of a highway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never thought that people could be so crazy and so free.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so exhausted that I fell into a deep sleep. It wasn't until the first ray of sunlight coming through the car window in the morning that I opened my eyes uncomfortably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My whole body was completely limp and I even felt as if I had lost the strength to get up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was lying in the car and found Elliott had already got up. He stood outside the car, holding the railing with both hands. Behind his tall body was the sea. The morning sun in the distance rose slowly on the horizon, and the glow made his figure look more majestic and taller.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he get up so early after struggling all night?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously struggled to get up, but my sore arms reminded me that I was a little weak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I just lay in the car and enjoyed the sunrise and the sea.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but take out my mobile phone to take a photo of Elliott and the red sun.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The messages on the phone popped up one after another.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing all these messages, I found that Quinn had been looking for me and he didn't sleep all night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He worried that Elliott would embarrass me, so he sent me a message every hour to ask me what I was doing and requested me to reply to him as soon as I got his messages.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could tell how he worried about me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the messages from him at six o'clock in the morning, I couldn't help but feel very guilty. So I quickly replied to him: [Don't worry, I'm fine.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn replied to my message in the next second. He obviously hadn't slept.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[It's good that you finally responded to my message. It was terrible when that guy went crazy. Did he embarrass you?]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, it was terrible for Elliott to get crazy...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the crazy scene we had last night was completely different from the one I would have expected.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I thought about what we had done last night, my cheeks instantly got hot. I had such a strong sense of shame that I didn't know how to respond to Quinn's messages.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, in the chat group of three of my best friends, Paige sent a message.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[I was bleeding, and my stomach pained this morning. What's going on with me? I'm not going to have a miscarriage, am I?]</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="336.html">« Prev</a><a href="338.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
