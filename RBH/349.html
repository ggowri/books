Lily noticed the hickeys on my neck, causing a wave of shame to wash over me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Elliott was really bad."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I lay in the bath, my mind was filled with the vivid memory of his kiss and the way he held me. I flushed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could not help but relive those moments.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was obsessed with Elliott's handsome face and hot body. His magnetic voice even echoed in my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every moment with him replayed in my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the bathroom door swung open when I immersed myself in my fantasy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nearly leaped out of the tub in shock. There, Elliott stood with only underwear. He proudly showed me his body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? I'm taking a shower! Get out!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My already flushed face instantly became even hotter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wished to push him out, but I was naked in the bathtub. If I stood up, I would reveal my body to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are already married. Why are you shy?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't take my embarrassment seriously. He seemed to enjoy teasing me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew I was ashamed, but he kneeled to stare at me with a mischievous grin. He even reached out to scoop up the bubbles in the bathtub and rubbed them on my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so shy that I was at a loss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I covered my flushed cheeks with both hands. My heart pounded in my chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, his hot hands slid through the water to caress my body wantonly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, I heard his charmingly magnetic voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You once penned your intimate fantasies in your diary that you wanted me to help you bathe. You also mentioned that despite your slender figure, your boobs were big, and you yearned for me to explore your body."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of them were just a sexual fantasy from my teenage years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been so long that I had forgotten those slutty words in my diary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so ashamed. But Elliott had already caught my legs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lunged to grasp his hand, but my clumsy attempt only resulted in a miniature tidal wave in the bathtub.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've remembered all your fantasies. From now on, I'll satisfy you one by one."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face suddenly drew near.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened my eyes and instinctively trembled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand caressed my lips. His desire to have sex with me was evident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, stop it. You'll be tired of having sex every day."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I struggled to resist and pushed him away, but my hands seemed paralyzed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not tired. So are you. I will take the lead."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His boundless energy brought him to kiss me passionately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I surrendered to his temptation and behaved like a puppet to immerse in his kiss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything that followed was like a dream!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind went blank as Elliott led me to immerse in the fantastic sex.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="348.html">« Prev</a><a href="350.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
