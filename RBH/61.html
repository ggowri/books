Then, he picked up one of the glasses of champagne and handed it to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mood tonight, indeed had an indescribable... bitterness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I picked up the glass and without hesitation, I tilted my head back and drank it all in one gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This champagne is truly a rare find from the auction. Its taste is indeed good. It drinks sweetly. Its flavor is delicious and authentic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished a glass, I poured another one. Immediately, I drank it all in one go. When I was about to pour the third glass, Quinn quickly stopped me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drink slowly. Although this wine is sweet, it is easy to get drunk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, were you reluctant to let me have a drink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at him. I knew very well that he didn't mean it, but I still deliberately said it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn instantly let go of my hand. He pointed to the rows of expensive wines in the cabinet behind him, his face full of smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I don't have much else here, but the most I have is alcohol. Tonight, as long as you want to drink, you can drink as much as you like. I'll accompany you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, on the other hand, was also generous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say much anymore. He just accompanied me, drinking glass after glass of alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, I became a little drunk. This floating feeling intoxicated me. No wonder many people like to drink when they are in a bad mood. It turns out that alcohol really can temporarily make people forget about their unhappiness and depression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, as the club owner, lived up to his reputation. He was very skilled at playing drinking games.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He taught me how to play a drinking game. Afterward, he brought out dice to play a points game with me. He tried his best to make me laugh heartily. Unknowingly, I drank a lot of alcohol. I was completely drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, what did you say Giselle had going for her? Why did Elliott like her so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, who did you say Elliott liked?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I am clearly not inferior to her in any way. Why does Elliott never pay attention to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you said in this world, is it possible that there are some loves that I am destined to never have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, do you think Elliott would love Giselle to the extent of being willing to sacrifice his life, just like before? Would he love her to the point of completely disregard</span><span>ing</span><span> everything else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gradually drank too much. Even though I was asking Quinn, I seemed more like muttering to myself. I no longer knew what I was saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When people are feeling upset, tears seem to come out of nowhere. I clearly told myself not to be sad for Elliott anymore. However, my tears couldn't help but surge out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the painful memories from the previous life, like fragments, cruelly inserted into my heart. I was in so much pain that my heart felt like it was bleeding. I was almost suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what do you mean by that? How did you know what Elliott was like before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn supported my shoulders. He loudly asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really wanted to answer him. But at that moment, my brain was foggy. I was swaying all over. And in front of me, Quinn suddenly had several more faces. But I couldn't see any of them clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I wanted to go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stumbled towards the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were already drunk. Come, I'll carry you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's warm large hand grabbed my wrist. Immediately, he crouched in front of me. Soon, I felt like I was swinging on a swing, swaying back and forth on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My stomach was very uncomfortable. I felt an indescribable discomfort. I had no strength at all. I just let him carry me forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard my phone ringing continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when I picked up my phone and saw the name "Elliott," I didn't want to answer the call at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I forcefully threw my phone away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phone fell onto the floor and made a loud "thud" sound.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="60.html">« Prev</a><a href="62.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
