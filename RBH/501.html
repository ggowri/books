We walked in the door and saw a dessert shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the pandemic, only a few people were shopping, and there were no customers in the dessert shop. Adam found a seat for me and then went to order food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, the waiter brought desserts, and they all looked nice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, try it. These are the signatures," Adam smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up the spoon and took a bite of Tiramisu. It tasted good, with a proper sweetness. It lightened my mood instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was really kind. While eating desserts, he told me jokes to cheer me up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were very contagious, coupled with his rich and exaggerated body language, so his jokes cracked me up. Even the girl at the table beside us couldn't help but laugh at his jokes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it. You're killing me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I doubled up and tried to stop laughing, but I couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it funny? I have a lot of jokes. Madeline, I will tell you a joke every day from now on so that you can be cheerful until you give birth. If you are happy, the baby will be happy," Adam said and laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heartwarming words gradually got rid of my sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe people's appetites could be increased instantly when they were in a good mood. I ate two desserts and was full.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the dessert, we walked out of the dessert shop and saw a maternal and child store opposite. My mother's instinct was immediately triggered, so I proposed to Adam to go there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My baby was less than three months old. Besides, I had never paid attention to maternity and baby stores before. However, probably because of my pregnancy, as soon as I saw the clothes and toys in the store, I couldn't help but want to go in and take a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam walked in with me. I was immediately attracted by a small, light blue jumpsuit hanging on the shelf. There was also a lovely little bear on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stepped forward subconsciously. Unexpectedly, as soon as I rounded the corner, I heard a familiar male voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's too early to buy these now. These are enough. I have to go back to the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this voice, I was stunned. I raised my head subconsciously. People always met someone they didn't want to meet. I saw Elliott and Giselle selecting maternal and child products together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nanny next to Giselle was pushing a stroller. I saw it was filled with various toys, maternal and baby supplies, and many children's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had her back to me. She didn't realize that I was there at all. She pouted at Elliott and said, "But Mary said, when the baby is born, we will need a lot of things, so I want to buy more. Elliott, don't you think these baby clothes are lovely?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe Giselle felt like no one was around. She acted very cutely, and her soft voice made my scalp feel numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at them quietly, feeling sad. Elliott was facing me, and he was about to say something when he accidentally saw me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he was so shocked that a baby rattle he was holding fell to the ground uncontrollably, making an extremely clear sound.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="500.html">« Prev</a><a href="502.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
