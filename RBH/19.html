He always let me do whatever I wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin, it's Madeline's first day at work, and she knows nothing about video production. I'm afraid she will feel bored sitting there and won't understand what we are talking about. How about I ask my assistant to take her around the Glory Group so that she can familiarize her with each department first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade tried her best to prevent Madeline from getting into the business. No one knew what was really on her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything becomes familiar after experiencing it once, and one will never learn anything if they don't participate. When you first joined the Glory Group, you also didn't know anything. At that time, Austin used to say that you were even dumber than a pig."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't care about what Jade thought. After retorting her, I held Austin's arm and walked into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade had no choice but to follow along, but I could see that there was no smile on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I accompanied Austin into the conference room and sat right next to him, whereas in the past, this position belonged to Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw me take the seat, so she had to sit on the other side of Austin reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the executives of the Glory Group had already gathered, and when they saw me entering the conference room, they looked at each other in dismay. But no one dared to say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meeting soon began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meeting focused mainly on the discussion of two video projects, Allure and Do Not Love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this is also the first time the Glory Group has ventured into the video industry since its transformation from an industrial corporation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the two projects gave presentations for their respective projects. As they spoke, my memories from my previous life gradually awakened...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my memory, in my previous life, the Glory Group chose Allure because it was the Glory Group's first foray into the video industry. They wanted to use this drama to break into the market, so they spared no expense in its production.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The early investment in Allure was enormous, with world-renowned directors and actors involved. Its promotion was overwhelming, with a huge amount of money invested in advertising alone. However, after the film was released, the audience measurement plummeted, causing a huge loss to the Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Do Not Love was a drama that was purchased by the Bryant Group. Elliott was not interested in the video market. His purpose in investing in this drama was just to promote Sylvia as the female lead. This drama was just a small production with a small budget, and even the director and actors were newcomers, with only Sylvia having a little bit of fame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's surprise, this drama turned out to be a hit. It had excellent production quality and a good storyline, and when it was finally released, it suddenly became popular. Not only did it bring fame to the director and actors of this drama, but it also made Elliott extremely wealthy, and he was hailed as a genius as an investor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, the Glory Group suffered heavy losses from Allure, and it caused a shock among the shareholders and senior management in the Glory Group. Since then, people had begun to question Austin's management ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those memories came back to my mind, and I began to contemplate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the two project leaders finished their presentations. After they finished, Jade stood up and made a summary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Based on the presentations just made by the two leaders, I personally prefer the drama, Allure. Recently, this type of theme has been very popular in the market, and many young people also enjoy it. Moreover, the character design of the male and female protagonists in the drama is good, and the plot is also very innovative. On the other hand, Do Not Love is mainly about small love stories, although the plot is easy to understand, I feel that its connotation is not deep enough, and the structure is also average. I estimate that the market response to it will be mediocre. What do you all think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade, relying on her several years of work experience, spoke incessantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, I saw several executives nodding in agreement and expressing that Allure was more worth investing in. Although the other executives did not express their opinions, according to the principle of majority rule, if I didn't speak up to stop it, it was likely to be finalized and there would be no room for turning back.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="18.html">« Prev</a><a href="20.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
