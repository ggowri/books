Don't tell me that the child in your belly belongs to my husband! If this is the case, you must explain it clearly to me today! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly became excited too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the grievances that had been accumulated in my heart for the past few days burst out at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more depressed Giselle was, the happier I was. I must make everything she has done during this time to the public tonight, and let her be laughed at by everyone in Hoswich just like I did in my last life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if she had just realized that she was too emotional, with more and more people surrounding her, Giselle subconsciously wanted to deny it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't say that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, I had let go of Laura's hands, rushed to Giselle, and grabbed her collar directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what is the truth you just said? If there is nothing wrong with the child in your belly, you can openly tell everyone who is the father of this baby. Why are you so hesitant? Laura, is there something you and Giselle are hiding from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended to be a victim and questioned them loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if she wanted to help me, the lady just now said loudly, "I just heard it. Mrs. Laura Bryant introduced Giselle to us as Elliott's wife. Moreover, I happened to see Mrs. Laura Bryant accompanying this lady to buy maternal and child products in the mall. Mrs. Laura Bryant, Glory Group's funding of Bryant Group was well known to the entire upper class. Although Bryant Group is now ranked number one in Hoswich, you shouldn't be ungrateful and bully Mr. Austin Mayers' daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the lady finished speaking, several other ladies immediately echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, you shouldn't be ungrateful. If Glory Group hadn't helped back then, Bryant Group might have gone bankrupt during the economic crisis."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, you can't do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Glory Group had not been a first-class company in Hoswich over the years, my parents were kind, so their reputation had always been good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone here supported me. Laura felt increasingly awkward. She stood there and was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, she finally said, "Madeline, don't think too much. Giselle's child is not Elliott's. I said I like her very much, but I won't regard her as my daughter-in-law."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, under strong pressure, Laura dared not to admit the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Laura, please don't lie to me. Everyone has heard it. This child has nothing to do with Elliot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was still holding on to Giselle's collar and deliberately said loudly.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="454.html">« Prev</a><a href="456.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
