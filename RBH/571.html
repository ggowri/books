As she had just married, she didn't have a formal career, but being a full-time homemaker, she was promptly dismissed during the group photo for not meeting the criteria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was still angry when she mentioned that party, and she hadn't attended similar events since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew it was the most exclusive and luxurious party organized by the elite socialites and wealthy women of Hoswich. Yet, anyone who could participate gained extremely high social status and access to more connections and resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, countless socialites and wealthy women took pride in entering that circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being single and carefree now, I was willing to try any form of socializing. So, I readily agreed, "Sure, I'm free tonight. But, Auntie Grey, should I prepare a stunning outfit for such a party?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely. Do you have a formal gown at home? If not, I'll go with you to buy one now. Also, I can lend you my latest Hermes bag. You won't find it in stores right now. I had to wait a long time to get it. Hermes is a must-have for every socialite." As Grey spoke, she quickly made arrangements for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt like the Woods family, and I were destined to be close. Regardless of which member of their family I was talking to, I felt completely at ease with them. It was as if we had known each other for a long time without any sense of formality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey took me directly to a high-end bespoke shop. With her guidance, I chose a silver sleeveless gown adorned with delicate rhinestones, shimmering like the Milky Way under the lights. The unique waist design accentuated my curves, and the hollow back design showcased clever craftsmanship. Such attire was both noble and elegant yet subtly sexy, perfectly suiting my current status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After selecting the gown, Grey promptly took me to her grand villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I entered, I was amazed by the entire wall of Hermes items. She fetched a white Hermes bag from the closet for me and then chose a magenta one for herself. She swapped her outfit for a sexy black dress. After touching up each other's makeup, we hopped into her Lincoln limousine and headed straight to the Elsa yacht on the Hoswich coastline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elsa yacht was a lavishly crafted vessel, undoubtedly one of the country's most luxurious and top-tier yachts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Grey was a leading figure among these socialites and wealthy women, as soon as we arrived on the deck, people promptly approached us, ushering us into the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were quickly led to a top-tier luxurious banquet hall, and as soon as Grey appeared, many socialites and wealthy women flocked to us, surrounding us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come, let me introduce you. This is Madeline, the heiress of the Glory Group and its current CEO. She's my nephew's girlfriend, and I've brought her here today to meet everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know her. I've seen her speech. It was truly inspiring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is she the Madeline from the recent Lotus Forum? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here today. What an honor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, why haven't you joined our parties before? We've been hoping you'd join us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enthusiasm of these socialites and wealthy women had completely exceeded my expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had come here out of curiosity, wanting to see what these parties were all about, but to my surprise, I immediately became the center of everyone's attention even before Grey finished introducing me. All because of that speech, which unexpectedly sparked intense curiosity among them.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="570.html">« Prev</a><a href="572.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
