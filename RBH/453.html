I am Elliott's wife. Nice to meet you all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Laura could react, I introduced myself to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing my words, all the ladies present were stunned. They looked at Giselle and me, and then they seemed to have understood something and looked thoughtful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I remembered that I once saw her at Bryant Group's mid-year party. Laura, you are so lucky. This lady is young and beautiful, and she is a perfect match for your son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I also remembered it. Your piano performance last time was wonderful. I remember Elliott's wife was the daughter of Mr. Austin Mayers, right? When Bryant Group encountered an economic crisis, Glory Group funded two billion dollars to help Bryant Group get through the crisis. My husband often mentioned that Bryant Group would not have made so many achievements now without Glory Group's help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I heard that Mr. Austin Mayers was ill some time ago. Is he fine now? Have you taken over Glory Group now? The recent TV series Do Not Love seems to have been invested by Glory Group. I think it is good, so I have been watching it recently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Do Not Love was popular recently, several ladies were friendly to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was how the upper class worked. Everyone was snobbish. Compared to Giselle, who was unknown, I was more favored by them as Austin's only daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kept praising me for being young and capable of working and said that both my background and appearance were outstanding. They think I am a perfect match for Elliott. They all unconsciously laughed at Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's expression changed again and again. In the end, she could only echo them and no longer dared to claim that Giselle was Elliott's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle stood there with a gloomy face. She kept silent and was very embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared with me, she had become an unknown clown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood for a while and felt embarrassed, so she whispered to Laura that she felt tired and wanted to take a rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would not give up the chance of humiliating her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stopped her directly and showed a fake smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, why did your belly suddenly become bigger? I have never heard that you are married, so why are you pregnant suddenly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked knowingly just to embarrass her in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, my words made her even more embarrassed. She blushed but couldn't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I was embarrassing Giselle on purpose, Laura looked grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, that's enough. Giselle is tired. I will take her to rest first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, you care about Giselle so much, is it because you know who the father of the baby is in her belly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew Laura didn't want me to expose this, but I still asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what do you want to do? There are so many people here, can you be polite?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being unable to explain it clearly, Laura yelled at me in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These ladies were very smart and had experienced many great events, so they had already noticed the problem between the three of us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone deliberately said, "Laura, why are you so angry all of a sudden? I remember clearly that before Madeline showed up, you said Giselle was Elliott's wife. What's going on now? We all remember that the one who married Elliott was Mr. Austin Mayers' daughter!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="452.html">« Prev</a><a href="454.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
