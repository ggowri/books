Are you really pregnant? Is it the child of the CEO of Bryant Group?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, my goodness, I'm so excited. I feel like I'm going to cry!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, tell us the truth. Is the child you're carrying Elliott's? I'm so happy for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were clearly shocked by Giselle's words and began bombarding her with questions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't take my eyes off Giselle, observing every subtle expression on her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed genuinely ecstatic. With their compliments, her joy turned into pride. Giselle couldn't help but instinctively touch her abdomen...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her joy of soon becoming a mother didn't seem fake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, her following words hit me like a thunderbolt, leaving me unable to come to my senses for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I am really pregnant, then whose child could it be other than Elliott's?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence felt like a sharp knife stabbing directly into my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart felt like it was torn open, bleeding profusely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Was Giselle implying that she is pregnant with Elliott's child?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could that be possible?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Elliott really loves her, then why would he show such deep affection towards me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, his parents and grandfather are so eager for a child. If he knows Giselle is pregnant, he will definitely divorce me immediately. Why would he deliberately delay the divorce with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, even Quinn fell into silence. His smiling face turned into a frowning one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn lowered his head to look at his phone, his fingers tapping the keyboard, seemingly chatting with someone. But I couldn't see the content on his phone screen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The joyful atmosphere at their table continued.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the news of Giselle's pregnancy, a guy at their table loudly called the waiter to bring a bottle of champagne. They wanted to celebrate for Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, our table seemed so gloomy and desolate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart was in turmoil.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I grabbed the glass on the table and poured myself another drink without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shouldn't do that. This is craft beer. Drinking too much can make you drunk."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about it. I want to drink. Don't stop me. Let me drink."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of endless bitterness surged in my heart. I pushed Quinn's hand away, poured another glass, and drank it all by myself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't do this! Things may not be as we think. Let's clarify the situation first, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn saw that I was struggling to control my emotions and grabbed my wrist, taking the glass from my hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just didn't want me to drink, but perhaps because we were struggling for the glass, Quinn accidentally spilled all the wine in the glass backwards.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden beer drew a parabola and all splashed onto the head of a guy at the next table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Who spilled beer on my head?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy immediately exclaimed and stood up, leaning over to look in our direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quickly turned around to apologize.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, buddy. It was an accident. We didn't mean to."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="327.html">« Prev</a><a href="329.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
