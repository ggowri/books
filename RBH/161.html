Those stubbles not only did not diminish his handsomeness, but instead made him more charmingly masculine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for me experiencing a completely different scenario in the previous life, if I hadn't seen him loving Giselle with my own eyes, then at this moment, seeing him so concerned about me, I would definitely be deeply moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reality is, I did not feel anything in my heart, on the contrary, I rather felt a bit pathetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of all this, I stole it from Giselle in advance... This feeling made me very uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is everything at the venue back to normal now? Were there any steel frames that were crooked? Did anyone get them repaired?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to avoid getting lost in my own thoughts, I quickly changed the subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, fortunately you discovered the problem in time. Jimmy and the others have been working overnight to fix it. The rain has also stopped now, and we expect to complete the entire construction by tomorrow evening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said in a low voice, and he reached out to touch my face, smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about the matters of the venue anymore, the most crucial thing for you now is to take good care of your injury."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, it's getting late and you're tired too, so go back and rest early."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more gentle he was to me, the more I became unaccustomed to it. At this moment, I really wanted to lie down alone for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't leave, I stayed here with you. If you want to sleep, go ahead. Don't worry, I have always been here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott whispered, his deep eyes filled with tenderness, making me unable to look directly at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I closed my eyes and, whether due to the effect of the medication or the slight concussion, I quickly fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I woke up again, the light outside the window was already very bright, making it almost impossible for me to open my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't open my eyes, but I faintly heard the sound of conversation coming from the ward. From the sound, it seemed to be Giselle and Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you come over again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I didn't sleep well all night. I feel guilty. This morning, I had my mom specially stew chicken noodle soup and brought it over to Madeline to help her recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She was still sleeping. It's okay, it's not your fault, you don't have to worry too much about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can I not blame myself? If I had discovered this hidden danger earlier and eliminated it, Madeline wouldn't have had such an accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their conversation, my consciousness became clearer and clearer. I opened my eyes and saw Giselle wearing a white dress, holding a pink lunchbox, standing pitifully in the center of the ward, while Elliott stood in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "Thank goodness you didn't find out earlier, otherwise soon enough, Elliott and I would have lost another property from our shared assets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened my eyes and instinctively moved my body. To my surprise, Elliott immediately sensed it. He turned his head and saw me waking up. He immediately walked over and raised the pillow under my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said gently, "Madeline, Giselle came to see you. Her mother made soup for you, would you like to have some?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, thank you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head and managed to squeeze out a smile at Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I should indeed thank her, otherwise, how could I have gotten such a good opportunity to perform and make Elliott's attitude towards me change?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="160.html">« Prev</a><a href="162.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
