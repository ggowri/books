I did not expect that Quinn would be waiting for me at the entrance of our company with his cool off-road vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still dressed in black. The weather was very cold, but he was only wearing a black leather jacket with a black T-shirt and seemed extraordinarily free and casual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw the bright smile on his face from afar, so I greeted him with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I got close to him, I punched him in the shoulder. He grabbed my hand and magically pulled out a box of yogurt from his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to pick up my son from work. This will give you some nutrition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took the box of yogurt from his hand and found that the outer packaging of the yogurt was still warm. And it took me a few seconds to realize that the son he was talking about was the baby in my belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know the baby is a boy?" I asked, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the car door and helped me get into the car. Then, he smiled mysteriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can feel it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn got in the car. Seeing that I was holding the yogurt but not opening it, he took it over, inserted a straw in it, handed it to me, and then said with a smile, "Call your mother and tell her that you won't go back for dinner tonight. There is a restaurant that has just opened in Hoswich. I heard that it is pretty good. I'll take you to try it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn had even arranged the dinner for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never thought that I would be cared for by others when I was pregnant after a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Quinn said he would be the father of the child in my belly, and he meant it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was moved by his gentleness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I called my mother and told her that I wouldn't go back for dinner. Not long afterward, Quinn took me to an alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He parked the car in the parking lot and got out of the car with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was still very cold in Hoswich in February. Wearing a woolen coat, I was shivering with cold as soon as I got out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Quinn took out a thick down jacket from the trunk, put it on my shoulders, and said to me, "Try it on. I bought this specially for you two days ago. It is very warm. You must not catch a cold again during this special period."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he bought this jacket for himself, but I found it fit me perfectly, then I realized that he had bought it for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so flattered that I didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through my eyes, he seemed to understand what I wanted to express. He put the hat of this down jacket on me and then said with a smile, "Don't be moved so soon. This is nothing. There will be things that move you even more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to be so nice to me. You owned me nothing. You don't have to be like this, Quinn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His relaxed tone made me feel relaxed. Then, I deliberately expressed my thoughts in a teasing tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't I owe you something? I probably owed you something in my previous life, so after my rebirth, I am willing to pay for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and put his arm around my shoulders, leading me into the alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Quinn hadn't brought me here, I wouldn't have known there was an old street hidden in the downtown area of Hoswich.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="559.html">« Prev</a><a href="561.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
