Help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The off-road vehicle suddenly slammed on the brakes in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, two men wearing combat uniforms got out of the car, and at that moment, those few people had already grabbed my arms, trying to drag me back into the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shouted in panic, and the two men who got off the off-road vehicle quickly approached upon seeing the situation. They were tall and quickly dealt with those few people. Afterward, they swiftly dragged me into their car and drove away from that place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting in the car, I had a feeling of surviving a disaster. Ignoring the pain in my feet, I quickly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, miss, you weren't bullied by them, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the front seat, a man's voice came, and this voice sounded very familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn Woods?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat up straight in my seat, startled, and quickly brushed aside the messy hair on my forehead. I focused my gaze ahead and took a quick glance at the front seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in front of me was clearly startled by my shout. He quickly turned his head, and as our eyes met, we both exclaimed in unison:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can hardly describe my current feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world was actually so small!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was abandoned by Elliott twice on the road and almost harassed by hooligans twice, and surprisingly, it was Quinn who saved me both times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was truly an incredible and magical fate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was even more surprised when he saw me. He first glanced at me from head to toe, then stared at me as if I were an alien, and said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, is that really you? Why were you running barefoot on the street in the middle of the night? Are you crazy or having an epileptic seizure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy, really doesn't know how to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were having an epileptic seizure! So why were you driving an off-road vehicle in the middle of the night, wearing combat gear? You were the one acting inexplicably--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I realized it was Quinn, I immediately felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was so late and a stranger's car, I was still a little worried that I had just escaped from one danger and now I was falling into another one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when I realized that it was Quinn, I felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Quinn asked his companion to stop the car. Then he jumped out of the car, opened the backseat door, and sat next to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you okay? Did anyone bully you? Let me see how your foot is doing--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw me curled up, with bloodstains all over my feet, and immediately grabbed my foot and placed it on his own knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw that the soles of my feet were covered in blood and there was a piece of glass stuck in the sole, he instantly gasped in disbelief, looking at me in astonishment. Then, unable to control himself, he let out a loud roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Elliott? Damn it, it's so late. How could he leave you alone on the street?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="127.html">« Prev</a><a href="129.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
