Otherwise, she would never have dared to confront him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's face turned ashen in an instant. As a prominent figure in Hoswich, he had never been publicly humiliated like this before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Quinn snatched Giselle's phone from her hand and flung it out the door as if it were trash.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? That's my phone!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's face went pale as she watched her beloved phone being tossed away. She instinctively moved to rush towards it, but Quinn grabbed her by the hair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should consider yourself lucky that I don't hit women. Otherwise, you'd be in a much worse state tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's words were delivered with a fierceness I had never seen before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His usually gentle eyes now exuded coldness, transforming him into a ferocious beast.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's unprecedented fury took me aback. His expression startled me to the core.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's friends stood in shock, attempting to intervene, but Quinn's overpowering presence kept them at bay.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had never been reprimanded like this before. Her face was a mix of despair as she looked at Quinn, and tears welled up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let her go, stop!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a chilling yet husky voice echoed from the entrance of the bar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I heard that voice, it was as if I was frozen in place by some spell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected him to show up here at this late hour.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott picked up the shattered remains of Giselle's phone from the ground and walked towards us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gloomy and handsome face appeared even more menacing under the bar's lighting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Approaching Quinn, Elliott wordlessly grabbed his arm, signaling him to release Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "It's evident he is trying to protect her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Giselle call him here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle has only just messaged him, so how does he arrive so quickly? Is he nearby all along?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he bring Giselle to the gathering and wait for her outside?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various speculations flooded my mind, and my spirits plummeted into an abyss again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing him, Giselle rushed into his arms as if he were her savior.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of me, she shamelessly clung to Elliott, wrapping her arms tightly around his waist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of their intimacy felt like a dagger through my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood there, trembling uncontrollably, barely able to keep my balance. Thankfully, Quinn suddenly reached out from behind and steadied me with his arm around my waist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle pointed an accusing finger at Quinn, her hand trembling as she spoke loudly. "Elliott, I was so scared just now. This guy was here with Madeline in the middle of the night, drinking. I just mentioned taking a photo to send to you, and he smashed my phone, threatening to hit me. Thank goodness you showed up in time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pretending to shiver, Giselle sought refuge in Elliott's embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attention of Giselle's group of friends was now entirely fixed on Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, figures like Elliott, who was prominent in the business world, were rarely seen in their circles.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Step aside."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone was indifferent, devoid of any discernible emotion. However, his gaze slowly descended upon me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="330.html">« Prev</a><a href="332.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
