After all, there were many people around, but he didn't let me go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kissed me deeply for almost a minute before letting me go with a smile. Seeing my blushing face, he chuckled and gently rubbed my nose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, we are a legitimate couple, but your action makes me feel as if I am molesting you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, we were a couple...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why did I always feel that he was as far away as the moon in the sky? Only at this moment did I feel that he was my husband.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I snuggled into his arms and said nothing, but I could not help smiling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind was still blowing, and there were many climbers on the top of the mountain. We hugged each other and enjoyed the wind for a while.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Elliott whispered to me, "It's time for us to get down, or it'll get cold."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," I responded gently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We held hands and started walking down the mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a little hungry. Fortunately, there were shops along the mountain road. Some vendors sold a local specialty snack. It was made of flour, wrapped with fresh meat and shrimp, and fried into pancakes. It smelled delicious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott bought one for me, but he didn't eat it. I took it and took a bite. It tasted very good, so I put it to his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Try it, it's really delicious."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never eat fried foods." Elliott frowned. His face filled with resistance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just take a bite, okay?" I said coquettishly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had no choice but to lower his head and take a bite in the place where I had just bitten.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the intimacy that couples should have, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott and I had just reached this step today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held the pancake that he had taken a bite of and ate it slowly as if I tasted happiness. This feeling of happiness and satisfaction made me feel in a trance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott held my hand all the time. Even though our palms were sweating a little, he didn't let go of my hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We walked down silently, and when we were halfway down, Elliott's phone rang.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott answered the phone. I didn't know what the person said on the other end of the phone, but I found his expression instantly turned solemn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll rush back now. You must let the best doctor treat Cormac and make sure that nothing will happen to him, or you'll have to face the consequences."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Elliott hung up the phone. He turned to look at me, and his face looked particularly solemn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? What happened to Cormac?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing what Elliott said, I felt something was wrong, and I asked him uneasily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cormac suddenly fell down at home, and he is now in the hospital. Madeline, we have to return to Hoswich as soon as possible," "Elliott said to me with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he quickened his pace and went down the mountain, and I quickly caught up with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew very well that Cormac was important to Elliott. He was worried after learning that Cormac had a fall.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, let's go back quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We didn't talk much and went down the mountain at a trotting pace. After we arrived at the parking lot and got in the car, Elliott drove onto the highway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drove at a high speed all the way to Hoswich. I grasped the handle without saying anything.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="211.html">« Prev</a><a href="213.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
