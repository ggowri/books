For a moment, an indescribable sensation washed over me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was just turning around. He didn't see Elliott's car leave. After he turned around, he opened the car window and waved at me, gesturing for me to go inside the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched Quinn leave, then turned back to see Austin still sitting on the sofa, seemingly waiting for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, why aren't you asleep yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately went over and sat next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to talk to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin looked at me, his gaze full of love. He patted my head, just like he did when I was a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, let's talk when you've recovered. Right now, please take care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced up at Austin's gaunt visage and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus has been coming to treat me occasionally, I'm feeling much better mentally. These days, Lily has also told me about everything that happened at home and the company before. You've been working hard during this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin looked at me, speaking with deep concern in his voice, his eyes full of intense affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Austin's words, I couldn't help but tingle, and I almost couldn't hold back my tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, a lot has indeed happened recently, but don't worry, I've handled everything. The Glory Group is slowly getting back on track. I've also told you about the next year's plans. Just focus on getting better. Don't worry about anything else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to burden Austin with unnecessary concerns, I offered him reassurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin nodded with relief, a long-lost smile appearing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not a child anymore. Maybe this accident and coma were a blessing in disguise. They made you mature quickly and have the ability to stand on your own. I'm very relieved to hand Glory Group over to you. Now, what I want to talk to you about is your marriage. Tell me honestly, what are your plans with Elliott?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin was very perceptive. He could see through my thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I want to part ways with Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Austin and told him truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Austin was mentally prepared, he still felt a shock when he heard my words. Then, he sighed deeply, "As your dad, of course, I want you to have a happy marriage. I also understand your pain. The Bryant family has really gone too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, perhaps this is an inevitable outcome. It's not anyone else's fault, only mine for being too humble, which led to being looked down upon. With this lesson, I won't make such mistakes again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly held Austin's hand and said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out and patted my head again. The long-lost warmth made me unable to help but rest my head on Austin's lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin said softly, "I'm glad you understand this lesson. When you insisted on marrying Elliott back then, I advised you, but unfortunately, you were young and couldn't listen to my words. Thankfully, you get it now. Since you want to separate from him, we'll support you. However, I don't want you to jump into another relationship right after ending one."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="463.html">« Prev</a><a href="465.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
