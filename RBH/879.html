Time flies! Look at you, you've been fond of me for so many years. There aren't many decades in a lifetime, just watch how I fulfill my promises."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gave a nonchalant smile, the very picture of a man determined to play the perfect husband to the hilt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His transformation was truly remarkable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's unclear whether this change is genuinely from his heart, or simply a result of his current amnesia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even though he's being his true self now, I keep reminding myself in my heart, this is just a part of the show.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'm a bit tired, I'll head upstairs to freshen up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I responded to his words with a nonchalant air, then made up an excuse, ready to head upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott forced me to down a few more sushi rolls before he finally let me off the hook. He told me to head upstairs while he stayed behind to clean up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I ascended the stairs, I noticed that the painting at the top of the second floor had been replaced.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Elliott had a classic Western painting hanging up. Now, he's had our picture turned into a piece of art and hung it in its place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This group photo was snapped during that time we went hiking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at this group photo, and thinking about everything that happened afterwards, I can't help but feel a wave of nostalgia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If our relationship had stayed as beautiful as it was in the beginning, without all the twists and turns that followed, I guess the life I'm living now with Elliott would be what I've always dreamed of, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I paused for a moment, taking it all in, before heading back to my bedroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time I finished my shower, Elliott had already returned to the bedroom, reeking of kitchen fumes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man, who used to shoo me off to the guest room at the slightest hint of cooking oil smell, has indeed changed a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he entered the room, he disdainfully stripped off all his clothes, quickly revealing his tall, sexy figure clad only in a pair of underwear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clad in my bathrobe, I stood frozen, staring at the scene before me. In a panic, I quickly lowered my gaze, seeking escape.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, didn't seem to care. Perhaps he knew I was shy, but he deliberately walked up to me, casually hooked his finger under my chin, and teased,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all these years of marriage, how can you still blush? I've got an itch on my back, would you mind scratching it for me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that I realized my face was flushed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, where does it itch?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As we drew close, a certain part of him began to swell reflexively. For a moment, I was unsure whether to look down or up, so I hastily asked him to turn around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scratch my shoulder blade, would you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. Here? Or here... here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I began to scratch him. But no matter where I scratched, he said it wasn't the right spot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so engrossed in tickling him that I didn't realize my hand had gradually moved from his back to his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was puzzling over why his ticklish spot was so elusive when he suddenly seized my hand, thrusting it onto his chest, declaring:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those places aren't right. The itchiest place is my heart. I panic now whenever I can't see you. Even though I know you don't need me that much, I can't help but want to do something for you. Do you think I'm less of a man now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me intently, unable to resist sharing the thoughts swirling within him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could sense his sincerity now, unlike before when it was all just manipulations and schemes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He... he's truly smitten, isn't he?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="878.html">« Prev</a><a href="880.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
