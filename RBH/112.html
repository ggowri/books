It's normal. Why do you say I'm shameless?" He didn't feel embarrassed at all, but rather said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what to say, so I angrily splashed the water from the bathtub into his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How shameless are you? Get out. Immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott evaded my ambush, and he looked at me meaningfully, his eyes sparkling and filled with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subconsciously, I once again used my hands to cover my private parts. However, I didn't have a towel. No matter how hard I tried to conceal my body, it was impossible to completely cover it with just my hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was in a panic, and my face turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bathroom was very humid, and Elliott's gaze became restless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but shout again, "Elliott, get out quickly. You were too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was very angry. However, I couldn't do anything and I couldn't do anything about him either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he stared at me dazedly, his demeanor was very gentlemanly. Eventually, he stood up and turned his back to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, he took out a clean white towel from the cabinet and threw it to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you finished washing, come out. Otherwise, it will thunder later, and you will get scared again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he casually walked out of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was still thundering at that time, and I stayed in the bathroom, listening to the terrifying thunder and feeling scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I realized that Elliott had left, I immediately stood up from the bathtub and quickly dried my body with a towel. Afterward, I used the towel to wipe off the water from my phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, the phone Quinn gave me was waterproof. Although it fell into the water, it didn't get damaged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath and did the basic skincare in front of the mirror. Then, I changed into my pajamas and walked out of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bedroom light had already been dimmed by Elliott. He sat on the bed, leaning against the headboard. He wasn't covered with a blanket, flipping through a finance book. He was wearing a bathrobe, with his long legs exposed. Elliott had a great figure. It's a pity he wasn't a model.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything that just happened still makes me feel embarrassed. I hesitated, standing in the same spot, not knowing what to do for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott did not look up, but it seemed that my actions did not escape his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He joked in a low voice, "Are you planning to sleep standing there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt embarrassed and couldn't help but ask, "If I lay down, can you guarantee that nothing will happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott lifted his head and glanced at me, his eyes filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I wasn't as thirsty as you thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did he mean by his words?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he say that I had no attraction to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt insulted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but lower my head and take a glance at myself. He was right. I wasn't curvy or sexy enough, but I wasn't unattractive either. Some men just like women with a skinny figure like mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott did not understand how to appreciate me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but complain in my heart. However, since he said so, I didn't need to stand there pretending to be reserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was very late. Tomorrow I had to accompany him to meet his parents. I thought about it and walked over. I pulled the new blanket I had brought over and crawled into it.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="111.html">« Prev</a><a href="113.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
