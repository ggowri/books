Are you choosing to be with Quinn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice was low and hoarse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was silent for a long time, struggling, but finally, I nodded slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My response hit Elliott like a ton of bricks. He staggered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could barely stand, holding onto the chair for support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me, then at Quinn, his lips trembling before he painfully asked:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline made up her mind long ago. If it weren't for your sudden amnesia and the doctor's orders, we would already be together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn stood up, putting his arm around my shoulder in front of Elliott, claiming his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, I wanted to pull away, but realizing it would hurt Quinn, I restrained myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's eyes were dark, his face pale under the dim light:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah is my child. We just reunited. Can you really separate us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clutched his chest, seemingly in great pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mentioning Noah... my heart ached too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, if not for everything that happened, we would have been a happy family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, too much has been broken. Trying to piece it back together is futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you decided to get engaged to Giselle, you ended your bond with Noah. Noah is my child. I chose to bring him into this world, and I intend to treat him as my own, with no ties to you or the Bryant family. I hope you understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Elliott calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since everything was out in the open, it was best to be clear to avoid future entanglements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hoped Elliott would understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he gave a bitter smile:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He has my blood, Madeline! How can I just give up? You're being too cruel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott still clutched his chest, looking too pained to stand, sinking back into his chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lobster on the table no longer smelled appetizing. The air felt cold, and the once warm family atmosphere was now icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a chill, my whole body trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Elliott like this, I felt awful and pained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But my mind was clear, reminding me of the vows I made during sleepless nights after our divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I might have been cruel then, but it didn't compare to the cruelty I faced from his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actions had consequences. The pain he felt then was what I once endured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you think Madeline is cruel, remember how you and your family treated her. Elliott, let go. Let me take care of Madeline and give her the happiness she deserves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn firmly held my cold hand, looking at Elliott and speaking calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's words must have hit hard. Elliott clutched his chest, stood up, and stared at Quinn with a fierce look, suddenly saying:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You give her happiness? Quinn, what do you have to offer her? You should know better than anyone if you can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's hand holding mine trembled, his whole body shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Quinn, puzzled. I could sense some hidden meaning in Elliott's words, but I had no idea what he was implying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I promised, I'll deliver. You don't need to worry about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To prove his point, Quinn thumped his chest and declared loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott shot Quinn a cold look, then suddenly stepped forward and forcefully pushed Quinn's hand off mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then grabbed my hand, cupped my face, and looked at me with deep affection:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, please give me another chance not just for me, but for Noah. I believe you want to give Noah a happy, complete family. After all, he's still so young!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Elliott finished, Quinn shoved him aside and grabbed my hand again, saying coldly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can give Noah a happy, complete family. I can treat him as my own and give him a simple, joyful childhood. The stability I offer Madeline, you can't match. You'd never give up Bryant Group for her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could feel that since I made my feelings clear, Quinn's attitude had become more assertive than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He truly wanted to build a happy family with me and had already given everything he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, no matter how much he loved me, he wouldn't give up Bryant Group, this vast business empire. And as long as he didn't, his schedule would always be packed...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man focused on his career wouldn't have much time for his wife and child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had experienced the loneliness of waiting for him at home, both in my past and present life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Quinn was different. He had a substantial family fortune that allowed him to be carefree. He could choose not to inherit the family business and spend lots of time with me and Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I'm willing to give up Bryant Group? Madeline, would you come back to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought Elliott would back off, but to my surprise, after a long pause, he asked me this serious question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd give up Bryant Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How was that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had put unimaginable effort into building Bryant Group to its current state. He always prioritized his career above everything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that he would be willing to give up his proudest achievement for me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he really need me that much? Love me that deeply?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him in disbelief. When I saw the passion in his eyes, an inexplicable instinct made me push Quinn's hand away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the sole heir of the Bryant family. Giving up isn't realistic..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but entertain a fleeting fantasy but quickly dismissed it as impractical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can hire a professional manager. I can make myself less busy. I'm willing to change everything for you. Madeline, whatever Quinn can do, I can too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my hesitation, Elliott stepped forward, promised in front of Quinn, and pulled me into his arms...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="913.html">« Prev</a><a href="915.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
