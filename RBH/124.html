We were not compatible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Are they going to break up so soon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Rowan already had a decent job and was about to buy a house in Hoswich, weren't these two conditions enough to sustain their relationship for a while longer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was surprised, but calmly asked, "How is that possible? I saw your boyfriend at the flower shop the other day. I thought you two were actually quite compatible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle probably didn't expect me to ask her this, as she coughed several times suddenly, as if she was choked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing, she hurriedly said, "Actually, we had just started dating. Before that, he was the one pursuing me. We didn't have a real romantic relationship. And, my mother also didn't approve of us being together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's words clearly distanced herself from her relationship with Rowan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she deliberately saying it for Elliott to hear?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about the hairpin I saw on Elliott's car that day, I couldn't help but wonder how far he and Giselle had progressed up until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Giselle already see hope in Elliott?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh. What kind of guys do you like? Maybe, my darling and I can help introduce you to someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Elliott was still not moving, I deliberately reached out to grab his hand and intentionally called him "darling" in front of Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She was still young. She could wait for another two years before dating. There was no rush for such matters, and there was no need for introductions either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Giselle to not have spoken yet, and Elliott directly rejected my proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, when I held his hand, I clearly felt that his fingers were somewhat stiff, as if all ten fingers were resisting my approach and not shaking hands with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Elliott told me last night to focus on my work for now and not to pursue romantic relationships. He also said that once I excel in my job, I will naturally encounter a good love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle sweetly said at this moment. Her words clearly carried an indescribable sweetness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that last night, Elliott not only took Nicole to the hospital but also had a long chat with Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder he saw everything of mine when he came home last night, but he remained calm and peacefully fell asleep next to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, all the time points were connected in my mind. I suddenly seemed to have found all the answers, and a great sense of defeat surged up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately withdrew my hand from Elliott's grip, desperately trying to conceal the impending breakdown of emotions, and instinctively shifted my gaze towards the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, a car passed by the square at that moment. Unaware of what day it was, several couples were unabashedly embracing each other, causing my already flustered heart to become even more flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car finally arrived at the entrance of Nicole's flower shop. Giselle and Nicole got out of the car and waved goodbye to us. Toby, who hadn't seen them for a long time, also got off here and planned to stay with Nicole and Giselle for one night.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="123.html">« Prev</a><a href="125.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
