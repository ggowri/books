Mrs. Bryant, why don't you spend some time alone with Mr. Bryant? I'll be right outside the door."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry stepped forward, and despite Elliott still being unconscious, he bowed deeply as he always did. Then, he respectfully retreated and closed the door to the hospital room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat quietly next to Elliott, holding his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to the prolonged period of lying down and unconsciousness, his fingers were icy cold. The knuckles were distinct, and his skin was even paler than before, but it was a sickly kind of pale. The veins on the back of his hand were faintly visible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, why are you such a fool? Rushing off alone to save me, aren't you afraid of dying?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've already parted ways, you really didn't have to do this. Did you think that risking your life to save me would win back my heart? How old are you? How can you be more naive than a young boy?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I've told you before, I don't hate you, I just don't love you anymore. It's over between us, so why are you doing this? Making it seem like I owe you a huge favor. Do you want me to repay this favor? If so, then wake up. Once you're awake, we can sit down, face to face, and discuss how I can repay you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I've seen all that stuff you've been posting online. What's that about? Your way of reciprocating for the diary I wrote for you back in the day? You think a webpage link is a fair trade for a diary? Don't you think you're being a bit childish, still living like you used to? You know, when I saw all that, I really wanted to laugh. I never expected that all your past depth was just a facade. Your real thoughts are actually quite simple, aren't they?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, can you hear me? If you can, blink your eyes. Didn't you say on that website how much you loved me, how much you missed me? Well, here I am, right in front of you. Madeline, alive and well. Won't you open your eyes and look at me? Or at least blink, give me some kind of response, Elliott&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held Elliott's hand, instinctively starting a conversation with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the days when he was lucid, there was no way I could have had such lengthy conversations with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, seeing him lying here so peacefully, for some reason, these words just slipped out of my mouth without me even realizing it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as I spoke, tears welled up, unbidden, in my eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the end of the day, we're all creatures of emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, it's me forcing myself to be ruthless. If he were standing in front of me, perfectly fine, I would never waver. But now, every time I think about how he ended up like this because he saved me, my heart cracks open, again and again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry claimed his situation was a hot mess. I had no clue just how deep he was in, or what was to come.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott wouldn't remain unconscious forever because he saved me, would he?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that's the case, then how... how am I supposed to view myself from now on?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more I thought about it, the more my heart began to race, especially after pouring out so much to him, only to be met with his utter lack of response. My mind was in complete disarray.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat alone in his hospital room, shedding tears for what felt like an eternity, uttering words I would normally never dare to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, my mouth was parched from talking, yet Elliott showed no sign of reaction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the door to the sickroom swung open, and Barry strolled in from outside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rose to my feet, quickly steadying my emotions, and turned to Barry, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, I gave it my all, but Elliott..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could even finish my sentence, the device suddenly chimed in with a sharp "beep".</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="763.html">« Prev</a><a href="765.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
