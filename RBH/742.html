When I opened the car window and fiercely smashed the thermos cup on his head, he was stunned and immediately let go of Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane! Hurry! Get in the car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shouted at Jane in a hurry and quickly opened the car door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane quickly realized what was happening and immediately climbed into the car without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tattooed man, at this moment, came to his senses and immediately reached out to grab Jane's arm. Fortunately, I suddenly remembered that the thermos was filled with hot water poured in the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I opened the thermos directly and quickly splashed it onto the face of the tattooed man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thermos is not only heavy, but also has a good insulation effect. The water is still very hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face immediately turned red and swollen. For a moment, he couldn't even bother to deal with Jane. At that moment, I forcefully pulled Jane, and she quickly got into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the accomplices of the tattooed man realized something was wrong. They rushed over, but luckily, I immediately closed the car door and locked the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few minutes, Jane was left bruised all over by them. Her shirt was almost torn apart, and her jeans were also slashed. I felt really sorry for her and quickly hugged her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We saw that we had locked the car, and the tattooed man was furious, banging wildly on the outside of the car. He even grabbed a stick and relentlessly pounded on the car window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were fierce and terrifying, making people scared. Jane and I knew we had to take immediate action. Ignoring her wound, Jane immediately crawled into the driver's seat and quickly started the car!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was a brave girl, she fearlessly confronted the tattooed man and his companions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing us directly fighting with them, they were also taken aback. They all ran away and quickly disappeared from our sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, they ran away, but Mr. Woods is still being controlled by them. What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that they all ran away, Jane immediately asked me anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They deceived us, Quinn was not caught by them! It's all a scam! Jane, we need to find a way immediately, take our money and quickly leave this terrible place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I angrily said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Mr. Woods isn't here? Then who is the man in the video? Ms. Mayers, are you sure that man isn't Mr. Woods?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what I said, Jane immediately turned her head with an incredulous expression and looked at me, asking in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just now, Quinn called me. He wasn't kidnapped. Obviously, these people must know </span><span>about my relationship with Quinn, so they deliberately had someone pretend to be Quinn. They want to deceive me and take away 10 million dollars in cash! By the way, where are those boxes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly came to my senses and quickly glanced out of the car window. When I realized that those suitcases were still in place and had not been taken away by those people, I instantly breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there were no 10 million dollars in cash in the box, 2 million dollars is still a lot, and I couldn't let these people take away the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching them all run away, I immediately opened the car door and quickly opened the trunk. I wanted to move all those suitcases into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane ignored her injuries and got out of the car to help me carry these boxes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was urgent, and we didn't waste any time. We just wanted to take the money and leave this terrible place as quickly as possible.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="741.html">« Prev</a><a href="743.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
