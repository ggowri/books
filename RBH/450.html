It was a pity for the innocent baby in Giselle's belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously put my hands on my lower abdomen. Thinking of the test results just now, I couldn't help worrying about myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, the child in my belly has no fetal heart now, which makes me worried. I never thought I would be pregnant, so I had drunk several times before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop worrying. The baby will be fine. Drinking in the early stages of pregnancy will have little impact on the baby's development. He is just a seed. Just take it easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona hurriedly comforted me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes. There was no need to worry at this moment. Let nature took its course.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I attempted to stop my worries. At that moment, Adam walked into Fiona's office carrying a lot of breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I have no idea what you like to eat now, so I bought a copy of all the breakfasts around here. These are bacon, bread, omelet, croissant, hash browns, and waffles. Oh, the others are donuts, coffee, burgers..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam carried a large bunch of breakfast, which looked highly exaggerated. Then, he placed them on Fiona's office desk, introducing them one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the series of breakfasts he bought, Fiona and I were dumbfounded. Then, we looked at each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, how could I finish so much alone? It's such a waste for you to buy so many breakfasts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pulled a wry face after seeing his exaggerated behavior. Then, I couldn't help sighing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It proves that he is considerate. Since he bought them for you, you should enjoy them. You are pregnant now, so you can enjoy any kind of treatment you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giving a meaningful look to Adam, Fiona couldn't help teasing me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew her thoughts well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few years ago, she and Paige had advised me to give up Elliott and approach other excellent men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, once a woman decided to stop falling in love and stop treating one person wholeheartedly, she would find her life was colorful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I heard the fetus' gender will affect the pregnant woman's flavor. Anyway, I bought all kinds of food, including sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, and salty flavors. Which one would you like to eat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam raised his eyebrows at me, saying expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked around at the breakfasts he bought one by one. Honestly, due to the severe early pregnancy reactions, I had no appetite at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, looking at Adam's sweaty look, I knew he gave a lot of care in buying these breakfasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I chose the Beef Consomm&eacute;, which looked a little bland from the many breakfasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's it. It looks delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was bland, but it smelled fragrant of beef. I took a sip. It tasted good. I could eat it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You like to eat bland food. Maybe you will have a son. My mother always said that she loved bland food while pregnant with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam smiled brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great! If so, the Bryant family will definitely regret it! They are so wicked and heartless. Otherwise, how could they dislike you, a nice girl, but provoke those unscrupulous vixens?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slumping in her chair due to laughing, Fiona couldn't help gloating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Giselle's pregnancy test report just now, I knew what Fiona meant. I silently ate Beef Consomm&eacute;. I had a bad appetite, but I kept telling myself that I must eat more for the sake of the baby in my belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam received a call at this time, so he walked out. Soon, he walked in again, holding the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam seemed to receive great news, so that he shouted with great joy after entering the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I have great news for you! Our Do Not Love has been shortlisted for the Emmy Awards, and the organizer has invited us to participate in this grand ceremony!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="449.html">« Prev</a><a href="451.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
