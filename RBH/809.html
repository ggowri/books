Dalton, along with the core team of the crew, welcomed us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We've reviewed the sample, participated in their discussion meetings, and offered suggestions from an investor's perspective.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my past life, I've seen this movie. And, because it inspired me so much, I still remember which scenes were the most touching, which were the climaxes, and where the flaws lay.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, when they showed me the sample, I gave my suggestions with pinpoint accuracy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton was taken aback. He hadn't expected that, despite being an amateur, my advice would be so seasoned, ruthless, and spot-on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a little nudge from me, Dalton immediately had his team re-edit the film, making necessary adjustments.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We observed and debated, over and over again. Time flew, and before we knew it, a week had passed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the discussion, I transferred another sum of money to them for promotional purposes, as per our contract agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterwards, Adam and I took off together, planning to head home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as we were about to leave the hotel, suddenly, Adam pointed ahead and asked:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, is that guy Mr. Bryant?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, I immediately cast my gaze in the direction he pointed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That silhouette was all too familiar to me. So, with just one glance, I knew, it had to be Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood a short distance away, his back to me, one hand casually tucked in his pocket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman, clad in a white trench coat paired with a chiffon skirt, was chatting with him, her body angled towards him as she laughed merrily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because they were so far away, we couldn't make out a word of their conversation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, my gaze was firmly fixed on that woman, because she was none other than Lisa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been swamped this week, with Elliott ringing me up every day. But each time, I'd just rush through a few words before hanging up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't mention to me that he too had come to Norch City.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what's more, he's with Lisa, which really threw me for a loop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, should we go over and say hi?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me frozen, Adam quietly asked me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need. We have other matters to attend to."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam and I are planning a trip to Edulet City. Jane and Marcus are over there, overseeing the development of the medicinal herb base. I want to meet up with them and check on how things are progressing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We immediately spun around and headed for the parking lot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sliding into the driver's seat, my hands took control of the steering wheel, guiding the car onto the open road. Yet, my mind was still wrestling with the scene I had just witnessed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found the car unusually heavy today, the steering wheel was damn heavy too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I was puzzling over what was happening, Adam whispered in my ear:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you didn't release the handbrake. You seem distracted. Maybe I should drive instead."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" His words made me realize that I had indeed forgotten to release the handbrake. I was momentarily dumbfounded, then burst into laughter. "But you've been up all night, driving now would be fatigue driving. You should take a nap in the car, I'll drive until I'm tired and then we can switch."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I released the handbrake, forcing myself to focus. Then, I drove off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car hit the road, then zoomed off down the highway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather was splendid that day, absolutely glorious. I was donning my sun-blocking shades, skillfully maneuvering the steering wheel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when I was feeling pretty good, I suddenly sensed that the black sedan behind me seemed to be tailing me at a safe distance... and it had been doing so for quite some time...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="808.html">« Prev</a><a href="810.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
