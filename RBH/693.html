However, he said that no matter how busy he was, he had to make time to do something. This was what he owed you before. Ms. Mayers, Mr. Bryant really cares about you. He has been calling your name several times even when he was drunk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know why Trevor loved to talk so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he assign you a task? The previous driver, Toby, didn't talk as much as you do..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Trevor heard me say this, he awkwardly laughed out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, Mr. Bryant instructed me not to say anything, but I couldn't help but want to tell you myself. To be honest, I have driven for many powerful people before. However, this is the first time I have met a man as wealthy and devoted as Mr. Bryant, so I couldn't resist saying a few more words for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rich and loyal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Give it up. I admit I have money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devotion? Forget it. He just didn't know how many women Elliott had brought into the car before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was rich and quite affectionate. You have worked for him for a short time. In a little while, you will know the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor saw that his words did not move me, but instead had the opposite effect, so he closed his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly drove me to Glory Group. After parking the car, I quickly got out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pair of rings was directly forgotten by me on the back seat of the car. Although it was a style that I had long admired, I no longer needed it, so there was no need to take it with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Elliott went through so much trouble to get these rings, let's leave them to him and let him use this ring to tell a story to his next girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked into the company confidently. As soon as I arrived at the office, Adam immediately knocked on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He has become more and more skilled in his work now. I directly assigned several important projects to him. He only needs to report the progress to me on time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Adam and I finished our presentation, he suddenly asked me, "Madeline, do you still remember the director named Dalton Lewis?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dalton Lewis?" My mind quickly raced, "Yes, I have. I saw him at an awards ceremony once. Why do you suddenly bring him up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He has been shooting a patriotic-themed movie recently. However, due to its sensitive content and the increasing restrictions on censorship, this movie encountered financial difficulties halfway through production. Dalton has approached many companies, but no one is willing to invest in this movie. A few days ago, he came here and mentioned that he had met you once. So, I wanted to ask you specifically if what he said is true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I heard him say that, I immediately slapped my forehead hard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, how could I forget about this thing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous life, it was this director named Dalton Lewis who, when everyone had no faith in him, managed to achieve a box office success of over 20 million dollars with a patriotic-themed film. He also became famous because of this film. The investors of this film also made a lot of money as a result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I met him at the awards ceremony, I planned to invest in his film. However, later on, due to various factors such as pregnancy and the pandemic, I gradually forgot about this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me make an appointment with him these two days. After meeting him, I will </span><span>decide whether to proceed with the investment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately said to Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone suddenly knocked on the door of my office and then shouted at me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="692.html">« Prev</a><a href="694.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
