Those bloody memories were too unbearable to even look back on. Every time I triggered a memory, it was a heart-wrenching process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night was a turning point in Elliott and Giselle's relationship, it was the day when Giselle took advantage of this opportunity and climbed up to Elliott's social status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I, sitting in the car, looking at the pouring rain outside the window, at that moment, there was only one voice echoing in my heart, "I will never let Giselle be the protagonist of this matter again. Tonight, the protagonist must be me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I casually made up an excuse and didn't tell Adam the true purpose of where I was going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened Instagram, clicked on Giselle's profile, and saw what she had posted on Instagram. It was no longer about the flowers in her mother's flower shop, but all about the details of this exhibition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She posted photos of herself wearing a safety helmet at the scene of the scissor-hand competition. She posted a picture of her finger accidentally injured and bleeding while supervising at the scene. She posted a picture of the fast food she ate at the scene. She also posted a stack of exhibition-related materials after returning home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything, without exception, was subtly revealing that she was a girl who worked diligently, positively, and with great effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And under her Instagram post where her thumb was injured, I saw that Elliott liked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How much attention does Elliott have to pay to someone in order to give her a like, considering that he rarely browses Instagram?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This praise made my nerves even more painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was already well aware that my feelings towards Elliott were no longer just simple love and hate, but rather a revenge, a revenge for his heartlessness towards me in his past life, a revenge for his love with Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam quickly got off the highway, but there was still no sign of the rain stopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was a replay of the previous life, except for my role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Adam dropped me off at the International Exhibition Center, it was already evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, with such heavy rain, either I accompany you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam looked for an umbrella in the car and handed it to me. Seeing that the rain was pouring heavily, he worriedly said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, I'll go back after I finish my work. You've worked hard these past two days, so go back and rest well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I patted Adam's shoulder and then opened the umbrella, walking towards the International Convention Center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly arrived at the venue, even though it was raining heavily, the scene was still bustling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the expo is about to start, the construction is urgent. I took a tour around the venue and soon spotted Giselle, who was wearing a raincoat and standing in the rain, talking to the workers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle also saw me, she first looked surprised, and then she immediately walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, how did you come here? It's raining so heavily--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because it rained so heavily, I was a bit worried, so I came to take a look. Can this greenhouse withstand such heavy rain? Giselle, find the person in charge of the construction team, I need to talk to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I frowned as I looked at the somewhat messy scene, and then said to Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't worry, I have double-checked everything and they have assured me that there won't be any issues. With such heavy rain, you can either go back first or come to our office and sit for a while, I'll be here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle probably couldn't figure out why I came over, so she said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You do as I instructed first, otherwise I won't feel at ease."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did not listen to her arrangement and said to her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle, upon hearing this, nodded and went to find the person in charge of the construction team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that she hadn't noticed the problem yet, so I arrived just in time...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="155.html">« Prev</a><a href="157.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
