Yet, I had no intention of offering him any comfort.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems, only in this way, can I make myself feel a bit better.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evidently, my words had struck a chord with Elliott. He shot me a glance, then chuckled softly under his breath. His expression was one of sheer resignation:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stingy? So, that's how you see me now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stepped forward, grabbing hold of his arm:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you've been standing out here for too long, you'll catch a cold. Come in and grab a bite to eat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The concern laced in my words seemed to soothe him. His tone instantly softened:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you still care if I've eaten or not. I thought you couldn't even see me anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could it be? I was just too engrossed in watching the commotion from the sidelines. I thought you were right behind me all along."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I feared he might misunderstand, so I decided to clarify.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he suddenly wrapped his arms around me from behind, burying his face in the crook of my neck. The faint scent of smoke mingled with his cologne, creating a unique aroma that filled my nostrils. His voice was a low, barely audible whisper:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it's been ages since we last met. I've truly missed you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is clearly a cheesy pick-up line.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, whenever he uttered such words, I would involuntarily melt into a puddle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, hearing these words, I don't just feel indifferent. Instead, I'm actually annoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been a bit swamped lately, there's a lot going on at the company."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words just tumbled out of my mouth without thinking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that fleeting moment, such familiar words stirred memories of times past.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when I loved him deeply, countless times I tried to bridge the gap between us in various ways, but all I ever got was this one sentence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, this phrase was nothing more than an emotionless excuse, crafted carefully to avoid causing excessive heartache.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to naively fool myself into believing he was just too busy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until this moment that I realized, it wasn't that he was too busy. He simply didn't care about me back then, just like how I feel about him now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emotions, they're the hardest thing to fake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The emotions within a person tend to reveal themselves, whether we like it or not. Trying to mask or play a role not only proves challenging, but it can also be downright exhausting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So... where am I staying tonight?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was still raspy, his breath fanning across my face. It was a simple sentence, yet it was laden with an ambiguous undertone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The answer to this question, I had it figured out the moment he showed up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's plenty of rooms here. I've had Jane set up an extra one. You and Barry bunk together. Quinn and Marcus share another. Sound good?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Elliott let go of me, his brows furrowing slightly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're saying we're not living together?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The room's cramped, mate. I'm bunking with Jane. The place ain't much, so bear with us. We can't exactly have Barry kipping in the car now, can we?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no choice but to patiently explain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, I didn't need to compete with Jane for the room at all. But, from the moment Elliott showed up, I've been deliberately avoiding any intimate actions with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As sharp as Elliott is, there's no way he wouldn't catch the undertone in my words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't persist any further. In that fleeting moment, I noticed his expression sinking deeper into despair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out another cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and took a deep drag. His handsome face was etched with loneliness.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="815.html">« Prev</a><a href="817.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
