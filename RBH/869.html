Numbers don't lie, Madeline, there's no need for modesty. I realize now that I was the one holding you back. I owe you an apology."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally realized that I'm not some helpless little woman who revolves her entire world around him every day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mood involuntarily improved, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You once labeled me as a woman who only knew how to love."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I apologize. I didn't know you well enough then," Elliott said, his laughter echoing in the air as he gently took my hand, examining it as if it were a piece of fine art. "I thought I was marrying a delicate damsel, but instead, I find myself wedded to a formidable businesswoman who commands the winds and waves of the corporate world."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Which woman doesn't enjoy a good compliment?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when the praise comes from someone who once belittled you at every turn, but now genuinely appreciates you.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm far from being a strong, independent woman. Moreover, I've never aspired to be one."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, I've let you down, haven't I? You would have rather been the perfect wife and mother for me, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott cradled my face, his eyes filled with remorse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, that was the old me, with no grand ambitions, solely focused on taking care of the man I loved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, ever since I've tasted the joy of success, I've become unstoppable, never wanting to revert back to my former self.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was then. Now, I aspire to be a woman who forsakes love, focusing solely on her career. When I achieve success, what will men amount to? Even the most powerful of them will be nothing more than ordinary in my eyes."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I teased on purpose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'm feeling pretty anxious right now. To prevent you from 'abandoning love', I need to step up my game. I don't want you to leave me in the future without even saying goodbye."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott chuckled lightly, affectionately pinching my nose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me, his deep-set eyes brimming with a tender mix of passion and desire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The proximity between us was too close for comfort. Suddenly, he couldn't help himself and swept me up, settling me onto his lap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, his wristband wrapped around my waist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I frantically struggled to get up, but he wouldn't let me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kiss me, and I'll let you up. Otherwise, forget about getting back to work."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pouted like a child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much I struggled, I was no match for him. In the end, I said in resignation:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I've got a ton of work to do."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The usually rational him, surprisingly started to play dirty:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what? I've got bigger fish to fry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pissed me off to the point of speechlessness, and in my anger, I gave his arm a hard pinch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grunted softly, yet he held onto my slender waist tightly, refusing to let go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The standoff lasted for quite a while.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, I had no choice but to compromise, planting a perfunctory kiss on his cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hearty laugh, he finally let go of me. Just then, a crisp sound of something falling echoed from the doorway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I jerked my head up in a panic, realizing the person who had just walked in was Quinn.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="868.html">« Prev</a><a href="870.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
