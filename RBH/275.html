Welcome to my domain! Now, let's get into the birthday spirit. Please welcome our very own Mr. S!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's voice carried across the room, setting the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he was still dressed in his vampire attire, with a white devil mask adorning his face. Just as he finished speaking, I suddenly realized that the man beside me had vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, I witnessed him, clad in a black robe and wearing a mask, suddenly ascended the stage and strode toward a white piano, in which a microphone was already set up beside it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A performance was about to start, and I couldn't look away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he the mysterious Mr. S Quinn mentioned?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And whose birthday were we celebrating tonight?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My curiosity piqued, and I kept my eyes fixed on the enigmatic figure on stage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men in black robes who had been sitting with us in the booth rose to their feet. Philip, having put his mask back on, whispered something to the angel he had been talking to before joining the others on stage. They struck poses, seemingly preparing to dance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Mr. S delicately moved his fair fingers across the piano keys and began his performance. Instantly, I recognized the melody as 'Burning', a song I had loved during my school days and had written about in my diary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn then picked up a bass guitar, joining the other band members to accompany Mr. S in his performance. To my surprise, Mr. S not only played the piano skillfully but also began to sing into the microphone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was rich, and his rhythm was precise, infusing the song with a unique charm that made my heart tremble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could this person truly be Elliott?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, his voice and gestures were too similar to Elliott's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip and the other men began to dance while Quinn played the guitar in harmony. The dazzling lights captivated everyone in the audience, freezing time as all eyes focused on the performance on the not-so-large stage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite wearing a black robe and a mask, Mr. S exuded a powerful presence. He played the piano and sang with ease. His tender expression and familiarity with the song instantly brought me back to the days when I was infatuated with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My emotions that were long suppressed, hidden, and diluted surged forth with the music's beat. Those years of secretly admiring him, and those moments captured in my diary, all came rushing back as if played out in a movie on the screen of my mind.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="274.html">« Prev</a><a href="276.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
