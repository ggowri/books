Don't you want to know why Quinn is so good to me? It's because we have been in love for a long time. Everything I did for you was just to make you fall in love with me. Then, you would know how it feels to not win one's heart. Besides, I don't want you to be with Giselle. If someone else wore my clothes, I would feel disgusted, let alone a man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at him, thinking, "I probably don't love him anymore, so when I say these words, I don't care about his dignity. I just want to vent my anger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was angry, and he squeezed my neck even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, these better be just empty words from you. Otherwise, you know the consequences of provoking me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, stop! Let go of her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I was out of breath, Quinn rushed over. He punched Elliott in the face. Then, he quickly pulled me behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood dripped from the corner of Elliott's mouth as he stood still, wiping the blood off his mouth. His gaze towards me and Quinn was filled with humiliation and pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. During this period, I have been reflecting on myself. I didn't expect that I would be a fool. Both of you betrayed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that he had already believed my words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn probably didn't hear our conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Elliott's words, he asked, "Elliott, what do you mean? Madeline and I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn wanted to argue, but I quickly pinched him on the back. Quinn immediately </span><span>understood and stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Madeline and I had been in love for a long time. From now on, I will protect her. Since you two have already divorced, please stop bothering her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's words confirmed what I had said. After hearing Quinn's words, Elliott became even more indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph. My best friend and my ex-wife..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott let out a helpless and desolate laugh. At that moment, I could feel the brokenness in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For my child, I had to be cruel. Only in this way, the Bryant family wouldn't take away my child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, have you finished speaking? If you have, you can leave," I said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stopped his self-deprecating laugh. He looked at me and Quinn with indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "Tell Paige that as long as she spares Jezebel, I can agree with her any demand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott immediately regained a calm tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his words were like a knife stabbing deeply into my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment he appeared in front of me, I felt that he must have been sent by Giselle to plead with Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just said so much. His intention was simply to plead for Jezebel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, I couldn't help but silently let out a self-mocking laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so affectionate just now, and I almost believed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were in the past, perhaps I would have already believed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that this was his ultimate goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How ironic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible. Paige would not let Jezebel go. If you immediately send Giselle and her son abroad and never allow them to return, I might help you persuade Paige..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew Elliott wouldn't agree, but I couldn't help but want to make things difficult for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He once said that he would send them abroad after Giselle's child was born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to see if Elliott could walk the talk. Or, he deceived me once again...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="612.html">« Prev</a><a href="614.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
