By the time I realized who she was, she had already gained control of all the initiative, and I was left only with the passive role of being beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at this moment, seeing her sharp words and unyielding tone, I finally understood that beneath this young girl's gentle appearance, she was actually quite tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had obviously seen something essential through a photo, otherwise she wouldn't be so angry and come to question me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her so angry, I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of satisfaction in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The angrier she became, the more she lost her sense of proportion, while I, ignoring her, was the best weapon to deal with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ignored her and didn't reply to her anymore, but continued to drink with Rowan and Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meal was really spicy, I was so spicy that I drank a lot of beer in one breath, and Adam told several jokes, which made me laugh very happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have never laughed so relaxed before. Unexpectedly, this guy Adam not only made me laugh, but also took a blurry photo of me when I wasn't paying attention, and then posted it on his Instagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also added a line of text, saying Madeline was very happy tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy, being single anyway, had no concerns whatsoever and actually directly named me his goddess on Instagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I saw the words he posted on Instagram, I couldn't help but laugh and cry at the same time, so I had to give him a like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised me was that Giselle probably also had Adam's contact information. Seeing the Instagram post Adam made and the likes I gave, she actually sent me a message saying, "Madeline, I didn't know you and Adam were so close. He posted this on Instagram, aren't you afraid Elliott would mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really didn't know what she was thinking at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would get jealous of Rowan one moment, jealous of Elliott the next moment, but this time, did she also get jealous of Adam?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to think that she had a little bit of vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, tonight her extremely angry words have made it increasingly difficult for me to understand what she was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was too lazy to argue with her, so I decided to continue ignoring her. However, not long after, when I opened Instagram again, I was surprised to see that Rowan had posted an Instagram with a couple photos of him and Giselle. Moreover, he added a line of text, saying that she is his forever goddess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan was clearly sitting across from me, and just a moment ago, I distinctly saw him frowning while holding his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is probably Giselle forcing him to post, and if I guess correctly, even the caption on Instagram is requested by Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To confirm my guess, I jokingly said with a smile, "Rowan, how did you go from having dinner with us to suddenly showing affection to your girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Rowan awkwardly and reluctantly said, "Ah, don't mention it. My girlfriend insisted that I post it, and she even threatened to block me if I didn't. She's really difficult to deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's action was clearly a blatant demonstration against me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What does she want to explain? Does she want to explain that her charm has not diminished, or does she want to explain that her charm is not worse than mine, or something else?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="193.html">« Prev</a><a href="195.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
