You used to always say that I wasn't suitable for attending these occasions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately agreed, but I couldn't help but tease him a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no expression, but he shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, you showcased your piano performance in front of them. Additionally, how was your Lumarian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that my performance at the last mid-year banquet caught Elliott's attention and revealed my shining qualities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lumarian was okay, but I haven't spoken it in several years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I calmly smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, when I say "just okay," I am being modest. In fact, my parents hired a professional foreign teacher for me since I was young in order to cultivate me, so my Lumarian is actually not a big problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then you cooperate with me at that time. If we can successfully negotiate this deal, the Bryant Group's business portfolio for this year will expand again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said in a low voice, he said "we", which made me slightly startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this person already treating me as part of the Bryant family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that he not only had no intention of divorcing me, but also valued me more and was willing to accompany me to some important occasions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it's also good this way, they won't get together so quickly, and Giselle has Rowan now, so she probably won't have any contact with Elliott for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I thought about it, I suddenly felt inexplicably happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I have never accompanied Elliott to receive important guests, based on my past memories, I remember that such heavyweight reception work requires the use of many flowers and flower baskets for decoration. Moreover, from picking up the VIPs at the airport to entering the Bryant Group building, including the arrangement in the meeting room, it definitely needs to be set up and decorated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's family only had a small flower shop. Could they handle all these flower arrangements? And could Elliott be at ease?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, I couldn't help but ask, "So, who are you planning to have do the venue setup this time? It won't be Giselle, will it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Elliott nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle's profession is event planning. She said that she had helped her mother with the decoration of many large-scale events during her time in college, so there shouldn't be any problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a natural fondness for Giselle, and besides that, he had a natural trust in her, which made me envious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh - it's better to have a Plan B, just in case she doesn't do well, at least there can be some remedy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but suggest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott heard my words, but he seemed unhappy. He said lightly, "Regarding the collaboration on flowers, it has already been settled, so there is no need to discuss it further. In the future, if there are other collaborations, I will prioritize your friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I were to mention Elliott's appearance again, I'm afraid he would get angry directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget it... It seems that I couldn't do anything about this matter. Although I am very unwilling, I can only accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's it, this time it couldn't go on, we can only start from somewhere else in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once people get busy with work, time often flies by. In the blink of an eye, the day arrived for the Bryant Group to host the esteemed guest, Dikio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to match Elliott's outfit, I specially tailored a simple and elegant dark blue dress. The top is a fitted suit with a thin waist belt, perfectly outlining the waistline. The bottom is a knee-length skirt, paired with a pair of shallow white leather shoes. Inside, I added a white shirt as a decoration. With this combination, the overall look is dignified, elegant, clean and appropriate. In order to match me, Elliott specifically chose a dark blue tie to match his custom navy blue suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After we dressed up, we stood in front of the mirror and scrutinized each other for a while. Then, we went out together and drove to the airport.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="97.html">« Prev</a><a href="99.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
