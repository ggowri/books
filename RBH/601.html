At that moment, I couldn't help but snatch the phone from Philip's hand. I saw the nickname "Jez" in the chat box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jez... What an intimate way to call her! He didn't change at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I became very angry. When I caught sight of their chat messages containing words like "baby", I couldn't control myself and threw Philip's phone onto the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip, you're going too far. Paige is pregnant, but you are secretly fooling around with that kind of woman. What's the difference between you and a scumbag?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip was scared half to death by my reaction. Then, he quickly glanced around. Paige hadn't come back yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his voice and said, "Madeline, keep your voice down. I don't want this to happen. This woman is clinging to me. I tried to get rid of her, but I failed. I can only do this for now. Don't tell Paige. I promise that after Paige gives birth, I will no longer have any contact with Jezebel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip!" I became even angrier upon hearing his words. I suddenly stood up and shouted, "Are you saying that you will continue to contact Jezebel while Paige is pregnant? Considering that Paige is pregnant, I will keep this from her. If you continue like this, I will immediately tell Paige everything. Don't blame me by then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rage burned in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't so furious when I found out that Giselle was pregnant with Elliott's child. Right now, I was trembling with anger because of Philip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked at me, terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly took my hand and whispered, "Madeline, calm down. Philip shouldn't have done that, but don't tell Paige about this. Paige is coming back soon. Let's just drop it for now. Otherwise, if she..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn wanted to persuade me. Just at that moment, the door of the room was suddenly pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Paige stormed in angrily, with her big belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard everything you said. What are you hiding from me? What is it that I shouldn't know? Philip, did you do something discreditable that you don't want me to know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We didn't expect Paige to come back so soon. She overheard our conversation just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed toward Philip without hesitation. Then, she grabbed his ear. Before Philip could say anything, she burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip, you are a heartless bastard. Because of you, I got pregnant at such a young age. Now I've become fat and ugly. I can't sleep well at night and feel tired during the day. I suffered all kinds of hardships, while you were flirting with another woman. How could you do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was not a pushover. When she found out that Philip had betrayed her, she couldn't easily let him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't control herself and started crying out. Paige pinched Philip's ears hard, getting angrier and angrier. Suddenly, she picked up a glass of cola from the table and </span><span>poured it over his head without hesitation.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="600.html">« Prev</a><a href="602.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
