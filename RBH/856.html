How on earth did she find our place?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know, she's out there with two guys, banging on the door, saying she wants to come in and talk. Madeline, you need to get back here, pronto!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mom said anxiously."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'm coming back right away! Mom, whatever you do, don't open the door! Under no circumstances should she see the child!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hung up the phone and bolted to my car, driving straight out of the private vineyard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was speeding all the way. Along the road, Elliott kept calling me, but I just didn't have the mind to answer his calls.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, I found myself at my front door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Laura was at the door, flanked by two towering bodyguards clad in black suits.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't open the door, it just proves you've got something to hide! Why else wouldn't you let me see what the kid looks like? If he doesn't resemble my Elliott, but looks like Quinn Woods instead, I promise I won't bother you again!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was pounding on the door, a picture of impatience.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing this scene, my heart instantly felt as if it was set ablaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm not sure how she managed to track me down, but it's clear that after seeing my folks with a kid that day, she must've done some digging on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has she forgotten how she treated me when Giselle Cole was pregnant? How she mocked me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I parked the car, hopped out, and walked over to her, pulling her out without a second thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, what the hell are you doing? This is my place, get out now or I'm calling the cops for trespassing!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calling the cops would be even better! Once they're here, I'll tell them how you're hiding my grandson from me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, Laura shrugged off my hand, speaking with a defiant air. The look of certainty on her face was as if she already knew the identity of the child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your grandson? Isn't your grandson always in the incubator? The one Giselle Cole gave birth to, that's your grandson. There's no grandson of yours here!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but remark with biting sarcasm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I hadn't brought it up, it seemed as if Laura had completely forgotten about the child's existence. As if I had mentioned something terribly unlucky, she awkwardly said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of incubator? That little bastard has no connection with the Bryant family! Madeline, can you let me see the kid? After all, you and Elliott are back together now. If the kid is Elliott's, wouldn't that be perfect? You two can start over again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Get back together? She sure makes it sound easy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If all the emotions in this world could be simply switched on and off, there wouldn't be such a long history of grudges and reconciliations.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I let out a cold chuckle, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no chance of your son and I getting back together. As for the child, like I said, it has nothing to do with the Bryant family. I understand your longing for a grandchild. You could encourage your son to have more children while he's still young. Besides... even if your son isn't willing, there are other ways, aren't there? In vitro fertilization is always an option. I'm sure there are plenty of women who'd be willing to have your son's child."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately dished out sarcasm, but to my surprise, Laura mistook it for genuine advice. She even let out a sigh, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I don't want to? But my foolish son, his heart is all yours, and you know it. Besides, IVF isn't a sure thing. Giselle dares to conspire with the doctor to deceive me with a bastard who has nothing to do with the Bryant family? Who knows what other women might pull."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="855.html">« Prev</a><a href="857.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
