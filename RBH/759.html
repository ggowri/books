Then, he fished out his phone from his pocket. Suddenly, he shot a link to my phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, the link I'm sending you contains some monologues that Mr. Bryant anonymously posted on a website. I stumbled upon them while searching for information on his computer. Take a look, you might find some answers there. Take care and I'll await your call."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Barry rose to his feet, gave me a respectful bow, bid me farewell, and left the hospital room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had Barry left than Quinn rushed into the room, his eyes wide with panic as he looked at me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry's looking for you, isn't he? Wants you to meet Elliott, right? What's your take on this, Madeline?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's concern for me was glaringly obvious, I could feel it in my bones. I nodded slightly, letting out a soft sigh:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he said Elliott's been unconscious, maybe if I talk to him, he'll get better. Quinn, Elliott saved me that day, didn't he?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I locked eyes with Quinn, questioning him. I needed to be sure, was he deceiving me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Quinn's eyes were clear, he didn't shy away from my gaze:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, there was no sign of him, at least not when I was there. Madeline, if he had been there, I wouldn't lie to you. I'm just not that kind of person."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's words once again validated my trust in his character, immediately putting me at ease. Then, I softly said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, he was there, he was the first one on the scene before you guys showed up. But by the time you got there, he was outnumbered, they pushed him down the hillside. That's why you didn't find him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth I revealed sent a shiver down Quinn's spine. He looked at me, his eyes wide with disbelief:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can this be? You're telling me he went there alone? That's not like Elliott, he's not the type to take such risks."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn echoed my question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I relayed everything Barry had just told me to Quinn, word for word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time I finished recounting everything, the shock on Quinn's face mirrored my own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He too fell into a prolonged silence, seemingly an eternity passed before he seemed to accept the reality. Finally, he murmured softly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it seems... he loves you more than I ever imagined."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But how can you be so sure that he's doing this out of love? Maybe he just feels guilty for not treating me well in the past and is trying to make up for it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guilt is love, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't see that coming," Quinn blurted out. The words that followed left me utterly astounded:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Love is often a feeling of indebtedness. It's this sense of owing that makes us want to be better for the other person; it's this sense of owing that fills us with guilt for not doing enough; and it's this sense of owing that makes us feel that no matter how much we do for the other person, it's never enough. This is the love of parents, the love between lovers. Isn't it the same for you and me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Love often feels like a debt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence struck me like a bolt of lightning, piercing my heart with a pain so profound.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="758.html">« Prev</a><a href="760.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
