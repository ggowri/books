It was probably the time for him and Sylvia to come to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sylvia, I'll be honest with you. Even without the rumors between you and Elliott, I wouldn't have considered you. However, since you're being sincere today, I can consider paying attention to a suitable role for you. I'll contact you when the time comes. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I originally didn't want to give Sylvia any chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when I thought about the story that Elliott and Giselle were about to experience next, I suddenly felt that instead of having one more enemy, it would be better to have one more ally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe one day, on the long and arduous journey of breaking up Elliott and Giselle, I might just need someone like this to cooperate with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Sylvia heard me say this, she appeared very disappointed. Afterward, she stood up and sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. But I really liked the female lead. This book is also my favorite among all the novels I have read. Ms. Mayers, if you change your mind, please feel free to contact me anytime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded. My conversation with Sylvia came to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Sylvia left, I opened the stack of materials that Adam had given me. Suddenly, among the various documents, I discovered the existence of a girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This girl is named Audrey Carter. She is 22 years old this year. According to the information, she graduated from a vocational school. She has been working as an extra in the film and television city. She has played some unknown small roles. However, she has a remarkable appearance. She has a small round face. When she smiles, her eyes curve like a crescent moon. She looks very innocent, but there is a sense of resilience in her eyes, as if she has experienced hardships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason I noticed her was because I knew in the previous life, this girl would become popular all over the country two years later due to a TV drama. Since then, her career has been very successful. Afterward, she also played many popular roles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, this actress was still an unknown small actress. So, her information was placed at the bottom by Adam. But I became interested right away, and I immediately called Adam in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, did you look for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Adam came in, he quickly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I extracted Audrey's information and handed it to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You called and made an appointment for this girl to come for an audition tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam took the documents. Then, he paused for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her? Madeline, are you sure? She's just an unknown actress. Besides her somewhat innocent appearance, she doesn't have any advantages. And she has a round face, she shouldn't be able to play the lead in this play, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had my plan. You should invite her for an audition first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, no problem. I will arrange it right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam didn't say anything more. He immediately responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Adam left, I busied myself for a while. Suddenly, my mom called me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, once you finish your work today, please go home early. Today is Thanksgiving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah? Is today Thanksgiving? It came so quickly--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If my mom hadn't said anything, I wouldn't have known that Thanksgiving had already arrived. I looked at the calendar again, and indeed, today is Thanksgiving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Mom. I'll be right back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, I hung up the phone. Immediately, I picked up my bag and left the office. I immediately drove to the mall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I was an irresponsible daughter. During holidays and special occasions, I rarely went back home to accompany my parents. I never even thought about buying them any gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my previous life, I had already vowed to be a filial child. Just like other daughters do for their parents, I will also provide everything for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ran to the jewelry counter in the mall and picked out a gemstone bracelet that my mom usually likes. Afterward, I also saw another bracelet made entirely of emeralds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since today was Thanksgiving, I bought a bracelet for my mom, so I decided to buy a gift for Laura too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I directly asked the shop assistant to pack one for me. Afterward, I went to the imported premium cigar store and bought a box of top-quality cigars for my father and Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, I called the driver Toby to help me deliver the cigars and the gemstone bracelet to the Bryant Villa. Meanwhile, I carried the gifts back home myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I went back, my dad was already in the kitchen cooking with my mom.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="73.html">« Prev</a><a href="75.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
