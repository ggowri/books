Suddenly, he rose, gripping my hand, intent on taking me home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Home? Which home are we talking about?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze. Suddenly, it dawned on me. Elliott had woken up, but he had lost his memory.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he be so extraordinary?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this thought, my eyes widened in alarm. As he rose to leave the hospital room, I hastily grabbed his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, where are you off to? You've just woken up. Your body still needs healing, it won't recover that quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been by his side these past few days. Aside from the doctors, I know his condition better than anyone else.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack stated that even after waking up, he'd need to spend some time in the hospital. His internal injuries were pretty severe, and he couldn't move around freely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned to me, his face a picture of innocence:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Babe, what are you talking about? I'm as fit as a fiddle, just yesterday we went hiking together. If you don't believe me, I'll prove it to you tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He winked at me, a mischievous grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His demeanor was as if we had never been apart. As he spoke, he affectionately held my hand, our fingers interlaced. His fingers gently threaded through each gap of mine, tenderly caressing my hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's been a while since I've felt this kind of intimacy and ambiguity. Suddenly, I found myself blushing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gaped at him, forced to shift gears in the conversation:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're hurt, we're at the hospital now. You lay there, I'll go fetch the doctor. If the doc says you're okay, we'll head back home, alright?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll take your word for it. But it's strange, how did I end up in a hospital all of a sudden?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott muttered to himself before settling back onto the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to his lingering weakness, he was out like a light within seconds of lying down, his even breaths suggesting he had drifted back into slumber.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him in this state sent a wave of panic through me. I rushed to Jack's office, recounting the recent exchange between Elliott and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Mr. Bryant took a tumble down the hillside, he hit his head pretty hard. There's a clot in his brain now. Given the intricate nature of the neural system, we're hesitant to perform surgery just yet. This might be the reason for his scrambled memories, a case of selective amnesia."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing my story, Jack responded with a serious tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was slightly taken aback:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? He really lost his memory? So, what do we do now with his current situation?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll just have to accommodate him. Don't attempt to wake him up. If he gets agitated, it could cause a shift in the blood clot in his brain, which could potentially be life-threatening."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack stated truthfully.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? I'm supposed to play along with him? But his memory is stuck pre-divorce. So, you're telling me I have to pretend to be his wife again?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was totally blindsided, utterly taken aback. I felt a mix of reluctance and discomfort, completely at a loss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was in the middle of a conversation with Jack when Barry abruptly rapped on the door of Jack's office, turning to me, he said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, Mr. Bryant's awake and he's been calling your name. He keeps asking to go home. You should go see him."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="776.html">« Prev</a><a href="778.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
