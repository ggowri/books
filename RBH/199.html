Not only did he come to visit, but he also arranged a gourmet meal for lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was somewhat speechless, even though the money was not mine, but I felt a bit sorry for it. "Why do you have to be so extravagant? There are nearly two to three hundred people in my crew, and you have given it all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott nodded with a smile. "Hmm, I booked three hundred copies, should be enough, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's generosity, in the end, followed Laura. I heard him say this, so I stopped saying anything more and immediately called Adam over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was still a little shaken at this point. He was serious and didn't dare to joke with me as he usually did. "Madeline, what's wrong? If you need anything, just let me know, and I'll take care of it right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I pointed at the boxed meals that had just been delivered and said to Adam, 'Send a few people to deliver these boxed meals to the workers at the nearby construction site.'"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah? Then what are we going to eat?" Adam was stunned and quickly asked in a perplexed manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott ordered the set menu from the Royal Taste for everyone, and it was delivered shortly after. Please inform everyone that he is treating us to lunch." I said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I finished speaking, the Royal Taste's uniformed waiters came in, each holding several large meal boxes, and placed them in the empty space of the crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam looked at everything and immediately understood. So, he quickly took the megaphone from a staff member's hand and shouted loudly, "Elliott invites everyone to have a meal at The Royal Taste for lunch. Let's put our work aside for now and come quickly to dine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Adam shouted, everyone noticed this side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reputation of The Royal Taste was well-known in Louis City. For a moment, everyone couldn't help but cheer, and no one knew who started shouting "Long live Elliott". Suddenly, everyone started shouting along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched everyone cheering and jumping with excitement, and couldn't help but turn my head to look at Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, I was quite surprised that he did that, especially since we hadn't been in touch at all for the past two weeks, not even a phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no way of knowing what his motive was for doing this, I only felt my hand being held so tightly that it was sweaty, but despite that, he still didn't let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was quite considerate in his thinking. Not only did he order food for everyone, but he also ordered milk tea for the entire crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The film crew usually demands cost-saving measures, even the cost of boxed meals is under control. It's not easy for everyone to have such a feast, and instantly, a strong joy is seen on everyone's faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam had probably snapped out of his shock and took two servings of food. He led me and Elliott to the conference room and let the two of us dine alone in the production team's meeting room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was indeed a little hungry, so I sat down and immediately opened the exquisite lunch box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is indeed a set meal priced at over 30 dollars. As soon as it is opened, the rich aroma of the ingredients immediately fills the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dishes in this lunch box, although not many, were all made from expensive ingredients. There were fish maw, sea cucumber, crab roe, as well as foie gras, abalone, and sashimi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was very surprised when I saw it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Elliott had already sat down beside me and seeing that I hadn't touched my fork, he thought I didn't like it. So he softly said, "Is it not to your taste? Or should I take you out to eat instead?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="198.html">« Prev</a><a href="200.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
