That's why my mother is so convinced the child Giselle is carrying is mine. Because it was all orchestrated by them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott finally revealed the facts he had uncovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, these facts were brutal for him to disclose. That was why he took so long to tell me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was instantly stunned. I stared blankly at Elliott, so shocked I forgot to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never imagined that Cormac, Laura, and Jasper had started their covert actions back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nor did I expect Giselle, an unmarried woman, to choose such a painful method as IVF for the sake of carrying on the Bryant family legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was genuinely prepared to pay any price to marry into the Bryant family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My emotions, which had been stable, surged unexpectedly upon hearing the truth Elliott revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed then that even if Elliott and Giselle hadn't had sex before, the child Giselle was carrying was undoubtedly his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, I successfully fended off Elliott's advances. Yet, this revelation shattered me in an instant, bringing me to the brink of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I congratulate you? Elliott, your wish to become a father has finally come true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared intently into his eyes, my heart breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline," Elliott murmured, "I know this truth is a tremendous blow to you. That's why I've been debating whether to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean you've known about this all along?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I struggled to control my emotions, but my tone was unavoidably angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pressed Doctor Louis for answers and found a breakthrough. I only uncovered the truth recently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott spoke slowly, his tone incredibly somber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning weakly against the wall, I felt utterly drained. Unbidden, the image of the ultrasound Giselle had sent me surfaced in my mind, showing the tiny shape of the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like a dagger had pierced my heart, cutting straight through and leaving a trail of imaginary blood flowing through my veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine. You don't have to worry about your grandfather's regrets. The Bryant family won't be lacking descendants. It's okay, I can step aside for her anytime. Just set a date, and we can get the divorce papers sorted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, I slowly closed my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no longer any need for me to entangle myself with him or with Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing Cormac, Laura, and Jasper as I did, the child Giselle was carrying was a massive joy for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was now a hero in their eyes. No wonder Laura didn't bother to pretend anymore. She was eager to get me out of the Bryant family sooner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I don't want to divorce you. Madeline, I can't be without you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned deeply. Hearing my words, he nervously grabbed my icy hand and placed it against his burning chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart was pounding fiercely, and his eyes reddened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could see the plea in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His desire to avoid divorce was so clear. Yet, I found everything absurdly ridiculous. I forcefully pulled my hand away, trying to organize my thoughts, which were already a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not get a divorce? Is that realistic? Elliott, after what the Bryant family has done, I have no choice but to facilitate this for you! After all, I'm the hen who can't lay eggs in your eyes," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I let out a bitter, sarcastic laugh, even though my heart felt like it was bleeding.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="433.html">« Prev</a><a href="435.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
