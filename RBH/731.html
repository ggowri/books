Finally, he found Dehan's phone number and dialed it right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Dehan was on official duty or for some other reason, Marcus called his phone three times in a row, but he didn't answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as everyone's mood was starting to become depressed again, Dehan finally returned Marcus's call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello? May I ask who is speaking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Dehan? I am Marcus, your comrade. Do you remember me?" Marcus asked excitedly over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... it's you, why did you suddenly call me? I was busy with some official matters just now and didn't have my phone with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she heard that it was Marcus, Dehan let out a hearty and gentle laugh on the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dehan, I have something very important and urgent that I need your help with. Are </span><span>you available to talk now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, you could say--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Marcus hurriedly called his comrade named Dehan and informed him about everything that had happened to us so far. As he spoke, all of us sat on the side, holding our breath, waiting for Dehan's response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed by minute by minute, and the thought of Quinn being soaked in that filthy water dungeon, forced to be with hundreds of little snakes, made me tremble and feel uncomfortable all over my body. I wished I could immediately rescue him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you came to the right person when you asked me for help! Tell your friend not to worry, now that we know the situation, we will definitely assist you guys! We will do everything in our power to follow up on this matter, ensuring your personal safety, and rescuing your companion as soon as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dehan listened to us explaining all the situations, he immediately spoke into the phone to make an identification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was truly a soldier, every word he said was so strong and powerful, instantly giving me hope when I had just felt helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly took the phone from Marcus and said into it, "Mr. Rethe, thank you so much! However, they warned us not to call the police, otherwise they would kill Quinn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are the border troops, they cannot keep track of us, don't worry. Tomorrow, you follow the instructions of the other party first, and I will secretly arrange the other deployments. Also, send me the number that contacted you, I will have someone investigate her clues and find out as soon as possible who is behind the plot against you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dehan's words instantly relieved the tension in my previously anxious heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Marcus's comrades to be so capable, which made me greatly admire him. I raised my thumb toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, it's really fortunate to have a comrade like you on this side too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled. Seeing how worried I was, he patted my shoulder and comforted me, saying, "Since Dehan said so, it means he has some confidence. He has been stationed here for several years and has a lot of experience dealing with these matters. Don't worry too much, with their covert support, we should be able to rescue Quinn soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We discussed in Jane's room until late at night, and then we each returned to our own rooms to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because I was very scared of what happened in the room today, the waiter specially changed a room for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying goodbye to them, I already felt very sleepy. I yawned and walked along the corridor, following the waiter to the room I was going to change to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, a woman suddenly emerged from a room, dressed in a tight black long dress and wearing a black hat. Gracefully, she walked toward me and quickly passed by me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never paid attention to her before, but in that moment when she passed by me, I unintentionally glanced at half of her face under the hat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was this unintentional glance that startled me so much that my heart almost jumped out of my chest!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="730.html">« Prev</a><a href="732.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
