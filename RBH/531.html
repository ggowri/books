It's all true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Quinn finished speaking, I could feel Elliott trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With incomparable seriousness, he walked in the direction of Quinn and me step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, that's the reason behind your haste in seeking a divorce from me, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood before me and questioned me with a great wave of hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath. Well, since Elliott had heard our conversation, instead of denying it, I'd rather destroy his little love for me completely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gathered the courage to raise my head and look into Elliott's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn treats me better than you do. Anytime something happens to me, he's the first one there for me, but you just can't do that at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that said, I purposely held Quinn's hand right in front of Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn immediately grasped my thoughts and directly interlocked his fingers with mine, facing Elliott together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott visibly shook again and stumbled a little, almost losing his balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How ridiculous!" He rasped, and his voice was so cold that it seemed to come from hell. "These days, I can't figure out why you did this to me and why you became so ruthless. It turns out that it was because of him! So, Giselle's pregnancy was simply an excuse for divorce for you, wasn't it, Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glared at me with scarlet eyes. His furious look broke my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your family dislikes me because I couldn't conceive or bear a child. Perhaps we're just not meant to be. But why could I be pregnant with Quinn's baby? Elliott, have you thought about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately touched Elliott's sore spot, trying to give him back all the pain I had endured and suppressed these days, so that he, too, could experience this feeling of complete denial and betrayal.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words, undoubtedly, greatly insulted Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, with his eyes fixed on me, suffered a pang of incomparably greater intensity.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you mean you fell in love and even had sex? Madeline, how long have we been separated? Y-You betrayed me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Giselle who got pregnant first! You made love, and I followed suit! I told you a long time ago that I was no longer the humble, foolish, woman at your mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, I flew into a rage and yelled at Elliott without any semblance of guilt inside me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because I knew better than anyone else that I was innocent, it was Elliott and the Bryant family who bullied me and forced me to put up with all this when I should never have had to!&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stared at me closely for a long time before saying, "Madeline, it dawned on me today that I've never truly understood you until now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words, like a heavy hammer, hit me hard in my heart. I was aware that I realized that by provoking him like this, any chance of reconciliation was lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I didn't need him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some things, once set in motion, could not be stopped. Since I resolved to abandon our relationship, let's hurt each other utterly and mercilessly, lest there was still a connection between us. I had made up my mind.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="530.html">« Prev</a><a href="532.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
