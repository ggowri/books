I have matters to attend to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip impatiently pushed her away, gesturing for her to move aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he approached me with a pleading tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I know I messed up. Please, I beg you, don't tell Paige about this. She's pregnant now, and her emotions are already unstable. If she finds out, it'll surely lead to a big argument between us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you know she'll be upset, why do it in the first place? Philip, I thought you chose Paige, a turning point for you. But I never expect you to still do such a thing. I have to tell Paige. She still has a choice, and the child hasn't been born yet. If I let you continue deceiving her, her life might be ruined forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Philip, feeling utterly disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, as Paige's best friend, I had to inform her of this matter and let her make her own decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, if she found out after the child was born that Philip wasn't a good person, it would be too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, I pulled out my phone and dialed Paige's number directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip grew increasingly frantic, rushing over, attempting to snatch the phone from my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held the phone high, dodging desperately, doing everything to prevent Philip from grabbing it. Unbeknownst to me, in the struggle, we had edged closer to the railing of the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't make that call! You can't say it, if you do, Paige will forever hate me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip, am I supposed to watch you deceive my best friend? I can't let her life be ruined by you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you out of your mind? This is between Paige and me, please don't interfere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I can't do that. Since I've seen it, I must intervene! I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of us fought fiercely for the phone, but how could I, a woman, match the strength of a 6-foot-tall man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the struggle, Philip pushed me towards the edge of the railing, his sole focus on seizing my phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he heard Paige's voice clearly on the phone, he panicked, suddenly shoving me forcefully outwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was caught off guard. By the time I reacted, I was plunging into the icy sea!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive wave engulfed me, submerging me completely. I struggled desperately, but memories of drowning in a past life flooded back like a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the water, I heard distant shouts of my name from the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I told myself inwardly, "I can't die! I can't! Not like in the past life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have a child inside me. I can't just lose my life like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driven by a fierce will to survive, I held my breath, slowly resurfacing from the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, in this life, learning from past mistakes, I had taken private swimming lessons. No longer the Madeline completely clueless in water, I managed to keep myself afloat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People on the deck continued calling out my name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sea was freezing. My body stiffened from the cold. I thought, "On this massive vessel with so many people, someone will surely come to rescue me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept mentally reinforcing my resolve. As I was nearing my breaking point, a small boat gradually approached me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="575.html">« Prev</a><a href="577.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
