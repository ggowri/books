Afterward, I added the lyrics of the song I heard on my way here. Nothing can stop your longing for freedom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did not slap Adam and Rowan's faces, but shortly after I posted it on Instagram, my long-dormant Instagram exploded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige once again insisted that I share my location, while Fiona relentlessly interrogated me about the identities of the two handsome guys across from us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn left a comment on my Instagram, saying that not inviting him to dinner was not a bad review. Surprisingly, Philip also left a comment, saying, "Your life is truly colorful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh as I watched this bunch of mischievous friends commenting so joyfully under my Instagram post.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just when I was feeling particularly happy, Giselle suddenly sent me a private message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her first words were surprisingly accusatory: "Madeline, is that Rowan across from you? You actually had dinner with Rowan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These sharp words made my happy heart instantly unhappy, and I typed a few words: "Yes, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly replied to me, "Why did you have dinner with Rowan? Did you do it on purpose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at the screen, the last few words in her speech made me even more unhappy. I replied, "I don't understand what you mean by 'intentional'."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle quickly sent another message, and it was a series of texts: "Were you intentionally getting close to my ex-boyfriend because you were unhappy that Elliott took me to the hospital? Did you post this Instagram deliberately to show me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a strong and assertive tone of declaring sovereignty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at this series of words and suddenly felt a kind of indescribable glare, and at this moment, Rowan's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the screen, his expression clearly changed, and then he immediately walked to the side to answer the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No need to say, it must have been Giselle who called.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam glanced at me and, until that moment, he still didn't understand what had happened. He thought I hadn't eaten enough and said to me, "Madeline, why are you staring? Eat a little more, this restaurant is authentic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart was already burning hot, I had no desire to eat anymore. I shook my head, indicating that I was already full.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, Rowan also returned, he sat down and looked at me with a troubled expression on his face. After a while, he stammered and asked me, "Madeline, did...did you know my girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't say that I knew her well, we weren't very familiar." Of course, I was reluctant to admit it, after all, I didn't want to get to know a third party who had interfered in my marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just now she called and said she saw you on Instagram, and she questioned me why I had dinner with you. I explained the reason, and she said she wanted to talk to you. Madeline, Giselle has a more aggressive temper, so if she says something she shouldn't, please don't stoop to her level." Rowan quickly explained, both his words and tone revealing his instinctive fear of Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Giselle had complete control over Rowan, otherwise, he wouldn't have been like a mouse seeing a cat when she called him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan had just finished speaking when, as expected, Giselle sent another message: "Rowan said you introduced him to his lawyer job, Madeline. I had no idea you knew my boyfriend so early. I'm truly surprised."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="192.html">« Prev</a><a href="194.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
