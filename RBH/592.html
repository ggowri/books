Why did you ask me to pick you up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, visibly annoyed, retorted, "He knows nothing. I asked him to accompany me for the check-up, but he just gets on my nerves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip interjected calmly, "Paige, you forgot your water bottle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, right, I'll go get it." Paige suddenly remembered, turning back to retrieve it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only Philip and I were left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately pulled me aside, speaking in a low voice, "I truly am sorry for that day. It wasn't intentional, and I'm grateful Quinn arrived in time. I apologize..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I looked at him, my anger towards him softened slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine, luckily I'm okay. Let's put that behind us. But you and Jezebel..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could finish my sentence, Philip quickly glanced around, then glanced at me, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jezebel and I were just fooling around, nothing serious. I assure you, there will be no further contact. We've agreed to hold the wedding immediately after Paige gives birth. Madeline, can you keep this between us? Please don't tell Paige."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "So, that is his true motive for diverting Paige and speaking with me privately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must have feared I would disclose what I saw on the yacht to Paige."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Philip, unsure of what to say. As Paige emerged with the water bottle, Philip and I shifted our focus, pretending as if nothing had transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you two talking about? I've got my bottle. Madeline, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing much, just chatted casually. Honey, be careful on your way, if anything happens at the hospital, please call me immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip promptly approached Paige, planting a kiss on her cheek with a hint of indulgence in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wondered, "Can a man disguise himself so completely?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of inexplicable disgust welled up within me. However, I chose to remain silent, driving away with Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On our way, Paige and I engaged in conversation. "Madeline, my family is discussing the wedding date with Philip's parents. My parents plan to provide 500 million dollars for my marriage, with a 5% stake in our family business allocated to me, the rest going to my brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was familiar with Paige's family background. Like my own parents, hers had been deeply involved in the business for years, focusing on landscaping and nursery services, establishing themselves as leaders in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but think, "Could it be that Philip's choice of Paige is influenced by her substantial assets?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="591.html">« Prev</a><a href="593.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
