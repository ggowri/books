Why aren't you resting yet?" I subconsciously thanked Elliott. I then took the late snacks from him and then sat down on one side of the corridor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just got off work and stopped by. Are you sure your dad doesn't need to be transferred?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned and looked around the somewhat dated hospital corridor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, your grandfather is in the Bryant Hospital. It wouldn't be good for my family to be in and out of there at that time. After all, times are different now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said as I opened the box. The burger exuded a beef flavor, which smelled really good and looked delicious at this late night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I did not eat a lot of these things, I did not reject them. And since I didn't have any dinner, I nibbled on the burger while sipping a Coke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott naturally understood exactly what I meant by my words. He sat down next to me and said, "You don't have to pay any attention to what my parents and grandpa and the others think. I will persuade them."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott probably didn't realize that Laura had come to talk to me about divorce just today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't look up, just took a small bite of my burger. Then I said, "Well, I know. I haven't had the energy to think about divorce lately either. With my dad the way he is right now, there's a lot of stuff going on with the Glory Group that's still waiting to be dealt with. I hope you understand."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott could hear the detachment in my tone, and it made him a little upset. "Why do I get the feeling that you always treat me like an outsider? Now that we're married, your dad's business is my business too. I'm not going to leave it alone. Madeline, if there's anything you need from me you can talk to me. You don't have to beg for help."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like he still minded that I asked Quinn for help today instead of him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was true that it was easier for me to ask Quinn for help with a lot of things than it was for Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was because of the psychological shadow left by my last life when I was ignored by him for too long. Subconsciously, I was always afraid that if I took the initiative to ask for help with Elliott, he would once again reject me without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But naturally, I couldn't tell him that was the reason. I nodded and then deliberately changed the topic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This burger is pretty tasty. Would you like to try it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just ate it. This store has been open for many years and is located right near this hospital," Elliott replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked down and continued to finish my burger one bite at a time, followed by downing half of my Coke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't say anything more. However, he opened the fruit box after I finished my Coke and then handed it to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fruit was obviously freshly cut and looked very fresh. I ate a few pieces and felt full already.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going to keep watch all night, right?" Elliott asked me again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, or my mom will worry." I nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you just going to be here?" Elliott frowned and looked at the empty corridor, saying, "At night, it's cold in the corridor. The ICU doesn't need family members to watch either, so you should probably go home and sleep."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, and I'll take a break in Fiona's office later when I'm sleepy," I said with a small smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott saw that I insisted on staying here and understood that I was worried about Austin's safety. So he added, "Have you investigated the cause of the accident? Has the driver been caught now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, the driver fled the scene, and the police can't find where he is now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why didn't you tell me earlier?" Elliott frowned at that, "I'll get someone to look into the situation."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="303.html">« Prev</a><a href="305.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
