He's the Deputy Director of Bryant Hospital, a seasoned expert with years under his belt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm dead serious when I say this, he immediately noticed something was off. Without a second thought, he had the hospital room door shut tight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterwards, he meticulously conducted a comprehensive examination on Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the check-up, his expression was grave. He turned to me and asked:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, if we're going by what you just said, Mr. Bryant's reaction is indeed out of the ordinary. But I didn't spot any issues, are you sure about what you just told me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, you could have someone pull up the recent surveillance footage for review."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a slight nod.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack shot a glance at the person next to him. After a while, a technician from the hospital sauntered into the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held up his laptop, displaying the recent surveillance footage. The screen flickered to life, revealing the prior events between Elliott and me for all to see.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Experienced as he was, Jack instantly sensed something was off. He immediately lowered his voice, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although Mr. Bryant's recovery has been significantly faster than expected, he's far from being in such robust health. His unusual response is indeed out of the ordinary. I ask everyone present today to keep this confidential. I will get to the bottom of this as soon as possible and provide an explanation."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why has Elliott suddenly become like this? Dr. Jones, you must find out what's going on. What's happened to Elliott? He looks terrifying in the surveillance footage, as if he's possessed or something."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Laura finally noticed something off about Elliott. Elliott was her only son, and in her fear, she frantically grabbed Jack's shirt, bombarding him with questions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack and I locked eyes. Neither of us said a word, yet our silent exchange spoke volumes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack promptly asked:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has anyone other than family members been recently attending to Mr. Bryant in his hospital room?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's eyes immediately went wild:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The caregivers are all from your hospital, right? Oh, and there's this woman who's been with my son ever since we brought him back from Norch City. She's the one who saved his life. She claimed to be well-versed in medicine and insisted on staying to take care of Elliott until he recovers. I saw how professional she was when she massaged Elliott daily, so I agreed to let her stay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason Lisa stayed here was with Laura's permission.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's life was hanging by a thread. How could Laura be so nonchalant, entrusting him to the care of a stranger?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back on her past distrust and dissatisfaction towards me, and now seeing her so easily trust a stranger, I couldn't help but let out a cold, bitter laugh:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is utter nonsense! Do you even know who she is, what her background is? Elliott is seriously injured and unconscious right now. If she does anything to him in that hospital room, would you even know?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what are you implying? Are you suggesting that woman has ulterior motives?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura cried out instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not what I meant. I just feel that given his current situation, the people around him need to be trustworthy. Dr. Jones, I'm Elliott's ex-wife. I assume you're somewhat familiar with our history. Here's the deal, from now on until Elliott wakes up, I'll be the one taking care of him. No one else needs to be involved. If any of you have doubts about me, that's fine. I'm willing to be under 24-hour surveillance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I made the decision on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Elliott was seriously injured and unconscious because of me. I don't want him to encounter any more mishaps.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the recent bizarre situation gave me a creeping sense of foreboding. I fear that Laura could easily fall under that woman's spell again, and Barry is too young and inexperienced to handle it. Therefore, I'd rather take the burden upon myself and stay by Elliott's side. It's the safest bet.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="771.html">« Prev</a><a href="773.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
