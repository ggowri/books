I immediately took two steps back, keeping my distance from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you here for? Are you bored while staying with Giselle, so you came to harass me? Get out immediately! If you say these words to me again, I will report you for sexual harassment. Remember! You are my ex-husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott wanted to reach out and grab my shoulder, but upon seeing my resistance, he sadly withdrew his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said helplessly and wearily, "Madeline, have you been hating me so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," I admitted without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I was constantly reminiscing about the time we were in love. I know you're mad at me because of Giselle and the child. I didn't want these to happen. I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott wanted to defend himself. His low voice made me feel very unreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are looking for excuses to shirk responsibility. That child came into this world with your permission. Grandfather's illness is just your excuse. In short, it was you who wanted a child, and you thought I couldn't give birth to one. If you love me and want to be with me, you could have asked her to miscarry. But you didn't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I swallowed my saliva and spoke these words as quietly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought I didn't care about these things anymore. However, when I said these, I realized that my lips and body were trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that I still cared about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a hint of pain in Elliott's eyes. After I finished speaking, Elliott, who rarely showed emotions, suddenly burst into tears. He couldn't help but step forward and grab my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right, but not completely right. I could make her miscarry, but I can't do that. My grandfather raised me, and he was on a ventilator to sustain his life two months ago. The reason he has held on until now is to see my child. When he saw the photo of that child, his heart suddenly failed, and he is now in his final moments. The doctors say it's a miracle that he has held on until now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I heard this, my heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I looked up at him, his eyes were filled with tears. However, he probably didn't want me to see that, so he quickly turned around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he turned around to face me again, he had already returned to be calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what I should say. After all, life and death is a big deal. Moreover, it was his beloved grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott slowly continued, "If I could ignore all my family relationships and career to choose someone to love, Madeline, I would without hesitation choose you. However, reality is not like that. Besides loving you, I also have responsibilities to my family and career. If it were possible, I would gladly switch roles with you. You can ignore me arrogantly at any time, and I will faithfully please you. No matter how you push me away, I will not leave..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe that arrogant Elliott would say such words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing these words, I inexplicably felt shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never used to speak sweet words before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I thought what he said was wrong, and I couldn't help but mutter, "No need to switch roles. I am currently arrogantly ignoring you, and you are currently faithfully pleasing me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="610.html">« Prev</a><a href="612.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
