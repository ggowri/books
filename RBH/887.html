Once you've made a name for yourself, you become a topic of conversation, even if you don't utter a word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These folks usually carry themselves with an air of arrogance. They wouldn't bother to mingle with the common crowd, yet now, they're all reaching out, eager to make my acquaintance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I extended my hand, shaking each of theirs in turn, before Grey introduced me to the group. Then, the game was on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey pulled me into her squad, and together we hopped into a buggy, heading towards the field.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at me, her brows furrowed, and despite herself, she asked:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what's the deal with you and Elliott? Weren't you seeing Quinn?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to cause any more confusion, I explained to Grey about Elliott's injury and his current condition.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Grey had a sudden moment of clarity:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're just helping Elliott get better, right? That's good, just don't blur the lines, okay? Quinn is a one-woman man. Once he's chosen you, there's no turning back. If his heart gets broken, it's not something he can easily recover from."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, "Yeah, I got it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey patted my shoulder, noticing my slight despondency. With a smile, he said to me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, since you're here, just enjoy the game. These folks are the big shots of Hoswich City. Mingling with them will do you good."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After speaking, Grey quickly pulled me along to join the squad,"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I seldom play golf, but I've learned it before, so I haven't forgotten how to swing. After a few simple tries, I found my groove.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Grey, we pressed on. By the time we reached the third opening, a sudden burst of applause and gasps echoed from the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, I spotted a tall figure in white, skillfully swinging his club under the sun.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sun's warmth bathed him, dusting his slightly bronzed skin with a faint layer of gold. He wore a golf cap, obscuring his face from my view. Yet, even from his silhouette alone, I recognized him instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he showed up too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And believe it or not, he actually showed up wearing the same tracksuit as me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey caught sight of it too. She looked at Elliott, then at me, surprise etched on her face:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what's going on? I invited Elliott before, he clearly said he couldn't make it, so how...?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey instantly understood what was happening. A knot formed in her stomach as she quickly moved forward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a master at socializing, even if she didn't particularly like someone, she never let it show. With a warm smile, she would say:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, what brings you to the court today? We've invited you before, but you never showed up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Elliott took a swing. He looked dashing, utterly captivating as he played. His stroke was decisive, not a hint of hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ball soared far into the distance, tracing a beautiful arc in the sky. A collective gasp echoed from the crowd:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice shot! Mr. Bryant is so cool!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gave a slight nod, his gaze fixed on me from a distance. His lips curled into a subtle smile, and in his profound eyes, there was a deep-seated affection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll always stick with my wife. Otherwise, if someone snatches her away, I'd be heartbroken for life."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="886.html">« Prev</a><a href="888.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
