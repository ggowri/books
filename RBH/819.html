In that moment, the alcohol gave him enough courage to bellow out those words. I was taken aback by what I heard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've had similar suspicions in my mind. But I figured, the esteemed Dr. Jones wouldn't stoop so low as to collude with Elliott in spinning such a clumsy lie to deceive me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't be good if Quinn's words provoked Elliott and caused some unexpected incident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a frantic rush, I blurted out:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, what on earth are you blabbering about? You're drunk! Jane, help him back to his room to sleep it off!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Jane rushed forward, intending to support Quinn. However, Quinn brushed her off. After having a few drinks, he seemed intent on confronting Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward, locking eyes with Elliott, then said in an icy tone:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline hasn't loved you for a long time now. You should've noticed. You can chain her to your side with these dirty tricks, but you can't keep her heart. Elliott, do you find this amusing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face was a mask of shock. As if he'd been hit with a sledgehammer, his expression was blank, and he took a long time to recover. His voice instantly became despondent:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, what the hell are you talking about? Amnesia? Pretending? Madeline and I have never split up, we're still married! As for you, don't let the booze talk! I know you've had feelings for Madeline for a long time! I've been biting my tongue because we used to be good friends! But don't push it too far!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, cut the crap, will ya? We're both men here. You're gonna tell me you're not faking this amnesia? That it's not just some ploy to win Madeline back?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn locked eyes with Elliott, a defiant expression etched on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, enough! Dr. Jones wouldn't deceive me about this. Don't provoke him&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tugged at Quinn's sleeve, quickly whispering a reminder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you just say? What do you mean by 'ways to win Madeline back'? Pretending to have amnesia? Quinn, what the hell are you up to? Is Madeline's cold attitude towards me all because of your behind-the-scenes manipulation?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's emotions flared up in an instant. He was yelling at Quinn before I could even intervene. He had even grabbed Quinn by the collar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You play the part so well! But I know you, Elliott. Did you know Madeline was all set to get engaged to me? If it weren't for you, we'd be happily together by now, peacefully raising Noah, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was truly wasted. He even blurted out "Noah".</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You must understand, Noah is my Achilles' heel in front of Elliott! It's a secret I can't afford to let Elliott discover!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, before Quinn could finish his sentence, I cut him off with a loud shout:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! Both of you, enough! Can't you have a drink without making a spectacle of yourselves? Now, both of you, get to your rooms and sleep it off! Immediately, right now, or else, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Engaged? Madeline, you're getting engaged to Quinn? You... you..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Elliott was once again provoked by Quinn's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He released Quinn's collar in utter shock, instead seizing my arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me with an expression of extreme agony. Then, his brows furrowed deeply. Suddenly, clutching his head, he staggered back and forth a few steps.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood and collapsed right in front of us!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="818.html">« Prev</a><a href="820.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
