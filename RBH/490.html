She wore a red sweater, had a sweet smile, and seemed to have become the favorite of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People always say that mothers gain more love from others because of their pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I caressed my belly subconsciously, feeling a surge of bitterness in my heart. Quinn noticed something was wrong with me. He leaned over, took a look at my phone, and understood instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted my shoulder and comforted me softly, "Don't think too much, just look forward. Christmas means to bring about a new beginning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." I nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I uploaded the video of the fireworks I had just taken to Instagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Christmas means to bring new beginnings. Let everything related to the Bryant family stay in the past," I whispered to myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt down for a while, but I quickly adjusted my mood and started playing with them again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Lily was delighted. She didn't want to sleep and was busy in the kitchen alone. After a while, she took out a small and exquisite stove from the kitchen and some fruits she had prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This small stove was bought by your father and me at the flea market a few days ago. It's just right for making mulled wine," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily covered the small table next to us with a tablecloth and placed the small stove on it. Then, she put the fruit into the glass pot with wine and boiled it on the small stove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flame of the small stove warmed everyone's heart even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We drank the mulled wine and played cards until almost dawn. Then, we went to bed with some regrets as we had not played enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was late. In addition to my family's habits, Quinn and Marcus stayed in the guest room of my house that night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early the following day, Lily cooked breakfast and woke us all up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Lily, she treated Marcus and Quinn as her children. Not only did she thoughtfully prepare toothbrushes and toothpaste for them, but she also gave each of them a Christmas present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, you are the best! The last time I received a Christmas present was when I was 18 years old, and no one treated me as a child anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn did not expect Lily to prepare a gift for him, so he excitedly gave her a big hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are luckier than me. I rarely received Christmas present when I was a child because my family lived in different places and rarely got together to celebrate Christmas. Lily, you are so kind! Merry Christmas, and thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus also expressed his heartfelt gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are all Madeline's friends, so I treat you as my own children. You can always tell we whatever you want to eat. I has no other advantages, except that I like to cook!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked at the two young men and loved them from the bottom of her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, I won't refuse. My mom rarely cooks, so if I want to eat home-cooked food in the future, I'll come over to eat!" Quinn laughed and said immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I live nearby. They say that living close can bring more benefits. Count me in for a good food from now on," Marcus also said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Christmas, after all. Everyone's face was filled with joyful smiles involuntarily. Their smiles also infected me, so I joked, "You can't eat for free. I need to charge you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled brightly, pointed at my belly, and said, "Don't worry, we won't eat and drink for free. After the baby in your belly is born, I will buy his milk powder and diapers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, I will be responsible for his toys and clothes," Marcus immediately said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, why do I find that every time I say something, you have to compete with me? Do you want to steal my godfather's position from me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="489.html">« Prev</a><a href="491.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
