I pushed him away, turned around, and tried to leave the private room with my bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what I didn't expect was that just as I was about to leave, he suddenly grabbed my hand and his voice instantly turned much colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, that was not for you to decide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was more determined than ever before, and at the same time, I felt a piercing pain in my wrist as he tightly gripped it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you forcing me like this just to make Sylvia popular?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head and looked at him sadly, but I couldn't see any tenderness in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must fulfill my promise to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained resolute, as if I had never been his wife at all. He insulted my dignity with such certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, I no longer loved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, I would still be sad no matter how strong I was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more you care about her, the less likely I am to agree. Elliott, don't bother saying more to me. You can hire a lawyer to sue me if you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't need to continue acting with him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was afraid that if I stayed here any longer, I wouldn't be able to bear it and would end up showing my vulnerability in front of him just like before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed him away once again, forcefully prying open his hand that was tightly gripping my wrist, and rushed out of the private room in one breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ran to my car and prepared to open the door, but to my surprise, he chased after me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood in front of my car, staring at me with his deep, captivating eyes that had once fascinated me. He lowered his voice and asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you believe that if you dare to oppose me, I will suspend all projects with Glory Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How ridiculous...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he really forget that it was my family who provided crucial support during the most critical time, which led to the success of the Bryant Group today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the projects that the Bryant Group and Glory Group were currently working on were promised by Jasper before he stepped down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two families have been business partners for many years, and they were also relatives by marriage. There was no good in doing so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, just for a woman, he actually wanted to stop the project with Glory Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was very disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at the tall and mighty man in front of me. His eyes intimidated me, making me doubt even more what I had loved about him in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was there about him, such a cold-blooded and ruthless man, that was worth me sacrificing so much for him in the past?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not just Glory Group who can benefit from the projects between the Bryant Group and Glory Group. If you insist on stopping the projects, then I can't do anything about it. But I wonder how you will explain it to Jasper later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I still didn't understand much about business affairs, at least I knew one thing apart from the twenty billion dollars my family gave out, Jasper also saw the strength of Glory Group and chose to join forces with it, so there was an arranged marriage between Elliott and me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the current Glory Group had encountered some problems, it still looked prosperous. By no means Jasper would support Elliott's decision to break ties with my family at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you dare to threaten me?" Elliott grew even angrier upon hearing my words. "Madeline, you have truly become someone I cannot underestimate recently."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="27.html">« Prev</a><a href="29.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
