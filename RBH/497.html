Fortunately, I was wearing a mask, so I didn't have to worry about my face being caught by the camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat quietly among the crowd, gradually regaining my composure from uneasiness, and Elliott, who sat beside me, remained calm throughout. I couldn't even hear him breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid gossip, I didn't look at him, not even once. I watched ahead all the time, which inevitably caused my neck to stiffen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously turned and looked to the left frequently. I felt like the man sitting on my left, who was named Dalton Lewis, was familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I racked my brain to recall, and suddenly, I remembered that he was a well-known actor and later became a director. But, the first movie he shot was a sensitive subject matter, so nobody wanted to invest. In the end, in order to successfully shoot the movie, he mortgaged all his houses with the support of his wife and finally gathered enough money to produce the movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, after the movie was released, it became a dark horse at the film's box office, and he became famous throughout the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to time calculation, he should be in the process of transforming into a director now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The success of Do Not Love alleviated my financial problems. Next, if I could cooperate with that future famous director and help him when he needed it most, I would definitely be able to use his movie to make another fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that idea in mind, I subconsciously turned my head and glanced at him. Unexpectedly, he turned his head as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Our eyes met, and for a moment, we couldn't help but smile at each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suddenly remembered that you are a famous actor, right? I watched many drama series you starred in when I was a child." I took the initiative to strike up a conversation with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the moment I talked, I clearly felt that the "ice sculpture" on my right seemed to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, but I have rarely filmed drama series in the past few years. There are so many new stars emerging now. It's rare that you still remember me," Dalton said with a humble smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. I remember that the drama series you filmed in the past were all classics. According to today's standards, you were a well-deserved superstar at that time." I intend to befriend him. So, I said it deliberately to show my kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone liked others to appreciate them. Hearing my words, Dalton turned his head and looked at me specifically. Then, he smiled slightly and said, "Ma'am, judging from your temperament and appearance, are you also a star?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was complimenting me indirectly on my beauty. No woman didn't like the opposite sex to praise her beauty, and I chuckled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, my name is Madeline Mayers. This is my business card. It's nice to meet you," I said while taking my business card out of my handbag and handing it to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton took the business card. When he saw my title, he immediately said in surprise, "You are the current president of Glory Group. It's a pleasure to meet you. That very popular movie, Do Not Love, was invested by you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately handed me his business card, and we had a great time chatting and soon talking in depth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because we were at the venue, we could only talk in low voices, so we got increasingly closer to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as we were exchanging the phone number, Elliott, who sat on my right side, suddenly grabbed my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was concentrating on Dalton while we talked, and I didn't expect that Elliott would suddenly grab my hand. I was so shocked that my heart skipped a beat, and I turned my head and looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at me, his eyes clearly filled with anger. I instinctively wanted to break away from his grip, but he did not let go. Instead, he said to me coldly, "Come over, I have something to say to you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="496.html">« Prev</a><a href="498.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
