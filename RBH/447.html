And the moment I stood up, I clearly heard Giselle exclaim,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline? Madeline Bryant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona asked me in a hurry, so I had no time to pay attention to Giselle. I followed Fiona into the B ultrasonic room without any hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona had already told the doctor inside about my situation. After I entered the room, the doctor immediately asked me to lie down. And then, he began to examine me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the cold probe on my lower abdomen, I couldn't help feeling worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is the baby going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Fiona and the doctor showed serious expressions, so I became worried and nervous. Then, I couldn't help asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have just been pregnant not long ago. Now I can see the folk sac and the embryo bud, but the fetal heart is not obvious yet. It's strange. Theoretically, the embryo bud and the fetal heart should be detectable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crossing her arms in front of her chest, Fiona frowned at the screen. Obviously, she was unsatisfied with the current test results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah? What should I do? What will happen if the fetal heart cannot be detected?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt panic instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a first-time pregnant woman, it was the first time I heard these medical terms. And I had no idea what it meant not to be able to detect fetal heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some embryos implant late. It just develops later. Don't worry. You have to come back for a checkup in a week."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my worried expression, Fiona held my hand and said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. You are not alone. So, don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the doctor finished the examination. She handed me a tissue to wipe my belly. And then, she said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona helped me out of bed. Initially, I wanted to ask something else, but I suddenly saw Giselle's gloomy face appearing behind the small window on the door of the consulting room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought she must be wondering why I was here, so she wanted to see what I was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, after Fiona and I came in just now, she locked the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't expose my pregnancy to Giselle yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, I could predict that she would do something terrible for me with her character.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly pulled the curtain to cover myself. Then, I whispered to Fiona,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, I met Giselle in the waiting room just now. She would be bound to wonder why I received the B ultrasonic test. Maybe she will wait for me outside the door, so you hurry up to think of a way to cover it up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Fiona was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is that bitch here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just heard it that her attending doctor seems to work in this hospital. Fiona, is there any way to cover it up for me? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lie down. I'll ask my colleague to examine your chest. Since she knows a doctor working here, I'll delete the examination record later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing speaking, Fiona immediately asked me to lie down again. Then, she asked the doctor to examine me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, I took the test results, walking out of the B ultrasonic room with Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After coming out, I saw Giselle pacing restlessly in the corridor as expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the door open, she immediately turned and looked at me with sharp and some inquiry on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it's really you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at me intently, she shouted out in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Small world. It's me. So, what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at her and asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help looking me up and down. And then, noticing the test results in my hand, she immediately rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you here to check why you can't get pregnant? Actually, you should save your breath. Doctor Louis said that you can hardly get pregnant. So, stop daydreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, she subconsciously stroked her belly. Her silent action was clearly to stimulate me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="446.html">« Prev</a><a href="448.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
