A sense of unease filled my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Noah's distressed state, Lily shed tears of sorrow. My dad, while driving, kept asking about Noah's condition. Everyone was deeply concerned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The emergency room was surprisingly crowded, even in the dead of night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was due to the recent flu outbreak, but the emergency room was packed with patients and their families. The sound of coughs echoed through the room, punctuated by the occasional cries of children. My heart ached as I looked at little Noah.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott kept hitting my line, one call after another.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I reckon he must have just heard the sound of a child crying over the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, I couldn't care less about returning his call, let alone bother about what he might think.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly registered Noah, then followed the doctor's instructions to take him for a blood test. During the long wait, I paced back and forth in the hospital, cradling Noah in my arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wound on my arm had gone numb by now, and I couldn't care less if it was bleeding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I arrived in a rush, clad only in a thin knit shirt. The hospital's night wind made me shiver, but I no longer cared about my own comfort. My only fear was that Noah would catch a chill. I wished I could layer him with clothing, one piece after another.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood test results finally came in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Noah didn't catch a viral flu, but just a common bacterial infection. The doctor prescribed him some fever-reducing medication and asked us to monitor him at home after he took it. If the fever didn't subside, we were to bring him back to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After we got the medicine, we headed back home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a night of hustle and bustle, by the time we got home, the sky was already beginning to lighten.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though a nanny takes care of Noah every day, my parents are so invested in Noah that they're also worn out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, as soon as we got home, I sent them both off to rest in their rooms. Meanwhile, Malina, our nanny, and I stayed in the nursery to take care of Noah.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking the fever reducer, Noah gradually drifted into a peaceful sleep. His body temperature slowly dropped after drinking some milk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spent nearly the entire night awake, intermittently touching his forehead, taking his temperature, ensuring his fever had completely subsided. Only then could I breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day finally broke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malina stirred from her nap, noticing I was still awake. She quickly turned to me and said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, why don't you head to your room and get some rest? You've got work in the morning."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's alright, I'm not sleepy anymore. Noah's asleep now, you can rest a bit longer. I'll go grab us some breakfast."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I let out a yawn, struggling to get up. I returned to my room, throwing on a jacket. I planned to head out and grab breakfast for my family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a night of non-stop hustle, I was drained. Stepping out of the apartment complex, I found myself instinctively heading towards the breakfast joint.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, I found myself crashing into someone's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar scent enveloped me instantly, leaving me somewhat dazed. I thought I was just too tired and dreaming. However, when I lifted my head, I saw Elliott's face, his features crashing into my line of sight with startling clarity!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="898.html">« Prev</a><a href="900.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
