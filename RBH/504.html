Aren't they infringing upon it?" I asked in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The formula is the same, but the drug can be produced by different pharmaceutical companies as long as they obtain a drug production license. They are taking serious action this time, and the two companies are more powerful than us. I'm afraid they will bring the drug to market ahead of us," Marcus analyzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's words immediately reminded me of what Elliott had said to me that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he would not make any concessions to me in business this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would rather pay a higher price to cooperate directly with Ocean Pharmaceutical. Apparently, he was challenging me head-on. I knew this was a business competition. However, I couldn't help but feel sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said he loved me and couldn't get over me. Yet I was nothing for him compared to interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was fine. The crueler he was to me, the sooner I could move on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched Marcus and said, "It's okay. There will always be a solution. In any case, our drug will be marketed faster than theirs, and we can launch it before them. Besides, it's a big outbreak, and we can't just consider profits. I hope this drug can help more people recover quickly. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think so, too. I'm worried because Glory Group has invested a lot of money. If the profit doesn't meet our expectations, I'm afraid you will be stressed," Marcus looked at me and said sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. Any product has competitors. Even if there is no Bryant Group, there will be other companies. This is my choice. Even if I lose money, I will not go back on it. Just feel free to arrange production."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want Marcus to be hesitant at this time, so I decisively expressed my thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words eased Marcus's worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "Madeline, you are even more decisive than some men. Okay. I know what you think. Even if they join forces, I believe the drug produced under my supervision will never be worse than any other drug!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus patted his chest and instantly showed the heroic spirit of a soldier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! This is the Marcus I know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and patted him on his shoulder. We laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After talking to me, Marcus soon left my house. I walked him to the door. When I came back, I saw Austin sitting on the couch and giggling at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's smile was contagious, and I asked, "Dad, why are you giggling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, many men come to you every day. I'm very happy that you are so popular. That's my daughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad..." I blushed. "You misunderstood. We are just friends. As a father, you shouldn't make fun of your daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin laughed, his face wrinkled. Seeing me approaching and squatting beside him, he touched my head and smiled, "The way I see it, Quinn and Marcus have their own merits. They are both marriage material, at least much better than the cold Elliott. I have learned about the Woods family. It is very low-key in Hoswich, but it is an old noble family. It's large, united, and has strict discipline. Quinn is lively and helpful. He is really good. As for Marcus, he comes from a medical family and suits you. He is also reliable and has served in the military. In addition, he is very polite. I'm satisfied with them. You must seize the opportunity."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="503.html">« Prev</a><a href="505.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
