The sweat had long blurred the makeup on my face, and the bun on my head had also come undone, scattered messily on my shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deadly sorrow silently attacked me, and my heart continued to ache in waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memories of my past life trapped me like a nightmare, making it difficult for me to breathe. I slowly sat down on the ground, feeling like a lifeless corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few drunken young people were leaning on each other, swaying as they walked towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat on the ground, and I had no strength to move anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gradually approached me, and one young man, shirtless and with tattoos, stumbled towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beauty, were you drunk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked me frivolously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I weakly lifted my head, glanced at him, and then looked around. Elliott and his car were nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that he has completely given up on me and doesn't care at all whether I am alive or dead. He has left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized the danger and quickly supported myself with both hands, trying to stand up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But little did I know, this person suddenly stepped forward, pressing me against the wall. His hand brushed aside my disheveled hair and he grabbed my chin, saying:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a beautiful girl was actually abandoned on the street, did you break up with your boyfriend? Where is your home? Shall I take you back, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was truly speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott must be my destined misfortune, why is it that every time I am abandoned by him, I always encounter trashy people?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt an indescribable anger, so I directly spat at the man in front of me, and then I stood up and immediately wanted to walk forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! No sense of respect! He actually dared to spit at me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately cursed me fiercely behind me, and then he chased after me with his friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My physical strength had already started to recover, and I ran forward desperately. Fortunately, this group of people had been drinking and were already so drunk that they couldn't stand steadily, so their speed was not fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew the danger that would happen once they caught up with me, so I ran desperately towards the roadside, hoping that there would be an empty taxi available at this time. However, this road was unusually quiet tonight, not only were there no taxis, but there were also very few cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so angry that I couldn't help but want to swear. Just then, accidentally, I stepped on a piece of broken glass barefoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp pain shot up from the soles of my feet, causing me to bend over in agony. I discovered that my feet were already bleeding profusely, and the intense pain nearly made me faint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's really self-inflicted. At this moment, I have already awakened from that emotional loss of control, and I almost hate myself for not giving myself a slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened to me tonight? Why did I suddenly lose control like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I hadn't run out, I would have been lying in a comfortable bed sleeping now. Why on earth did I torture myself like this and put myself in danger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people saw me running towards the roadside. Initially, they had no intention of chasing me. However, when they saw me squatting down and no cars coming, they stumbled and ran towards me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was in a state of extreme anxiety, limping my way to the middle of the road. Fortunately, just at that moment, an off-road vehicle came driving from not far away.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="126.html">« Prev</a><a href="128.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
