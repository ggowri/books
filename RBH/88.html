You dressed like a powerful woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After we embraced, Fiona looked me up and down. Seeing me dressed in a professional suit, she couldn't help but compliment me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline is now focused on her career. I have invited her several times, but she never comes out," Paige said, holding my hand and smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was a career-oriented woman. Upon hearing Paige's words, she immediately said with satisfaction, "You are right. It is not beneficial for you to only care about that man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also laughed. Being with good friends is always enjoyable. I threw my bag onto the seat and asked them with a smile, "Stop teasing me. How have you been lately? We haven't seen each other for a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My motel is about to open soon, and the flower business has been doing well lately. Thanks to you, I have recently met a few handsome guys. After getting to know them, I don't feel as annoyed by them as before. To be honest, Quinn and Philip are cuter than before," Paige said, lying on the couch and smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was not surprised at all that she could get along with Quinn and Philip. They had a lot in common.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, every day I was either performing surgeries or practicing dissections in the laboratory. Others may find it boring, but I actually enjoy it. I love my work and I don't care about men," Fiona shrugged and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was a workaholic. She had decided to study medicine since she was young. Therefore, she chose to go to medical school without hesitation. She was the most ambitious among the three of us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she loved her work, she also enjoyed life. She was very independent and owned a 2,000-square-foot apartment, always living alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was loyal and had a boyfriend. However, her boyfriend went abroad two years ago and never came back. Although they didn't discuss breaking up, it didn't make much difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, her attention was focused on her work. So, she didn't feel sad. At least, she never showed any sadness in front of us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I developed a TV drama. We are currently casting and will start shooting soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also told them about my recent situation. Upon hearing my words, they were very interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to develop films and TV dramas? Madeline, really? You're amazing! Is the Glory Group planning to enter the film and television industry?" Paige immediately teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, give it a try. The Glory Group is also considering a transformation now. For me, it's also an opportunity," I said truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what you do, we support you, as long as you stop thinking about that man. How have you been getting along with Elliott lately? Has he been bullying you?" Fiona asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing special. I don't care about him anymore. You know our marriage was for a purpose, so I can't divorce him now. Paige, the Bryant Group needs a long-term flower supplier, and I recommended you. Have they contacted you?" I asked Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my words, Paige put down her fork, shook her head, and said, "I was just about to ask you about this. The Purchasing Department of the Bryant Group had contacted me before. We were about to sign a contract when they suddenly told me they found a more suitable supplier and that we could collaborate in the future. How could Elliott do this? I am your good friend. Why wouldn't he help me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="87.html">« Prev</a><a href="89.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
