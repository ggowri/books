I couldn't help but imagine Giselle standing here, spraying her perfume on every piece of my clothing, just as she stealthily took possession of my man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This covert intrusion made me angry and disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instantly tore down all the clothes from the closet and threw them on the floor. I didn't want any of them anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that lingering scent of perfume made me feel nauseous. My stomach churned with sickness, and I quickly bent over the trash can, vomiting uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott rushed into the walk-in closet quickly and upon seeing me vomiting heavily into the trash can, immediately came over to ask me with concern, "What's wrong? Madeline, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't eaten much last night, and with this vomiting, I almost vomited bile from my stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time I recovered, tears were already streaming down my face from vomiting so much, and I felt cold all over my body, like I would collapse any minute,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Elliott helped me up, my eyes were still blurred with tears. He quickly brought tissues to wipe the corners of my mouth and my teary eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My vision cleared up. With bloodshot eyes, I looked at Elliott, and I thought, at this moment, I must have looked like a desperate woman, as I shouted at him, "Elliott! Are you being too much? We haven't even divorced yet, and you let her into our bedroom, letting her spray perfume on my clothes? Is she a dog? Did she think that everything here belongs to her just because she left her scent here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but utter extremely harsh words because I had never encountered such shameless behavior before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott paused for a moment in confusion and asked me, "What perfume?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean appeared in our bedroom at some point. He probably heard the commotion just now and rushed in to see what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps overhearing our conversation, he walked over, trembling as he said in a low voice, "Mr. Bryant, just a few days ago, Mrs. Laura Bryant brought that... that Ms. Cole here again, saying she wanted to choose a room to decorate the baby's nursery. I stopped Ms. Cole from entering this room, but she insisted on coming in for a look. Mrs. Laura Bryant was also present, and I couldn't outright stop her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face darkened instantly, and at that moment, he directly yelled at Sean in front of me, "In the future, you must inform me of such matters immediately. And right now, you immediately have someone change the locks at Serenity Villa and prohibit anyone from giving the password to my mother! Otherwise, you can just stop working here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean, an elderly figure who had been working at the Bryant Villa for many years, had always been respected by Elliott as an elder. This was the first time Elliott had erupted in such fury towards Sean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean trembled in fear, immediately bowing and stammering, "Y-Yes, Mr. Bryant, I'll take care of it right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean left immediately, and at this moment, Elliott took out his phone and dialed Laura's number right in front of me. When the call connected, Laura cheerfully exclaimed on the other end, "Elliott, why are you so proactive in calling me today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott directly yelled into the phone, "Serenity Villa is mine and Madeline's home. If you dare to bring Giselle here without my permission again, I won't acknowledge you as my mother anymore!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="412.html">« Prev</a><a href="414.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
