On the way, Paige kept updating me on the progress of things through WhatsApp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She acted decisively and resolutely because this task was very last-minute and involved receiving important guests. The requirements for floral materials and the way of arranging flowers were both very particular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to save me from embarrassment, she made up her mind and moved all the newly cultivated white magnolia flowers from her nursery to the site. Since she couldn't find a truck at the last minute, she simply drove a large truck herself and set off directly. Then, she took her team to the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, with the cooperation of the Bryant Group employees, they quickly began to set up the venue, from the entrance of the Bryant Group all the way to the VIP conference room of the Bryant Group. Along the way, she adorned it with fresh flowers and had her florist specially arrange two sophisticated and elegant flower arrangements in the conference room, placing them respectively in the center of the room and on the podium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we led the Dikio delegation to the Bryant Group building, as soon as we entered, we were greeted by an extremely elegant floral scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw the flowers on both sides of the red carpet arranged in a very unique, elegant, and fresh manner. The colors of the flowers were simple yet stylish, giving a beautiful and sophisticated appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I divided our tasks, with him accompanying the main guests of the VIP group, and me taking care of the female companions. We chatted all the way along the red carpet to the conference room. Afterward, they began to negotiate business, while I led the female companions to the specially prepared lounge for them to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's thoughts were still delicate. Even in the lounge, she had the florist create a unique Western-style floral design. The women were full of praise and couldn't stop taking pictures of the flowers. It was evident that they were very satisfied with our arrangement this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't care about what specific business Elliott was negotiating with this delegation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I played a piano piece to entertain them, I considered my "political mission" completely accomplished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, I immediately slipped out and ran to the caf&eacute; in the Bryant Group building to meet Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was obviously tired. She was lying on the soft sofa in the caf&eacute;, allowing herself to sink into the plush cushions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of her was a large cup of American coffee, indicating that she urgently needed to replenish her energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling, you really worked hard today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ran over and gave her a big hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about it, are you satisfied with this arrangement? Did I not embarrass you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige also hugged me tightly and then asked with a cheerful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it was advanced and elegant, adorned just right. The key is that you managed to do it in such a short time. You truly deserve to be called my good friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but praise it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, for your reception this time, I have moved all the precious flowers from my nursery. They are all the ones I have worked hard to cultivate for a long time. If it weren't for you, I really wouldn't have the heart to do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, you know, I will tell Elliott later and ask him to give you guys more money. If it weren't for you this time, he wouldn't know how to end it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, speaking of which, just now your cooperation in the division of labor seemed quite like a couple. Madeline, have you recently been getting along well with him? Why do I feel like you two are not as distant as before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige put her arm around my shoulder, playfully pinched my face, and then asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We simply stopped arguing at most, there wasn't really anything worth arguing about. In the past, I cared too much about him and constantly bothered him. Now that I don't bother him anymore, things naturally became better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shrugged my shoulders and said lightly, avoiding the topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, it seems like your relationship was about to heat up. Too bad, I was looking forward to you getting divorced and traveling the world together!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="99.html">« Prev</a><a href="101.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
