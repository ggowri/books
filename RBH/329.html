He grabbed Quinn's collar and grumbled irritably, "I just got my hair done tonight, and you've messed it up with your beer. A simple sorry from you is enough?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn wasn't the type to tolerate someone grabbing his collar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed the guy's hair and said coldly, "I've already apologized. If you're still not satisfied, let me mess up your hair completely. Then I'll compensate you for the cost of your hairstyle, how about that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation instantly became tense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing things were escalating, I quickly walked over and tugged at Quinn's arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, don't be impulsive. It's not worth it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In all my time in Hoswich, no one has dared to grab my collar. Let's call it a day, considering your youth and lack of experience. Just a hairstyle, how about two thousand dollars?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn harshly grabbed the guy's hair again before reluctantly letting go. He took out his wallet and was about to pay the guy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man clearly didn't expect Quinn to be so generous. He wanted to protest further, but, seeing Quinn's imposing stature and strong demeanor, he dared not say another word and obediently took the cash.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle naturally noticed me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was first surprised, then stood up. It seemed she couldn't believe I was here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, though carefree, was extremely tactful. Knowing he had offended first, he nonchalantly paid up, then gestured for me to leave with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle and I involuntarily locked eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued to stare at me. The hostility in Giselle's eyes was palpable, even from a distance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shot her a disdainful glance. Despite the bombshell of information Giselle had just revealed in her conversation with her friends nearly shattering me, I refused to show any hint of sadness or despair in front of her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I called out coldly. "Waiter, the check."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I turned my head indifferently, no longer bothering to make eye contact with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter quickly approached. After tallying up the drinks and dishes on the table, we began settling the bill.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to turn and leave, to my utter surprise, Giselle suddenly called out to me from behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to admire her composure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite our unfriendly relationship, Giselle dared to call out my name so openly in front of so many people.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I halted my steps and slowly turned around. Staring at her indifferently, I asked in a tone devoid of emotion, "What's up? Need something?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Giselle swiftly pushed through the crowd and walked towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stopped right in front of me, then looked at me with a smug, almost eerie smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you following me? Otherwise, how coincidental that you're also here at this bar?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="328.html">« Prev</a><a href="330.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
