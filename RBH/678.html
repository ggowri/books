Elliott, it was you who betrayed her first! You are now just stirring up trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was truly infuriated this time. He looked at Elliott, who was usually gentle, and for the first time, he displayed a very fierce demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't! I had no involvement with Giselle from the beginning to the end! Madeline also knows exactly how things unfolded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glared at Quinn with anger in his eyes, his gaze sinister and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know since when, but the Elliott I knew seemed to have changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, when something is over, it's over. There's no point in bringing it up again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Elliott, my gaze calm and without a ripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said it's not over, so it's not over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott let out a cold laugh. His gaze made me shiver all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were not like this before..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him and felt tired in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott approached me gradually, "Wasn't it you who made me like this? In the past, you begged me to care about you. Now that you have achieved your goal, you are suddenly with someone else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively stepped back. This kind of Elliott, it made a slight fear arise in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was you who chose Giselle. It was you who got engaged to her and ended up together. If it wasn't for me uncovering Giselle's true face, you would have been together long ago. So, Elliott, don't make excuses for yourself, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned, "It wasn't my choice to be with her. It was her sudden way of having my child. And on top of that, my grandfather's condition worsened. I had no choice but to do that. Madeline, weren't you not very understanding before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding and empathizing with others...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, I used to be so understanding. No matter how cold Elliott was toward me, flirting with other women right in front of me, not caring about me, I could always love him consistently and treat him well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't know that behind my understanding nature, there were countless grievances I had swallowed and countless tears I had shed in the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I no longer wanted to be that understanding woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Elliott, while my gaze and tone were both cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You also said, that was in the past. A cooled heart is not so easily able to return to the </span><span>way it was before. I said, it can't go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing is irretrievable, as long as we want to go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott supported my shoulders. He looked at me with intense anticipation in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, however, directly pushed his hand away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, Madeline has already made herself very clear. Now, please leave here, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what happened in the past, Quinn would always save face for Elliott. After all, they were brothers who grew up together. He never once thought about really falling out with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, through Quinn's tone, I could feel that Quinn had reached the edge of patience. There was a strong anger restrained in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I could go. Madeline, you come with me. I'll take you to a place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pulled my hand, still with that superior attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, there was really no need to continue this entanglement. Don't you think you were being shameless by acting like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him, feeling an indescribable fatigue in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott seemed to not care at all about my thoughts. He became stubborn and crazy, forcefully grabbing my hand and pulling it so hard that my wrist turned bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I warned you, if you don't let go, I won't be polite anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was furious and could no longer control himself, so he grabbed Elliott's collar directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, only glanced at him sideways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I would love to see how you would do it!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="677.html">« Prev</a><a href="679.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
