Spare me the innocent act! Our marriage crumbled because you found a new partner first! As for this motor, it was your price increase that led me to consider severing ties! Little did I know you had such a knack for shifting blame back onto others!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I became agitated, Elliott unexpectedly lifted my chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes fixated on my red lips, concealing emotions I couldn't decipher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've explained countless times, the incident with Giselle's pregnancy, I truly was unaware at first. I find it hard to accept the accusation of betrayal. As for the price hike on the motors, I never gave such an order. As an upright CEO, I wouldn't concern myself with such trivial matters. Now that you stand in a position similar to mine, you should understand my predicament..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just making excuses for yourself!" I didn't want to hear his explanations. "Elliott, arguing about this is pointless. I'm here to inform you that our partnership ends here. I hope you cooperate with Glory Group's separation plan. From now on, we have no further ties!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words spoken, I rose to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott gripped the chair's armrests tightly, trapping me in this small cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought you had something important to discuss with me. Turns out, you're only here to say these things..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me, a hint of sadness in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this point, what else is there to say between us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gazed back at him with a touch of irony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "You're dead set on being with Quinn, aren't you? No matter how hard I try, it's beyond salvaging, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly cupped my face, a hint of reluctance in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt communication between us becoming increasingly difficult. He always evaded my words, harping on about trivial matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spoke coldly once more, "My future and who I'm with, the kind of life I lead, are my own affairs. Soon, we'll become strangers with no intersection in each other's lives, won't we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me, somewhat incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you erase all those deep emotions from your diary, all the feelings you once had for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled, realizing that the tumultuous feelings were long gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Love had faded, and reminiscing only made me see how naive I was. I dedicated years of my youth to an idealized man, only to end up like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have erased them, Elliott," I said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Then I'll leave a lasting mark on your life once again. I refuse to believe that anyone can replace me in your heart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected his gaze to turn fierce. Without warning, he fiercely bit my lip.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="586.html">« Prev</a><a href="588.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
