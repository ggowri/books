I said, I also have conditions, I must see Quinn before handing over the money to you. We give you the money, you release Quinn at the same time, otherwise, I will return with this ten million dollars in cash." I said calmly into the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, before we set off, we carefully studied the terrain of Ruini and familiarized ourselves with several routes in advance. In addition, with Dehan's people secretly protecting us, that's why we dared to confront Delin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, how dare you play tricks on me! Aren't you afraid that I would just eliminate Quinn right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Delin became increasingly frustrated and angry, her hoarse voice sounding very aggressive over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I cannot see him alive with my own eyes, there is no way I will let go of this ten million dollars in cash. I have faithfully fulfilled my part and brought the money here, and as long as I can personally confirm that Quinn is safe, I promise to hand over this ten million dollars in cash to you!" I said firmly over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Fine, since you're so eager to see Quinn, drive another six miles ahead and bring the car to the border!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dehan had told us over the phone that the secret organization, 731 Group, had always been their target for attack. They had been secretly gathering various pieces of evidence of 731 Group's crimes, intending to wait for the right moment to capture all the members of 731 Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the members of the 731 Group were very cunning. They conducted all their domestic operations in a highly regulated manner, while all the dirty and illegal transactions took place in Mexico. This made it extremely difficult to apprehend this group of people, even for the elite border forces. They dared not take any action until the situation became clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Jane and I were not only rescuing Quinn, but also aiming to lure out these criminals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Dehan informed us that they had already set up a tight encirclement in Ruini, as long as Delin is confirmed to also be in Ruini, they can control her and hand her over to the police for handling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, after confirming that Delin was indeed in the white business van, I immediately informed Dehan about the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dehan immediately exclaimed over the phone, "Great! Don't worry, you guys keep driving forward according to the location she mentioned, until they compromise and bring Quinn out! Rest assured, I have secretly arranged many people around you. We will ensure your safety from all angles!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, we knew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving a definite response from Dehan, we felt more at ease. Jane calmly manipulated the steering wheel and immediately drove forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time in my life that I faced such a dangerous situation. As I watched us getting closer and closer to the border, my heart started beating rapidly with nervousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the people from Dehan secretly protecting us, as we got closer and closer to Mexico, I felt a chill down my spine. I kept a close eye on our surroundings and occasionally glanced at the white van closely following us through the rearview mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, we drove the car to the border line. When Jane saw the tall wire fence ahead, she stopped the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Delin immediately called me and eagerly said, "Where is the money? You guys move the cash down first, and then I will have my people bring Quinn out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I packed the ten million dollars in cash into ten separate suitcases. I can bring down five of them first, and once I see Quinn and confirm that he is still alive, I will bring out the remaining five suitcases. Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I became more and more convinced that these people's purpose was just to get money, so my attitude became increasingly firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Madeline, you're talking conditions with me again!" Delin shouted angrily into the phone.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="737.html">« Prev</a><a href="739.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
