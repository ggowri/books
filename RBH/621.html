Then, I pulled Fiona downstairs with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was planning to go back to Paige's ward, but as soon as I reached the door of Paige's ward, I saw Philip standing outside, with strawberries and flowers scattered on the floor at the entrance of the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These things were brought by Philip, but Paige threw them all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip glanced at me wearily and said, "Madeline, help me persuade Paige. She still refuses to talk to me. I brought her favorite strawberries and her beloved flowers, but she threw them all away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should leave. She won't forgive you. Philip, I have warned you, but you didn't pay attention to my words," I said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know I was wrong. In the past, I didn't care enough about her, but I will change in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this to me, Philip suddenly raised his voice and shouted in the direction of the ward, "Paige, believe me. I will never let something like this happen again. This incident made me realize that you are the person I care about!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Philip finished speaking, there was an immediate "bang" sound coming from the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige smashed something in the ward again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you care about her, let her have a few days to calm down and rest. She just lost her child and her emotions are still unstable. Please don't make her feel sad, okay?" I said coldly to Philip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, I quickly pushed open the door of the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I pushed open the door, I saw glass shards all over the floor. Paige had just smashed the glass vase that was placed on the bedside table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, tell him to get lost immediately! I don't want to see him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me, Paige held her head and angrily pounded on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly stepped forward and grabbed her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, don't do this. If you are angry, you should punish him, instead of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hated him, but I hated myself even more. The moment he appeared, I thought of my child. Do you know how much pain I felt when I gave him up? Madeline, I can't close my eyes. Whenever I close my eyes, I feel the pain. I keep wondering if I made the wrong decision. I will never forgive Philip. Philip, go away..." Paige cried out loudly towards the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She became more and more emotional and more painful as she spoke. Her eyes were crying red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm leaving right away. Don't be angry, Paige. I was wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip's voice came from outside the door. Despite his sincere apology, Paige could no longer forgive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held Paige. Seeing her so upset, I couldn't help but cry too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I suddenly received a message on my phone. I picked up the phone and, after seeing the message sent by Giselle, I felt despair...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="620.html">« Prev</a><a href="622.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
