However, I cannot accept this engagement ring and your proposal. I hope you understand, I..." I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was extremely confused in my mind, and I knew that my current behavior resembled that of a greedy and arrogant woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I really had no way to start another marriage and accept another man without any mental preparation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, I knew Quinn was a great guy and his family was kind and nice, but I was scared to face love and marriage again...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know how to face Quinn, so I turned around and faced the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body was trembling lightly. I knew what I was doing. I was saying no to such an </span><span>excellent man who truly loved me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I had no way to force myself to do something I couldn't do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could only act like a heartless woman to make Quinn give it up and let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no sound behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed by minute by minute, each minute and each second, it felt so long, so long that the air seemed to be suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, I heard the sound coming from behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn seemed to stand up and also closed the exquisite jewelry box. I heard a crisp "snap" sound after the box closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought that by rejecting him like this, he would leave and no longer love me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did I expect that he would gently grasp my slightly trembling shoulder, and softly say, "Madeline, are you curious why I am willing to be so kind to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was heavy, as if there was a big story hidden behind him, and now, he finally wanted to speak up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling that subtle signal, I slowly turned around and looked directly into his eyes, nodding. "Well, I actually don't understand. You used to dislike me so much, and it seemed like you looked down on girls who were too proactive like me. But how did you suddenly change your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This has always been a place that has greatly confused me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have asked him more than once in the past, but every time, he would dodge the question and change the topic, unwilling to give a direct answer to my question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, he broke the habit of avoiding my gaze and instead took a deep breath, smiling bitterly. "The reason I didn't answer you before is because some things, when spoken out, may seem too bizarre, so bizarre that you might think they only happen in novels."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's words made me feel a little nervous in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bizarre?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only in novels does it happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does the meaning of his words imply... Did he, like me, also experience rebirth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The answer in my mind was very clear, and I instantly widened my eyes, looking at Quinn in disbelief, "What is so mysterious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn suddenly asked me, "Madeline, have you heard about reincarnation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart suddenly beat strongly, and at the same time, my body trembled even more intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn mentioned rebirth, and suddenly all the answers became apparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that everything is indeed as I suspected, Quinn has actually been reborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would he also be reborn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My eyes widened even more, and I stared at him for a while before asking, "Quinn, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled slightly and finally began to explain everything, "I don't know how to explain this to you because I also find it very strange, but it happened in my life. Madeline, actually you have another life, a life that is completely different from the present. In that life, you didn't wake up in time and were constantly hurt by Elliott and </span><span>Giselle, ending up in a very tragic and miserable situation. In that life of yours, I witnessed everything that happened and also witnessed your death process. Will you find it very puzzling when I say this?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="707.html">« Prev</a><a href="709.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
