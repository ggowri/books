I didn't have much confidence in making other dishes, but I was good at beef spaghetti.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A seemingly simple plate of spaghetti actually involved many techniques, and without any one step, it would never be perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was obviously hungry, and as soon as he sat down, he picked up his fork and began to eat heartily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching him devour the spaghetti with gusto, I didn't need to ask if it was delicious. I already knew it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was also hungry, so I picked up the spaghetti in front of me and started eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We each silently ate our meals. Before long, he quickly finished his spaghetti and then asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is still beef left. I will cook some spaghetti for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, add more beef. This beef is not bad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Delicious food really made people feel better. Elliott's expression visibly relaxed, with a faint smile lingering on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I stewed a lot of beef and thought about freezing them in the refrigerator so that I could take it out and cook it whenever I wanted to eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finished speaking with a smile </span><span>and </span><span>then walked towards the kitchen. Soon, I made another plate of spaghetti for him and served it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was probably really hungry, and soon, the spaghetti was once again devoured by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the meal, he satisfactorily wiped his mouth with a napkin, and for the first time ever, he glanced at me and praised me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did I not know that you could cook spaghetti?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are so many things about me that you don't know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blinked my eyes and also smiled. After all, everyone liked to hear words of praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great. In the future when we are all at home, you can cook more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the future?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he planning to be with me for a long time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was slightly startled, but I didn't think much of it and simply said, "Let's talk about future matters later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not perceive the profound meaning in my words, but just glanced at his watch and then said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's getting late. Let's go to the banquet venue early and see how it goes. Wait for a moment. I'll go change my clothes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Elliott finished speaking, he stood up and went upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a neat freak. He always took a shower and changed his clothes after eating before going out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, not long after, he changed into a brand new haute couture suit and walked down from upstairs, looking handsome and elegant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dress was too expensive, so instead of having the store clerk deliver it to my home, I instructed them to send it directly to the VIP dressing room at the hotel, where I would change into it when the dinner was about to start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, I only wore a casual suit. Anyway, I would have to change into a formal dress later there, so for now, I'd just be as comfortable as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Elliott was probably in a good mood with a full stomach today, and he didn't nitpick at me about anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We went out in the same car, heading to the venue of the Bryant Group's mid-year banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mid-year banquet this time was not only to thank the clients but also to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Bryant Group. Therefore, the Bryant Group started preparing for this event as early as six months ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arriving at the scene, Elliott quickly got busy. He told me to change clothes and get ready, but I saw that it was still early, so I wandered around the venue alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did not attend this event in my previous life, even though I had prepared an evening gown for myself and wanted to accompany Elliott here. However, my face was allergic during those days, and Elliott used this as an excuse to refuse to take me to the dinner party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I actually didn't know how he met Giselle and how they developed feelings for each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, I arrived at the venue early, so that I would have enough time to find Giselle.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="47.html">« Prev</a><a href="49.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
