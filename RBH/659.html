He looked at my rapidly swelling pregnant belly in astonishment, and he was also shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is the child moving so noticeably? It's amazing! With such a small space inside the belly, what is this little one doing every day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He had a lot of things to do. The last time when I was having an ultrasound, he was playing with his fingers. And Fiona said that the baby would also imitate the actions of adults. When I was driving, he would learn to imitate in the belly. I find it very interesting," I said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like the first time that I had such a relaxed conversation with Quinn after going through so many troubles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? That's amazing! The child must be a playful one, as he looks enjoying sports so much. Madeline, maybe we can start preparing for the delivery. I can't wait to see what he looks like when he's born."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was very excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at my belly, overflowing with joy, as if the child inside my belly was his own child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why on earth could Quinn be so selfless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him, feeling a bit ashamed in my heart. But at the same time, there was an increasing sense of being flattered and awkward. After all, we were never really in a romantic relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's caring for me was so overwhelming. I felt like I was a burden to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, now Giselle and Elliott are completely separated from each other, and finally I don't have to worry about it anymore. I have prepared myself to be a single mother. And you, you're still young, so go find a woman who truly loves you. You will have your own baby." I lifted my head and said to Quinn with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this topic, Quinn's originally bright smile froze on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why are you bringing up this topic again? We have agreed on this. I will always be there for you! Giselle and Elliott have no chance of being together anymore, so he may turn to pester you. That's my worry. Haven't you noticed that Elliott has been paying more and more attention to you? If you push me away now, how can you deal with him alone? Do you expect to get back together with him after the child is born? If that's the case, I respect your decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was clearly angry when I mentioned this topic, especially in the last sentence, where his disappointment towards me was extremely evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I didn't think that way. I just felt that you have done so much for me, which makes me feel guilty. You shouldn't sacrifice your life for me. After all, I can't give you anything," I hurriedly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came back to life just for you! I don't need anything from you. I have always said that I don't expect anything in return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn became suddenly excited. However, I was shocked when he suddenly said, "I </span><span>am alive again because of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, what did you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at his eyes intently, while countless associations accompanied his words just now, constantly unfolding in my mind.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="658.html">« Prev</a><a href="660.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
