I've said you don't have to be. Go home and explain it to your parents. Don't upset your family because of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Quinn, I felt even more guilty and anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. My parents just feel it's too sudden. After all, they didn't hear me mention having a girlfriend before. This sudden arrival of a grandchild must annoy them. Don't worry. I can handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn still hadn't changed his attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better think about it, Quinn. My decision stands. I'll walk my own path, and I don't need you to sacrifice for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I emphasized it again and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, hearing my words, Quinn pulled my hair furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. Don't say this again. It will displease the baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that said, Quinn gently patted my belly. I was calm, but his serious look made my heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a conversation was supposed to happen between a father and a pregnant mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never dared to expect it before because, upon learning that I was pregnant, I chose to be a single mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Quinn's actions had truly illuminated for me the profound joy experienced by both men and women when they became parents for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn had already started packing his bags. Even though the doctor said he needed to be hospitalized for two more days, his parents had ordered him to return, so we had to check out of the hospital early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, People's Hospital of Carthage was no longer in a tight spot. Oliver, out of gratitude, signed an order with us to keep supplying them with anti-flu capsules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before our departure, I went to say goodbye to Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After these days together, we had all built up a special bond with this hospital. When we were about to leave, Oliver even brought many medical staff to the door to see us drive away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was injured, so I asked Adam to drive for him and let him rest in the backseat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After we went back to Hoswich smoothly, Adam and I dropped Quinn off at his parents' house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time I knew that the place where Quinn's parents lived turned out to be Riverina, the oldest villa area in Hoswich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riverina was located in the center of the city. The villas, ancient yet very well preserved, were beyond the reach of ordinary folk, their worth immeasurable by mere currency. Acquiring a villa here required more than wealth. People who lived here were usually the oldest families in Hoswich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These families boasted histories spanning at least a century, often including a prominent figure who had made substantial contributions to the country. This legacy afforded them the privilege to reside here for generations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's parents lived in a villa in the core area. Adorned with flowers and vines, the exterior exuded elegance, and the enclosed courtyard appeared particularly refined. Despite its age, both the outer wall and inner yard were meticulously maintained, giving it a timeless and stylish appearance.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="533.html">« Prev</a><a href="535.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
