You must've seen all the rumors about the lead actress online these past few days, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rickson's expression suddenly took on a meaningful depth. He clearly grasped my intent and responded with a calm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I've seen them. But which actress doesn't have some scandals before they make it big? It's not really a big issue. Adam has been in touch with me several times. Of course, I know that Glory Group is worried that Bryant Group's show might outperform 'Do Not Love'. But really, you shouldn't worry. Your show's ratings are already much higher than expected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was apparent he was trying to brush me off, so I cut straight to the chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said, "Rickson, it's not 'Allure' I'm worried about affecting 'Do Not Love'. I'm concerned someone might be targeting you, stirring up trouble behind the scenes to pressure you. Frankly, I've recently received some photos and videos that I think you should see to understand what I mean."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pulled out my phone and showed him the images and video Ken had taken of Rickson and Jezebel spending time together at the hot springs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Rickson was composed. However, a glance at the photos made his face turn pale, and he jumped up from his chair in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trembling, he pointed at me and stammered, "Where did you get these photos? Ms. Mayers, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear he understood the ramifications if these photos got out, which was why he panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly put away my phone and stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I reassured him, "Rickson, I've bought all these photos and videos for a high price. I assure you, no one else has them. After today, I'll destroy them all as a token of my acquaintance with you. However, I must warn you about Jezebel. She's no simple woman. I'm worried that after your network has made her a star, she might use these photos to blackmail you into doing her bidding. That could get messy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately smeared Jezebel. Rickson, of course, caught on instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes darted as he asked, "Are you suggesting Jezebel had someone take these?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hall, you're a veteran in the entertainment industry. You undoubtedly know these tricks of new stars better than I do. Who else could have timed it so perfectly and chosen such angles if not her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a knowing smile, and then, in front of Rickson, I deleted the photos and videos from my phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my actions, he understood my sincerity. Intelligent people didn't need to say much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression relaxed. "Madeline, I didn't expect such a special gift the first time we met. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That incident had him sweating bullets, and he quickly lost any thought of taking advantage. He raised his glass to me in a toast, and soon after, we parted ways.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="428.html">« Prev</a><a href="430.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
