He doesn't seem like the type to be so foolish. How could he just run off on his own?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I murmured, asking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything Barry said was completely unlike the Elliott I knew.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my mind, Elliott was never this kind of person. He was always rational. How could he be so reckless? Knowing the danger, he still rushed here, throwing caution to the wind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For... me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Am I really that important to him?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My limbs were still numb, and as I looked at Barry, I felt a bit dazed, as if he was spinning a tale.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there he was, Barry, sitting right in front of me. Always serious, cautious, and well-behaved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for something stirring Barry's soul, there's no way he'd come running to me with all this, not with his personality.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Mr. Bryant insisted on going alone, I tried to stop him. But he said, 'Time is life. If I get there a second earlier, I can save you a second earlier.' He was afraid that if he was even a little bit late, you'd be taken to Mexico, and then it would be too late."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry looked at me, sincerity shining in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was dumbstruck.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively reminisced about the situation back then.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were indeed close to Mexico at the time. It was truly when Elliott suddenly roared up on his dirt bike that they halted to deal with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it not been for Elliott getting there first and stalling them, by the time Dehan and his crew arrived, I would have likely been whisked away across the border.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, it hit me even harder. The person who played a pivotal role in my rescue was none other than Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart felt as if it had been brutally struck by something, the towering wall within me seemed to suddenly crumble... I looked at Barry, a wave of sadness involuntarily washing over me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How's he doing now? Is he still staring death in the face?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found myself asking, my eyes welling up with unexplained tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's still in the ICU, hanging on for now, but... he hasn't woken up yet. That's why I came to find you, Mrs. Bryant. Once you're feeling a bit better, could you visit Mr. Bryant? I feel like he's been waiting for you. No matter how much I assure him that you're okay, it doesn't seem to help. I think he needs to hear your voice to truly believe that you're alright."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry spoke to me rapidly, his eyes growing increasingly red.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In all the years I've known Barry, this is the first time I've ever seen him shed a tear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fell into silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, I had long since written Elliott out of my life, treating him as the most familiar stranger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I never imagined, not even in my wildest dreams, that Elliott would go to such lengths for me. He was willing to risk it all, even his own life, just to ensure my survival.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could relate to all his feelings at that moment, because when I heard about Quinn's mishap, I had the exact same thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't have time to ponder, nor did I consider the risks of venturing into such a dangerous place while pregnant. There was only one thought in my mind - I hoped Quinn was alive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I'm doing this, not because I love Quinn, but because I feel like I owe him too much. If he really dies, I'll never be able to forgive myself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Elliott come to my rescue out of love, or was it because he felt he owed me something?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="757.html">« Prev</a><a href="759.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
