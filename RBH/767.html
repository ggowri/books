She's itching to get back to Norch City for a do-over as soon as she's healed. We'll handle that, you just focus on getting better and taking care of Noah. Leave the work stuff to others."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A week later, Jane was discharged from the hospital, her wounds healed. The very next day, she booked a flight and, together with Marcus, they headed to Norch City to investigate the situation on the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing them off, as per usual, I made my way to Bryant Hospital to visit Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, many of the tubes attached to Elliott had been removed. His superficial wounds had also been stitched up. He lay there, looking no different from an ordinary patient, except for his slightly pale and sickly complexion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry confided in me, insisting that my daily visits and chats with him throughout the week were doing wonders. Elliott's neurological responses were growing stronger by the day. The doctors assured us that he was out of the woods, no longer in a life-threatening situation. Once the tubes were removed, he could wake up at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this news, I too, felt a sense of comfort.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting across from him, I took his hand just like before. I gently pressed my fingertips into his palm, letting him feel my presence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterwards, I propped my chin in my hand, quietly studying his sleeping face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cheeks appeared more gaunt than before, his already sharp chin seemed even sharper. His nose remained as perky as ever. His lips held a faint hint of color. His skin, under the refracted light from the window, was exceptionally pale, his long eyelashes fanning over his eyelids. Without the tubes, Elliott no longer looked like a patient, but rather a sleeping prince, an aura of nobility subtly radiating from his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been here every day this week. Every day, I've been whispering non-stop into his ear. I've spoken volumes, about the past, about my feelings since we've been apart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was asleep, and I found this kind of confession to be completely stress-free for me. On the contrary, it allowed me to vent out all those words from the bottom of my heart that I wouldn't dare to mention on a regular day. This was quite good for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've said all there is to say. Today, I went out of my way to fill a basin with water, planning to wash his face and hands, and even give his body a good scrub.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In all the years I've known him, I've never done this. But now he's a patient, so I do these things with ease.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, I gently wiped his face. Then, button by button, I undid his shirt, starting to cleanse his body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to a period of inactivity, his abs were not as pronounced as before, only faint traces of their former chiseled glory could be seen. His skin, once radiant, now bore subtle wrinkles.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My gaze was steady, gently wiping across his skin inch by inch. My movements were soft, my eyes pure. In that moment, my mind was void of any thoughts. I simply hoped that through this act, I could bring some comfort and relaxation to him, who had been lying there for so long.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After cleaning his upper body, I unfastened his trousers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard that lying down for too long can lead to bedsores. So, after wiping his front, I mustered up the strength to lift his body, intending to clean his back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is nothing more than the standard procedure for taking care of a patient.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as I was wiping his back, preparing to lay him flat, I suddenly noticed a certain part of his body rapidly swelling within my line of sight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bent over as I was, this sudden shift unfolded right before my eyes. It was so abrupt, crashing into my line of sight, nearly grazing my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I realized what it was, my heart started pounding like a drum. I couldn't help but jerk back swiftly, nearly toppling over in a clumsy tumble due to my unstable balance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, I didn't fall.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when I thought I was going down, a hand, steady and strong, suddenly caught me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could even react, I felt an immense force yanking me fiercely. The next thing I knew, I was tumbling onto his firm, warm chest.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="766.html">« Prev</a><a href="768.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
