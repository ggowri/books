Is he out of his mind? Why on earth is he drinking in the middle of the night?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hit my ears, a mix of urgency and irritation. I couldn't help but yell into the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's oblivious to the fact that his body hasn't fully recovered yet. I tried to stop him, but he just snapped at me. Mrs. Bryant, I'm afraid I'll need your help to talk some sense into him. If he continues drinking like this, I'm genuinely worried about his health."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry spoke into the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you guys at? I'll come over."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sigh of resignation, I rose from my bed and addressed the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry shot me their location in no time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze at the sight. I hadn't expected to find Elliott at Quinn's club.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was their base before their fallout. It was only natural for him to go there, guided by his past memories.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fearful of catching a chill, I bundled myself up in a thick scarf, donned a duckbill cap, and hit the road. Before long, I arrived at my destination.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stepping out of the elevator, I was taken aback to find Quinn waiting for me at the entrance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was late, the club had already closed, eerily empty. Quinn, clad in a crisp white shirt with a dark grey suit jacket lazily slung over his shoulder, approached me immediately upon sight. He flicked his head towards the interior, indicating the direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry mentioned that Elliott has amnesia. He's stuck in a time before your divorce, is that true?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, "Yes."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn fixed his gaze on me, his eyes instantly brimming with tension:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what's your plan? You gonna play along with his charade?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understood why he was on edge. But right now, I was out of options, all I could do was give a wry smile and nod.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Jones mentioned there's a clot in his brain, we can't risk agitating his nerves. For now, I can only play along, taking it one step at a time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my words, Quinn steadied me by the shoulders. He deliberately lowered his voice:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But wouldn't this just entangle you with him again, Madeline? You've fought so hard to break free from him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, but he got hurt so badly because he was saving me, Quinn. I can't just stand by and let him die."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my gaze, offering an apologetic look to Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I know, he's still waiting for my response. But with Elliott's current situation, I really can't make any decisions right now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There must be another way to save him, Madeline. I don't want you to do this. I fear that once you get close to him, you'll slowly fall for him again. Deep down, you haven't completely let go of him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn attempted to console me. At his words, I jerked my head up, shaking it vehemently in denial:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Quinn, I haven't loved him for a long time now. What I'm doing now, it's just out of conscience. I won't get caught up in it, you can rest easy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying all that, I gave Quinn a reassuring pat on the shoulder. Then, I sidestepped him and walked into the room where Elliott was.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="782.html">« Prev</a><a href="784.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
