Quinn is still so young, how can he be out of time?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole glanced at me, on the verge of speaking, yet as if considering something, she remained silent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had a hunch she wanted to tell me something. I was about to press further when her mother emerged from the nursery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah is just too adorable, I'm already finding myself missing the little guy. Lily, jot down my number, I'll come over and help you take care of Noah whenever I can."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing, we can take him out for a spin together. Just give me a ring whenever you're free."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright, we'll be off for today then. We'll come visit Noah another day."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two exchanged phone numbers, then bid each other farewell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, we watched them leave our home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood at the door, watching the scene of my mom and Carole's mom parting reluctantly, like sisters. It reminded me of past times when my mom was often the target of Laura's sarcasm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon such comparison, I couldn't help but let out a soft sigh, my heart filled with a myriad of emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was standing at the door for a moment, about to step in, when my phone buzzed with a call from Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you free tomorrow noon?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there something up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked, utterly clueless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow's the weekend," my mom said. "It's been a while since we've had a meal together. I'd love to cook for us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't Laura just leave my place?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now you're cooking for me again?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Will she poison me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly chimed in:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you should head home and eat. I might have to work overtime at the office tomorrow, so I may not have the time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it's been a while since we've had dinner at Bryant Villa. My mom mentioned she'd love for us to come over. Could you possibly reschedule your overtime?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pleaded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I genuinely don't have the time..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was still inclined to refuse, but before I could even finish my sentence, Elliott suddenly interjected softly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you forget? Tomorrow's my birthday&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Elliott's words, a slight pause took hold of my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively glanced at the date on my phone. Indeed, tomorrow would mark his 30th birthday.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I would remember his birthday every year. Even before the day arrived, I would start preparing meticulously in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That date, it's as if it's etched into my muscle memory.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, if he doesn't mention it, I've completely forgotten that string of numbers, let alone remember when his birthday actually is.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Elliott uttered the words "Don't you remember?", there was a palpable sense of loss in his voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found myself at a loss for words. After a moment, I finally managed to speak:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, let me wish you a happy birthday in advance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rather than hearing you say 'Happy Birthday', I'd much prefer to go home with you, spend some time with our parents, and have a family dinner. Madeline, that's my birthday wish. Can you make it come true?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott spoke with a tone of humility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, pick me up at noon tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, I just couldn't bear to refuse, so I reluctantly agreed to his request.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 11 AM the next day, he showed up right on time at the base of my office building.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I descended the stairs, I was clad in casual sportswear, ready for the afternoon tennis match I had planned with Paige and Fiona.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, every time I saw Elliott's family, I would always dress to the nines. Now, I couldn't care less about their opinions, so it doesn't matter what I wear.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="859.html">« Prev</a><a href="861.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
