If you don't believe me, you can go check at the hospital yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle looked at me triumphantly, her demeanor now openly hostile towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body continued to tremble uncontrollably while she had already finished a whole cup of cappuccino, looking more content than I ever did when drinking alcohol.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Cormac received the results, he was furious and immediately called Elliott, demanding he divorce you as soon as possible. Madeline, your joy won't last long. So, find a way out for yourself quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying these words, Giselle called the waiter to pay the bill, and then she left gracefully.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I slumped in my chair, staring at the report, feeling a wave of despair wash over me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Severe endometriosis has rendered me congenitally infertile? What does this even mean?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have never been intimated with anyone, so how could I have this illness?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is all of this really not just one of Giselle's cruel pranks?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found it hard to believe, so I logged into the hospital's website, entered my name, and retrieved the report. To my shock, the report on the screen was identical to the one Giselle had given me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, I stood there in a daze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up the report and walked out of the caf&eacute; in a trance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sunlight outside was blinding, and not far away, a young couple pushed a white baby stroller past me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gazed at the adorable child in the stroller, feeling a sudden pang in my heart, tears streaming down uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Am I never going to have my own child in this lifetime?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What exactly is congenital endometriosis?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never heard of such an illness before and never imagined that someone like me, who had never slept with anyone, would be associated with such a disease.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in my thoughts, I sat down on a nearby stone bench, searching on my phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The professional terms and infertility cases on the webpage left me stunned and frightened. Just then, an unknown number called.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I answered in a daze, weakly saying hello.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man's voice came through the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this Mrs. Bryant? I am Doctor Louis. I regret to inform you that the test results show you have severe congenital endometriosis, and furthermore, I have found signs of early ovarian failure. All results indicate a very low chance of pregnancy for you. If you seek timely treatment, there might still be a glimmer of hope. I recommend you come to the hospital for a follow-up soon."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately realized that this was the authoritative expert that Cormac had recommended.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Already feeling devastated, I was not prepared for him to call and deliver this news.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those professional terms weighing in my heart, my mind was thrown into chaos. Without waiting for him to finish, I hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after hanging up, my phone rang again. This time, it was Quinn calling.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="254.html">« Prev</a><a href="256.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
