He was talkative, with a sharp and honest gleam in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where can you find a businessman like you, who doesn't prioritize making money? Marcus, I really admire you sometimes, being able to do this," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong determination in him moved my heart, and I couldn't help but admire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, come on! Stop that! I'm just doing something that I'm able to do. You know, the infusion rooms in every hospital are overcrowded every year during flu season. Everyone knows that antibiotics are not good, but there's no better alternative with fewer side effects, so antibiotics are still widely used time and time again. I just want to do my best, regardless of the cost. If I can make everyone use such medicine, then I can consider it a good deed," Marcus once again spoke about his original intention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, you have that determination in you, whatever you do, you can do it successfully. You focus on research and development, and if there is not enough funding, I can always support it. Anyway, our Glory Group's funds are currently more than sufficient," I said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to that TV drama opening up the film and television market, the investment in this anti-flu capsule has also generated a lot of benefits. In addition, Glory Group's mechanical products have been consistently profitable for many years. The part that Jade emptied before has been promptly filled by me. Now, Glory Group is much better than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I really should thank you, no one else believed in me as much as you did, truly." Marcus looked at me, his eyes filled with sincere gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You always take good care of my family and me. It should be us who should say thank you. Let's go, it's dinner time. I'll treat you to dinner and welcome you!" I stood up, glanced at the time, and shook my head at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Our current relationship has become so familiar that we no longer need to be polite to each other. When I said this, Marcus readily agreed and said that he was indeed hungry, as he had not eaten since he came back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I left Glory Group with him and drove to a newly opened French restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus really liked French cuisine, and that restaurant mainly served authentic French dishes. The decoration and atmosphere were also very elegant. When we arrived, there weren't many people in the restaurant, so we chose a table by the window and sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, what do you love to eat? Order for yourself, don't try to save money for me." As soon as we sat down, I pushed the menu toward him and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let me have a look. It's been a long time since I had French cuisine, and I really miss it." Marcus took the menu and started browsing it attentively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rested my chin on my hand and looked around aimlessly at the surroundings. Just as I was about to withdraw my gaze, unexpectedly, I caught sight of a familiar black figure, who suddenly walked into the store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That person was Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect the world to be so small. In the blink of an eye, we actually met again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had Barry by his side, and he didn't look like he was here to meet someone. After entering the store, he whispered a few words to Barry, and then he instinctively looked up and glanced at the surroundings inside the store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with just one glance, he instantly locked his gaze on me, and a glimmer of surprise flashed in his eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="694.html">« Prev</a><a href="696.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
