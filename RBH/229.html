He pushed away Quinn's hand with all his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not your concern whether I can do it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was pushed so hard by him. Besides, he was drunk. So, he lost his balance and almost fell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He managed to stand firm and turned to look at Elliott. They glared at each other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn yelled, "I don't care about your affairs with any woman, but I will never allow you to hurt Madeline from now on! If you can't make her happy, stay away from her!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know why Quinn protected me so desperately, even at the cost of turning against Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his words, Elliott was instantly furious. He sneered and looked at Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't make her happy. Can you? Quinn, I never thought that you would covet my woman!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I covet your woman?" Quinn couldn't help laughing as if he had heard the funniest joke in the world. Suddenly, he rushed over and punched Elliott in the face, saying, "Elliott, can you wake up? I just want you to be a good person!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay away from my affairs!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was also infuriated again. There seemed to be irresolvable hatred between them. The two mature men started fighting like teenagers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was completely stunned. When I reacted, I hurriedly stepped forward to stop them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? Can you stop being so childish?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to separate them, but they had lost their minds. Elliott grabbed Quinn's head and punched it hard. Quinn kicked Elliott in his chest violently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my impression, Elliott had learned boxing since childhood. Quinn also came from a powerful family. So, he must have learned as many skills as Elliot did.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They scuffled, and I was too weak to separate them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fought hard for a while as if determined to compete. Finally, the corner of Elliott's mouth bled, and Quinn's right eye was bruised. They looked embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were adults and knew how to stop themselves from getting too far. And they didn't intend to kill each other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their friendship for so many years was ruined after the fight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott warned, "Stay away from Madeline from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, unless you can make her happy. Otherwise, I will always be by her side," Quinn said firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are looking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was pissed off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn snorted and said, "If you weren't so terrible, I wouldn't have done this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott almost wanted to punch him again, but in the end, he restrained himself. He suddenly held me in his arms and held my hand tightly as if afraid that I would be taken by Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go home," said Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew Elliot must have wished I could take his side and go back with him at this moment,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when I thought about what he had done to Giselle and thought that we could never be happy together, I couldn't calm down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook off his hand, took two steps back, and said calmly, "I've told my parents I would go home today, and I don't want to go back to Serenity Villa. Sorry!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me with extremely disbelieving eyes. He couldn't help shouting my name. He was in astonishment and seemed unable to believe I would reject him.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="228.html">« Prev</a><a href="230.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
