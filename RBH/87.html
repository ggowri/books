However, he didn't ask further and truthfully said, "Rowan is capable. When we were in college, he was the student council president. Otherwise, Giselle wouldn't like him either. Madeline, why are you asking me these questions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan had the ability... very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan was a great stumbling block. If I easily let him return to his hometown, the relationship between Giselle and Elliott would have developed even more rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled slightly and patted Adam's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think love during college was the most beautiful. It would be such a pity if they were to separate like this. Tell Rowan not to go home, I can help him find a suitable job."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam didn't expect that I would be so enthusiastic, his eyes were shining brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Madeline, you are an angel. Rowan's profession is law. He just graduated, but many places do not accept interns. Moreover, he was too focused on dating during college, which resulted in average grades, so no law firm was willing to hire him. He had to work in real estate sales, but it doesn't suit him and he is not doing well. If you can help him, he will definitely be grateful to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was very concerned about Rowan. After listening to me, he immediately told me about Rowan's situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will ask a friend for help first. Tell him to stay in Hoswich for now," I whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning to the office, I sat on the chair and thought for a while. Then, I called Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn answered the phone quickly. He seemed very happy when he received my call. I could hear him laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, why did you suddenly call me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Woods, do you have any friends who are lawyers? I want to help my family find a job. He just graduated from college, majoring in law."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I will get straight to the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Alexis founded a law firm. Send me your family's resumes, and I will forward them to Alexis," Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis seemed to be a good friend of Elliott. I forgot that he was a renowned lawyer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, thank you for your help. Please arrange a good position," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, I forwarded the resume of Rowan that Adam sent me to Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn received the resume. He remained silent for more than ten seconds on the phone and suddenly asked me, "Rowan Fisher? Are you sure he is your relative?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he was a distant relative," I replied vaguely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I got it," Quinn deliberately dragged out his tone, as if realizing something. However, he didn't ask any further. "Alright, wait for my good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, I suddenly remembered the matter of the Bryant Group purchasing flowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I recommended Paige to the Purchasing Department manager of the Bryant Group, but Paige has never mentioned this to me. I don't know how this matter has progressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, after work, I made plans to meet Paige and Fiona at our usual restaurant for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant was located by the seaside in Hoswich and had a romantic name, called Listen to the Wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We hadn't seen each other for a long time. As soon as we saw each other, we hugged each other.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="86.html">« Prev</a><a href="88.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
