Even though I could stop loving Elliott, I would never be willing to let them be together so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't divorcing Elliott now giving her the greatest convenience to rise to power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, I didn't want to be that foolish. If anything, I wanted to divorce, at least after I had messed up their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, I wouldn't tell anyone about such a sinister idea. After all, no one knows how much pain I went through in my previous life except for myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you handle it yourself then, in short, all I want is for you to be happy, Fiona said the same. You are fully focused on your career now, and we all fully support you!" Paige knew I had my difficulties, so she said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I know, thank you." I nodded, feeling even more warm in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thanking for? Just arrange a few handsome guys for me to have a crazy time with tonight. Talking about those unreal things is useless." Paige's infatuated nature was once again exposed, and she had already started looking forward to the party tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, no problem!" I smiled and winked, then I made a phone call and gave Adam some instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As clever as Adam was, I didn't need to say much for him to understand what I meant. He reassured me that he would take care of everything for the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After drinking coffee with Paige, we returned to the hotel from the set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I searched through the clothes that I carried with me and found a sexy black sequin slip dress, while Paige had come prepared long ago, she brought an extremely sexy hollowed-out top and a pair of ripped jeans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After changing our clothes and having a simple meal, we directly set off to a bar near the film and television city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam had already booked the venue in advance and gathered several lead actors and young male actors from the crew to have a small gathering there and celebrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nightclubs have always been Paige's domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she arrived there, she unconsciously became very excited. With Adam's cooperation, the atmosphere at the scene was quickly ignited by the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the day, they originally felt a certain distance from me, but at night, the dim lights brought people closer together, and everyone became more uninhibited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know who started the commotion, but someone encouraged me to go up and dance with everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never tried dancing on stage before, but under everyone's encouragement, I was pushed onto the stage directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, the DJ played the most exciting music, and several young male actors surrounded me, starting to showcase their dancing skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige constantly encouraged me to start dancing with her seductive moves. Under their repeated urging and the influence of alcohol, I made up my mind and decided to completely let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Live freely, live for yourself, and never be bound by anyone again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do whatever you want, be yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like someone whispering in my ear, the long-lost youthful energy ignited another me within my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I started dancing along with the music, and with their encouragement, I got more and more into it. Finally, Paige and I ended up dancing intimately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone at the scene cheered, and this kind of happiness was something I had never experienced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind and soul were completely empty, and all the thoughts in my mind turned blank. I just recklessly twisted my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as I was dancing wildly to the most intense part, suddenly, a piercing sound came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately after, the entire bar was suddenly plunged into darkness, and even the DJ's music came to an abrupt halt, enveloping everything in an inexplicable silence...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="147.html">« Prev</a><a href="149.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
