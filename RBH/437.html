So, when we entered, Alexis and Fiona were in each other's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They probably never expected someone to walk in at that moment. They quickly disentangled themselves, their faces a mix of panic and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until they saw it was Quinn and me that they somewhat regained their composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you guys doing here? Why come so late?" Fiona asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona wore a lab coat, I noticed her voice was hoarse, and her eyes were red as if she had just been crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline's not feeling well. She keeps throwing up lately and wants you to check on her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn watched Alexis and Fiona with a smirk as if he knew something but chose not to expose it, simply stating coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now? That's incredibly rude. If you need to see a doctor, you should make an appointment first. How could you just barge into the doctor's office..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this point, Alexis had regained his composure. He glared at Quinn and couldn't help but retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we hadn't barged in, how would we have witnessed that spectacle? It's late. Why aren't you resting instead of sneaking into the doctor's office?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, fully aware of the embarrassing situation, deliberately pointed it out, causing Fiona to blush instantly, while Alexis turned awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mind your own business..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis lowered his head, at a loss for words, and muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona walked over and pulled me aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your face is so pale. Why do I smell alcohol on you? Did you drink tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had a little drink. I don't know why, but I just can't handle alcohol these days. I throw up as soon as I drink," I confessed honestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's been throwing up a lot lately. Fiona, could you check on her? She's not pregnant, is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn chimed in, his comment turning Fiona's face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way? She couldn't possibly be..." Fiona's initial reaction was just like mine. However, she suddenly asked me, "Have you been taking the medication Dr. Cullen prescribed you on time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded. "Yes, I've been following the prescription strictly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona then had a thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That could be possible. Dr. Cullen is really skilled in this area. Madeline, most doctors are off now, so you should go get a blood test first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Fiona arranged for a blood test for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skeptically, I went for the blood test, and afterward, I waited quietly in Fiona's office for the results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, I had no hopes regarding being pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Fiona's words inexplicably made my heart race.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="436.html">« Prev</a><a href="438.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
