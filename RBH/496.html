I never expected that they would arrange my seat and Elliott's side by side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that most people hadn't arrived yet, I wanted to talk to the staff and ask them to change my seat to another place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, when I stood up and wanted to walk out, I saw a man wearing a black suit and a black mask walking in my direction. It was Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After not seeing him for more than half a month, he looked much thinner than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suit he was wearing was the one I bought for him in the past. However, probably because he had lost a lot of weight, the suit did not fit so well and looked a little too big. The trouser legs of the suit looked empty and dangling frivolously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't see his expression clearly because he wore a mask. I raised my head and accidentally met his cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed me as well and suddenly stopped. In between about seven or eight chairs apart, we exchanged gazes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time we met after our divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't see through his deep eyes to guess the expression on his face at that moment. I just felt that the seven or eight chairs between us were like a chasm, separating us into two different spacetimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind went blank. Before coming to the event, I thought that I might inevitably meet Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I never imagined that we would meet in such an embarrassing way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grand ceremony was about to begin, and countless guests were flocking into the venue. At that moment, a man's voice came from behind me. "Ma'am, please give way. My seat is in front of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned sideways hastily. Then, I saw a man wearing a suit, about 5.6 feet tall, who looked gentlemanly. He politely walked past me and sat in the seat in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did I come back to my senses and immediately withdrew my gaze. In order to avoid the embarrassment of meeting Elliott, I immediately turned around and walked to the other side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I went directly to the staff at the venue and tactfully expressed my request. "Hello, can I change my position? It's not very convenient for me to get in and out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Ms. Mayers. I'm sorry, all the seats at our venue have been arranged in advance, and we have also notified the guests. If we suddenly make changes, I'm afraid it will cause bad associations with other guests. Besides, we specially arranged the best seat in the second row for you. Are you dissatisfied with the current seat?" the staff member said to me respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the guests had already taken their seats, and Elliott had also calmly sat in the seat arranged for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked over and immediately understood that the organizer had actually carefully arranged each seat. I remembered that in the film and television industry, both seating and standing were connected to many things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff was in a dilemma, so naturally, I didn't want to make it difficult for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the hem of my skirt, I walked helplessly through the crowd and returned to my seat again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat quietly next to me without saying a word. The moment I sat down, he still didn't move at all and didn't even spare me a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a cold breath swept toward my face. Elliott was as indifferent as the day when he first met me, which made me shudder uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he really didn't love me anymore. I didn't expect him to let go so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I could understand it. After all, I was able to let go of my feelings for Elliott after loving him for so many years. It only took a short time for him to fall for me, so a man like him could easily let go of his feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously folded my hands around myself and stared straight ahead like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, a burst of magnificent music sounded in the hall. After the music, the host began to make the announcement, indicating that the ceremony was about to start.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="495.html">« Prev</a><a href="497.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
