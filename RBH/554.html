The expression on her face was very complicated. She muttered, "Doctor Louis said that there is almost no possibility of you getting pregnant. How come you are pregnant all of a sudden?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to ask if the doctor you found is reliable. But..." Paige felt even happier for me when she saw Laura's appearance and sneered coldly, "If I were you, I would be ashamed that I had driven Madeline out of the house just because of a word of a doctor and let a woman from nowhere replace Madeline. I don't know what the others will think of the Bryant family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had always been straightforward. Her words made Laura look embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Laura might have gained hope when she heard that I was pregnant, so she did not lose her temper but kept smiling at me and said, "Madeline, you have to take good care of yourself since you are pregnant now. Don't be too tired. Don't be like Giselle who makes me worried. Don't worry. Whoever gives birth to the eldest grandson of the Bryant family will be the mistress of the Bryant family. I promise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until this moment, Laura was still daydreaming, mistakenly believing that I wanted to use my baby to return to the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sneered, "Laura, you think too much. The baby in my belly has nothing to do with Elliott. Please, just stop thinking about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura covered her mouth in shock, looked at me suspiciously, and then immediately shook her head, saying, "You must be lying to me. It's only three months after you divorced Elliott. Your baby must be Elliott's. Madeline, I know you hate me because of Giselle, but I couldn't do anything about it. Cormac forced me to do this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's attitude towards me suddenly changed, and she even put all the blame on Cormac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she forget how she looked like when she forced me to divorce?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Laura Bryant, please stop acting, okay? Do you think you can compensate Madeline by pleasing her when she is pregnant? No way!" Paige yelled at Laura as she heard Laura's words. Paige then dragged me, knocked Laura away, and walked towards the B-ultrasonic room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura wanted to catch up again, but this time, the nurse outside the B-ultrasonic room stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked with Paige for a short distance, and we suddenly stopped and looked at each other, and then we laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at her. I feel like she is regretting it to death. It's exciting!" Paige held her chest and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, but it's too late for her to regret it now. No matter what, I will never let the child in my belly have anything to do with the Bryant family," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously stroked my belly and swore in my heart again.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="553.html">« Prev</a><a href="555.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
