The potential of this show was beyond my imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I vaguely remember that in my last life, the huge success of this show made Sylvia become a famous star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in this life, Audrey's acting skills and appearance were better than Sylvia's. With this drama, Audrey's development would be better than Sylvia's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Audrey, now signed with Glory Group, had become our first popular artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought that I could enter the film and television industry with this TV series and make more money in the next two years to quickly fill the cash gap of Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On my way back with Adam from the hospital, I kept thinking about it and gradually came up with an idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The awards ceremony of the Oscars would be held at the beginning of next year. After all, it was almost the end of the year, and Christmas was coming soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, we received an invitation to the annual banquet for the entrepreneurs in Hoswich. Mr. Austin Mayers was still recuperating at home, so are you going to attend this annual banquet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was driving and suddenly asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The annual banquet for the entrepreneurs in Hoswich?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my impression, this was a rare chance for all entrepreneurs in Hoswich to communicate. Austin used to attend it every year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I got married, Austin took me there a few times. He wanted to broaden my horizons, but unfortunately, I was a lovesick girl at that time, so I went there just to see Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that I wanted to develop the Glory Group, of course, I had to seize this opportunity so that I could know more people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. When will this annual banquet start?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It will be held at six o'clock tomorrow night in the Treasure Hall on the second floor of Hoswich International Hotel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam said immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I got it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To attend this event, I went specifically to the most prestigious high-end fashion store in Hoswich and chose a sapphire blue strapless evening dress for myself. The dress was tailored very sophisticatedly, which perfectly flattered my figure, and the color made my skin extremely fair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also needed a set of high-end jewelry to match this dress. I especially chose the Cartier Incantation necklace and Panth&egrave;re De Cartier sapphiring that my dad gave me back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although being pregnant, my lower abdomen remained flat, and since I am tall, I didn&rsquo;t think anyone could tell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ensure my safety, I didn't wear high heels but a pair of white flats decorated with diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 5:30 pm the next day, I arrived at the venue on time with the invitation letter in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I had the invitation letter, the security staff immediately welcomed me into Treasure Hall attentively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as I stepped into the venue, I heard a burst of discussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked over and saw several ladies in gorgeous clothes chatting happily not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at them and saw Giselle wearing a champagne-colored ruffled gown. She had tied her hair high. She stood among a group of ladies and smiled shyly, with her hands on her belly.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="450.html">« Prev</a><a href="452.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
