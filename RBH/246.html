Eat more shrimp. Fiona mentioned that it's great for men's health."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly loaded his plate with plenty of shrimp.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott caught the underlying meaning in my words and, across the table, playfully flicked my nose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're naughty, Madeline," he remarked, calling my name in an affectionate manner that made me cringe a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit embarrassed, I glanced at him, but his joyful smile softened my unease.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His genuine joy was palpable, a stark contrast to his previous resistance to my advances and his insistence that we could never conceive a child together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, now Elliott's attitude had changed drastically, and he actually looked forward to having a child with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Could it be that I have misjudged his feelings for Giselle?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, as he claimed, she is just a relative to him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that eating seaweed raw is beneficial for you. Oh, and oysters are said to be a useful supplement too. Shall I call the waiter to order them?" I teased, blinking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally composed, Elliott surprisingly burst into laughter at my playful banter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, but these foods are not easy to digest. I'd only eat them if you stay the night with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to grasp my subtle hint, looking at me with a suggestive gaze and a touch of romance in his words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, I shook my head hastily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I can't. I've already delayed for a few days. If I don't head to Louis City soon, the film crew might run into trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just an excuse I made for myself, as I wasn't entirely prepared for what might happen between Elliott and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'm quite busy as well. I'm going abroad for a week, and there's a lot of work to handle at the company. By the time you return from Louis City, I'll have some free time," Elliott said in a serious tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going abroad? With whom?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was nervous, fearing he might be taking Giselle along.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I never travel with someone of the opposite sex. Barry and a few executives are going with me," Elliott reassured me, seemingly understanding my concerns.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I relaxed, knowing that he wouldn't have any interaction with Giselle while he was away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's settled then," I said, taking a deep breath as if making a monumental decision.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eat up, the food is getting cold, Madeline."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone softened again, his voice captivating me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Elliott appears aloof, but he is quite adept at making girls happy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder those women pursued him in the past. He must have used this tone often with them. His voice is naturally husky, and combined with his gentle demeanor and handsome appearance, no one could resist his charm."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart raced as I lowered my head to enjoy the food on my plate.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="245.html">« Prev</a><a href="247.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
