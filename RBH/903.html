He began to wonder where the story was </span><span>going to end</span><span>:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, according to you, I've forgotten a lot of things, right? Madeline, before I lost my memory, what was our relationship like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conversation had been </span><span>easy</span><span> until he asked this question. Suddenly, the atmosphere between the three of us grew heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, I've been by his side. Though he was kept in the dark, I knew he was </span><span>truly</span><span> happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cherished every moment with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Quinn and I have to peel </span><span>off</span><span> the layers of truth, like peeling an onion, revealing the reality bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This process is </span><span>somehow</span><span> cruel for someone with amnesia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one </span><span>knew</span><span> how he </span><span>would</span><span> react or what might happen once he hear</span><span>d</span><span> the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since we've come this far, we have to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath and </span><span>gathered up</span><span> </span><span>some </span><span>courage:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott</span><span>, haven't you always wondered why my attitude towards you is so inconsistent? It's because, before your coma, we had already divorced, and it had been a long time. A lot of unpleasant things happened in between."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I </span><span>told him</span><span> the truth in one breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>an</span><span> instant, the coffee cup </span><span>Elliott</span><span> had just picked up slipped from his hand and crashed to the floor with a sharp sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coffee splashed onto his clothes and pants. The hot liquid </span><span>burned</span><span> him</span><span> into a</span><span> jolt, and he stood up abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was full of shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me, his expression changing rapidly. The veins on his forehead were visible, and his fists were clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he had heard the most </span><span>ridiculous</span><span> joke. After a long pause, he slowly looked at me, his eyes filled with a mix of self-mocking sarcasm:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what you're saying is, all this time, you weren't truly happy. You were just pretending to be a loving couple </span><span>for</span><span> me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like he had suddenly tasted something he </span><span>really disliked</span><span>. I knew that </span><span>Elliott</span><span> was struggling to </span><span>absorb</span><span> </span><span>the</span><span> truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>the </span><span>truth is</span><span> the</span><span> truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Jones said that only by </span><span>doing so</span><span> </span><span>can</span><span> your condition improve and your memory gradually return. </span><span>W</span><span>e didn't </span><span>mean to</span><span> </span><span>lie to</span><span> you. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought that once your memory came back, you'd understand everything on your own, and we wouldn't need to explain so much. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Quinn </span><span>spilled</span><span> it out this morning, and </span><span>I know you. I</span><span>t</span><span>&rsquo;s </span><span>impossible to keep it from you any longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a pang of guilt, so I tried to soften my tone </span><span>to prevent evoking any extreme emotions</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn then took over:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I spoke up because I knew this couldn't go on forever. I've searched a lot of domestic and international materials. Dr. Jones was </span><span>lying</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, even if </span><span>Madeline </span><span>continued to </span><span>keep your company</span><span>, your condition might not improve. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood clot is in your brain, and medication is unlikely to dissolve it. Surgery is too risky. If you remain amnesiac for life, it's unrealistic for Madeline to keep </span><span>acting </span><span>forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Jones was lying to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It</span><span> stunned me. I looked at him in disbelief:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, are you serious? Dr. Jones said that if I cooperated</span><span> and acted</span><span>, </span><span>he woul</span><span>d recover in about three months. How can this be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn nodded and gave me a bitter smile:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he didn't say </span><span>so</span><span>, </span><span>how can he keep</span><span> you stay</span><span>ing</span><span> by </span><span>Elliott</span><span>'s side? </span><span>I guess he</span><span> said three months because he thought </span><span>it</span><span> would be enough for you two to rekindle your feelings. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe you'd choose to </span><span>take him back</span><span> and keep this from him forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn'</span><span>s</span><span> words sent a shiver through me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, at first, I resisted the idea of helping </span><span>Elliott</span><span> recover. But as time </span><span>went</span><span>, I found my resistance fading. Sometimes, I genuinely enjoyed being with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never considered rekindling old feelings, but if this was all part of Dr. Jones' plan, who knows what might happen in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one can </span><span>completely</span><span> control their </span><span>feelings</span><span>, and </span><span>neither can I</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had loved</span><span> Elliott</span><span> for many years. The traits that </span><span>once </span><span>drew me to him still hold a lethal attraction for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I fall for him again, I'm afraid I will be deeply </span><span>involved</span><span>, unable to </span><span>pull </span><span>myself</span><span> out</span><span>. After all, his </span><span>care</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> me </span><span>in recent days</span><span> has been genuine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amnesia... it's a convenient excuse. It erases the </span><span>gap</span><span> that once seemed insurmountable, wipes away unpleasant memories, and brings two people who should never have been together closer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>not remembering</span><span> doesn't mean those things never happened. Elliott, I once </span><span>had doubts</span><span> </span><span>that</span><span> you </span><span>might be pretending to</span><span> lost memory, but I choose to believe you. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But</span><span> as I tell you this today, </span><span>I hope you </span><span>don't get too emotional</span><span> or</span><span> blame Madeline. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you must </span><span>find</span><span> someone</span><span> to take the fault</span><span>, blame yourself for hurting her so deeply before. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for </span><span>the details</span><span>, you can find out for yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn continued speaking slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span>'s eyes widened in shock. He stood </span><span>in shock</span><span> for a long time, then sat back down, ignoring the coffee stains on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't fake amnesia," he said, much calmer than I had feared. "I need some time to process what you've told me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Elliott like this, I felt a pang of pity. I patted his shoulder and said softly,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hey</span><span>, Barry knows everything. He's </span><span>the</span><span> assistant</span><span> you trusted most</span><span>. You can ask him</span><span> for more</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>OK</span><span>," he swallowed hard, glancing at me instinctively. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, is there anything else you </span><span>should</span><span> tell me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes </span><span>showed</span><span> a whirlwind of emotions, as if he'd been hit </span><span>really hard</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't bear to continue. I feared he wouldn't be able to handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Quinn</span><span>&rsquo;s </span><span>words made my heart skip a beat:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And also, my relationship with Madeline is actually..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="902.html">« Prev</a><a href="904.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
