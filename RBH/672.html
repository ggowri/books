Sylvia was also there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Quinn was locked out and couldn't come in for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Sylvia acted in time and smashed Nicole's head with a shoe, causing blood to flow profusely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Sylvia grabbed Nicole's hair directly and forcefully dragged her out of the compartment's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was terrified and stunned for two seconds before quickly reacting and then hurriedly walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Sylvia to be in the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that she would lend a hand to save me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole clearly did not expect there to be other people in the restroom. She covered the fresh blood oozing from her forehead and looked at Sylvia in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you get into the bathroom? How did you end up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had a stomachache, so I stayed here for almost an hour! Luckily, I had diarrhea, otherwise I wouldn't have known that you, an old woman, could be so cruel, actually using such harsh methods on a pregnant woman! Your daughter destroyed someone else's family and then turned around and said they ruined her happiness. No wonder your daughter has such despicable behavior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia said to Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know much about Sylvia before, I just saw her as one of the many women who had a fling with Elliott. But now that she has said these words, it suddenly makes me feel that she is quite straightforward and doesn't seem as bad as I imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole was left speechless by Sylvia's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at Sylvia in anger, while Sylvia stood directly in front of me and said to her, "I'll let you off the hook today, considering your age and the fact that you haven't caused any harm to her. However, you better leave immediately, or I might change my mind later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole used to think that I was pregnant, so she dared to be tough with me in the empty bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now I suddenly had a helper, and moreover, Sylvia was about the same height as me and had a fiery personality. With her around, Nicole clearly couldn't gain any advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching herself with no chance of success, there was a strong sense of unwillingness flickering in her eyes. However, she could only give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today she got lucky, but whether she will have such luck in the future is uncertain! Madeline, I'm putting it out there. As long as I live in this world, I will never let you go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole finished speaking and silently got up from the ground. She covered the wound on her head and opened the locked door with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn burst in suddenly. Upon seeing Sylvia, he was momentarily stunned, but then his gaze immediately locked onto me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened? Was that Nicole just now? Are you okay? What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't hesitate at all that it was the women's restroom. He immediately rushed in, and with his hand on my shoulder, he scrutinized me up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was fine, just a little scared, but luckily Ms. Hart showed up in time and helped. Ms. Hart, thank you so much for this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head and wiped the cold sweat off my forehead with lingering fear. I made </span><span>an effort to force a smile and then thanked Sylvia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to thank me. I just happened to be in the restroom. Otherwise, given the situation just now, it's hard to say what would have happened to you and the baby in your belly. The most terrifying thing about being human is this kind of recklessness. She still holds a lot of resentment toward you, so you must be careful in the future."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="671.html">« Prev</a><a href="673.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
