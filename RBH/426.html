I was actually thinking about finding a doctor to help with Austin's condition. Little did I know, Marcus is skilled in medicine, and he's our neighbor. What a stroke of luck. Marcus, I really owe you one," Lily said tearfully upon hearing Marcus' words. She hastily raised her glass to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, no need to thank me. It's just a small favor. Besides, we live nearby, so it's convenient," Marcus replied humbly, raising his glass in return and joining Lily for a drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were engrossed in conversation when Quinn's phone suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at the screen, he walked aside to take the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I knew it was Elliott on the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, Quinn approached me, patting my shoulder and gesturing for us to step aside for a private chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing up, we moved to the living room together. Quinn raised his phone, speaking softly. "Elliott's upset, asking where I am. He wants to know if I'm with you and demanded I send him the address. If I don't, he's threatening to cut ties. What should I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't expected Elliott to go this far. Furrowing my brows, I replied, "Don't send the address. I don't want him to know of my new place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, but he's furious on the phone. If I don't send it, we'll truly cut ties," Quinn sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you do, then we're not friends anymore. It's your call," I told Quinn, knowing he was in a tough spot but deliberately pressing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn couldn't help but chuckle, "What's with you two? Why is it that every time you two argue, the fallout lands on me? What did I do to deserve this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't argue with him. I just felt tired. Quinn, I don't want to waste my energy on this kind of ephemeral relationship anymore. If I have the time, I'd rather do something productive." I confided to Quinn, sharing my true feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I get it," Quinn said, understanding my message without further explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We returned to the table and enjoyed a cheerful lunch together. Then, Quinn and Marcus bid us farewell one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after they left, I headed to Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I stepped into the office, Adam eagerly handed me a stack of data reports.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face still beaming with excitement, he exclaimed, "Madeline, we've hit it big this time. Do Not Love is now topping the charts, securing the top viewership spot for the year. The buzz on Twitter and various online platforms has surpassed many big-budget productions. The entire industry is discussing and analyzing the reasons behind our show's immense popularity. Plus, many screenwriters have reached out to collaborate with us for IP development. We've definitely made the right moves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking the reports, I glanced at the dense array of numbers, feeling joyful.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="425.html">« Prev</a><a href="427.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
