I immediately ran to the window, pulled back the curtain, and saw </span><span>Elliott</span><span> still standing </span><span>right there </span><span>in the rain, holding </span><span>the </span><span>flowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What </span><span>was</span><span> he</span><span> doing</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why won't he leave in such heavy rain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I anxiously </span><span>banged</span><span> on the window, trying to urge him to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom walked over, still angry. She </span><span>shut </span><span>the curtain and said to me coldly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>He can stand in the rain as long as he wants!</span><span> He has nothing to do with </span><span>us</span><span> anymore. You swore you'd never </span><span>see</span><span> him again. Madeline, don't let his tricks </span><span>got you moved</span><span>. Remember, he didn't hesitate at all when he made you get a divorce!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom has always been gentle and had never been this furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear how much she now resented </span><span>Elliott</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understood that, though she didn't say it</span><span>. E</span><span>ver since Noah was born, she </span><span>treasured</span><span> him and felt even more sorrow for my past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, </span><span>she</span><span> fear</span><span>ed</span><span> that the Bryant family might use any means necessary to fight for Noah if they discovered </span><span>who </span><span>his </span><span>father was</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad also walked over, glanced deeply out the window, and then asked me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, does he know about Noah? </span><span>Last time h</span><span>is mom</span><span> came here and</span><span> </span><span>made</span><span> a scene, and now he's here. Are they trying to take Noah</span><span> from us</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, </span><span>just </span><span>let him in first. He's already in poor health. Last time in </span><span>Norch</span><span> City, he </span><span>was</span><span> severely injured and unconscious</span><span> for rescuing me</span><span>. If he keeps standing in the rain and something happens to him, we won't be able to </span><span>afford</span><span> </span><span>and explain to </span><span>the Bryant family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at my dad and said seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I</span><span>t was Quinn who led the rescue. Don't let him fool you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom quickly shook her head in denial when she heard what I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought it was Quinn too, but later I found out that Elliott got there before Quinn and </span><span>the rescue</span><span> team. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went </span><span>there </span><span>alone. When Quinn and the military arrived, Elliott had already been pushed down a slope by the kidnappers, so they didn't notice him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I explained the situation. Hearing this, my dad was stunned and asked me, half-believing:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Madeline, </span><span>are you sure about</span><span> this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded firmly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. He was severely injured and unconscious because of me. He still has a blood clot in his brain that can't be removed, causing memory loss. He only remembers the best times we had together. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dad, please let him in. I'm really afraid something might happen to him if he keeps standing out there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at my dad, my eyes pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, the storm raged on, with the sound of wind and rain howling like a beast, tearing at my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admit</span><span> that</span><span> I started to feel a bit of pity for </span><span>Elliott</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him stand out there, m</span><span>y heart </span><span>couldn&rsquo;t help but </span><span>ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I knew </span><span>him</span><span>. Once he </span><span>made a decision</span><span>, no one could </span><span>change it</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, </span><span>what </span><span>if he comes in and sees Noah? Noah looks so much like him. If he sees Noah, he'll </span><span>know</span><span> </span><span>it&rsquo;s his son</span><span>. What will we do then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom, despite her tough words, was soft-hearted. She wavered a bit but still hesitated </span><span>to let him in </span><span>because of Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let Malina take Noah to the nursery and keep him there. </span><span>Just let</span><span> Elliott in to get out of the rain. Mom, I know you hate him now, but he's still Noah's father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said, looking at my mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mother knows her daughter best. At that moment, my mom seemed to understand something from my eyes. She grabbed my shoulders and asked anxiously:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, be honest with me. Are you </span><span>having feelings for him again?</span><span> You can't </span><span>do that</span><span>! You can't stumble over the same stone twice. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, </span><span>Quinn </span><span>is </span><span>way much </span><span>better than him. He's </span><span>nice and so is</span><span> his famil</span><span>y. H</span><span>is parents treat you well, and they get along </span><span>well </span><span>with us. Don't make the same mistake again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I'm not. I'm not thinking about that right now. I just think it's not right for him to stand out there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, trying hard to hide my true feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then my</span><span> dad let out a heavy sigh:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let him come in first. The weather forecast says a typhoon might </span><span>be coming</span><span> tonight. If something happens to him at our </span><span>place</span><span>, we can't afford the consequences. The Bryant family might tear Madeline apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my dad's words, my mom finally nodded, agreeing to let </span><span>Elliott</span><span> in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of wind and rain grew louder outside. I quickly opened the door with an umbrella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> was still standing there, completely soaked. The once beautiful bouquet in his hands had been battered by the storm, but he stubbornly held onto it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind was too strong </span><span>to hold</span><span> the umbrella. I struggled to reach him, grabbed his cold fingers, and said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, come </span><span>in</span><span>. My parents agreed to let you in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span>'s dull eyes finally lit up. He looked at me and forced a difficult smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers were ice-cold, and rain slapped his face. </span><span>His</span><span> features look even more striking</span><span> with rain</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me getting wet too, he quickly shielded my head with his hand. Then, he followed me inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately shut the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, my mom brought out a clean towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring my own wet clothes, I hurried to wipe the water off his face and head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he stubbornly shook his head, took the towel from me, and started drying me first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Water had pooled on the floor, and </span><span>Elliott</span><span> was completely drenched. His lips were bloodless from the cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But</span><span> he stood tall and straight, gently drying me with a tender look in his eyes that made my heart </span><span>pounding</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pressed his hand down:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm </span><span>ok</span><span>. You're soaked. I'll </span><span>get you</span><span> some of my dad's clothes. Go take a hot shower and change."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, but I want to see your parents first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After drying me off, </span><span>Elliott</span><span> scanned the room and finally fixed his gaze on my silent parents sitting on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he ignored his drenched state, holding the battered bouquet, and walked resolutely toward my parents.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="908.html">« Prev</a><a href="910.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
