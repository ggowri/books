His nights are restless, almost sleepless, which is one of the reasons he's been hitting the bottle so often.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry stated, initially, Elliott drank merely to aid his sleep. But gradually, as time went on, his pain intensified, his head throbbing incessantly. He was forced to numb his senses with alcohol, just to get a decent night's sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry also mentioned that Elliott misses me nearly every day. He often zones out in his office, his phone screensaver is my picture, his computer screensaver is my picture, and even the items on his desk are all my pictures and my diary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every day after work, Elliott would pull out that diary, reading it over and over again. Then, he would sit alone, lost in thought for a long while.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a heads-up that I was heading to Norch City, so he had Barry pull some strings to get my flight details and booked the same flight as me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised me even more was that Elliott sat next to me not by chance, but out of concern for my safety on this trip to Norch City. He had gone as far as to install a GPS tracker on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, that day on the plane when I was asleep, he suddenly leaned over, claiming to search for his Bluetooth earbuds. His real intention was to slip a tiny tracker into my bag. He cleverly hid it in a secret compartment, a place I never paid attention to, so I never noticed it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found out I went to Ruini, all thanks to that tracker.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry shared, realizing I was in a dangerous place, Elliott abruptly left the crucial entrepreneurs' summit, driving recklessly all the way to Ruini, all by himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry stated, in all his years working for Elliott, he'd never seen him go so mad for anyone. Mad enough to disregard his own safety, to abandon all reason, and driven solely by his love for me, he took it upon himself to come find me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry also mentioned that when Elliott arrived in Ruini, he was frantic. He had tracked me down, realizing I was dangerously close to Mexico. Without a second thought, he reached out to Barry and immediately rented a dirt bike, chasing after me with all he had.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he had only one thought in his mind, no matter what, he had to save me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he ventured alone into the forest. No entourage, no notifications to anyone but Barry. Just him, swallowed by the wilderness...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear as day, he ran into Jade, and she wasn't alone. She had a whole crew with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was beaten up by the men Jade brought, who then pushed him and his car down the hillside. He had no idea that I had secretly contacted the military. As a result, they were unaware of his fall, missing the chance to rescue him. Consequently, no one knew he had been there too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Barry, who had been relentlessly tracking his whereabouts and hiring people to scour that stretch of forest, Elliott might have died there, unnoticed...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I found Mr. Bryant, he had been lying there for two days. His lips were pale, devoid of any color, and his body was riddled with injuries - on his head, hands, everywhere. He was weak, his body cold to the touch. If it weren't for the fruit tree next to where he had fallen, from which he had managed to grab some wild fruits to eat, I fear he might have... before I even found him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Barry, usually so composed, was surprisingly emotional. His eyes reddened, his voice choked up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Is it really him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing all this from Barry firsthand, I felt as if my blood had instantly frozen. It was as if I'd been struck by something heavy, and I collapsed onto the bed. My limbs went numb, my heartbeat abruptly stopped, and for a moment, I found it hard to breathe.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="756.html">« Prev</a><a href="758.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
