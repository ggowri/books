Clearly, he liked it as he picked up another piece and savored it in his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, Lily doesn't have much to do usually, her favorite thing is to study cooking. These dishes for lunch are all her specialty. This wine, Lily just made it, and its alcohol content is not high. How about you have a few drinks with me at noon?" Austin had a smile on his face, and I noticed that his expression had been relaxed since I entered the door until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could feel that he genuinely liked and was genuinely satisfied with Elliott from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin, since you said so, there is no reason for me not to accompany you for a drink," Elliott readily agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my eyebrows in surprise. "Haven't you always refrained from drinking alcohol at noon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I vividly remember that Elliott never drank alcohol at noon, which was one of his many rules. He never made an exception, no matter how important the meal was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Accompanying Austin for a drink, of course, can be an exception," Elliott smiled at me, his eyes deep and mysterious. I still couldn't see through what he was thinking, but his sincerity made my heart flutter slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily brought two vintage wine goblets, and Austin uncorked the bottle of wine. The fragrance of the wine filled the entire room immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott took a sip and immediately praised, "Lily, this wine is indeed very palatable, smooth and sweet. How did you make it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This homemade wine, when drunk, not only warms the stomach but also does no harm to the body. Austin loves drinking, and I'm afraid he might harm himself, so I make some every year, allowing Austin to have a little sip," Lily said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott took another sip, and it was evident that he really enjoyed drinking this wine. He smiled and exclaimed, "Lily, I never knew before, you are so skilled, so hidden."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sounded like flattery, but more than that, they came from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in the past, every time I invited him to come to my house for a meal, he would always make various excuses or refuse. Back then, unless it was absolutely necessary, he couldn't be bothered to step foot in my house. Even when he saw Austin's mom, it was just basic, polite formalities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he had never thought about integrating into my family and getting to know my parents, so he didn't know that Lily was so virtuous and that Austin had such diverse interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even later, he only went to Giselle's house for a meal once, and he couldn't stop praising the home-cooked dishes made by Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just an ordinary home-cooked dish, far inferior to Lily's cooking skills. However, in Elliott's eyes at that time, he loved Giselle, so he also respected Nicole. Even the ordinary dish made by Nicole was considered top-notch cuisine in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about his past life and all the things he had done to Giselle and her family, and now seeing him sitting in front of my parents, drinking the wine made by Lily and eating the food cooked by Lily, I felt even more bewildered. In addition to the bewilderment, I also felt a sense of inexplicable irony.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="182.html">« Prev</a><a href="184.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
