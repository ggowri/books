Even the arrangement of the water features in the courtyard was remarkably similar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed his parents shared similar interests with mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn tugged at my arm, pulling me into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I must say, it was much larger than I had imagined, and the interior seemed to have been renovated in recent years. Instead of appearing antiquated, it exuded a very contemporary, trendy vibe, reflecting the popular modern style of decoration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Mom, Madeline's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the oppressive atmosphere at Elliott's home, Quinn's family gave me a sense of openness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't have many servants, so the house felt spacious. As soon as Quinn stepped in, he called out loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Quinn's father, Alexander, and his mother, Jessica, came rushing out of the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was my first time meeting Quinn's parents. Alexander was tall and robust, evidently well-maintained, while Jessica, though not tall, had a well-proportioned figure and a lovely face, appearing quite youthful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were dressed casually, without any pomp, and Jessica's face lit up with a radiant smile when she saw me. She immediately grabbed my hand, saying, "You must be Madeline, right? Come in. Quinn has mentioned you before, and today we finally meet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her warm tone instantly eased my previously guarded heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had anticipated this meeting to be as uncomfortable as with Elliott's parents or for them to speak down to me, but Jessica was so welcoming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, her demeanor reminded me a lot of Lily's, which instantly relaxed me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I signaled to Quinn to hand over some supplements I brought with me, saying, "Hello, it's my first visit, and I wasn't sure what you might like, so I bought some supplements. I hope you don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cute kid, just having you here is enough. There's no need for gifts, besides, we have everything at home. You don't need to be so formal in the future," Jessica said, pulling me along with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite it being our first meeting, she affectionately took my hand and guided me to the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Quinn followed suit, sitting opposite us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I politely smiled at Alexander, and to my surprise, he smiled back warmly, even jovially. "Quinn hasn't brought any girls home in so many years. This is the first time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, remarkably amiable, without a hint of seniority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also noticed they had placed several fruit platters on the coffee table, all filled with fresh fruit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced casually, and Jessica, thinking I might want some, handed me a plate of cherries, saying, "Madeline, have some. These are imported cherries we specially bought this morning. Since you're pregnant, eating them will supplement your iron intake, which is good for the baby."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="536.html">« Prev</a><a href="538.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
