What happened? Tell me where you are. I'll rush over right away!" Carole said. Her anxiety spiked upon hearing about Quinn's injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're currently at People's Hospital of Carthage, and for now, we're safe. His injuries are under control. But Carthage is under complete lockdown now. You might not be able to get in. If there's anything, just contact me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carthage is under lockdown? Isn't it dangerous inside now? No, I'll find a way to get there. Please take care of my brother until I arrive. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole was probably the kind of decisive woman. She concluded the call and hung up immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn remained in slumber while Adam and I managed to steal a moment downstairs. The hospital corridors were still bustling with patients, among whom were elderly and children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medical staff and volunteers were busy. Some elderly patients groaned on the floor while some mothers cried uncontrollably, distraught by their children's high fevers. Some patients, perhaps already deceased upon arrival, were shrouded in white sheets as their families wailed nearby... It was a scene straight out of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It pained me deeply, my body trembling uncontrollably, tears streaming down my cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My sorrow wasn't because of my helplessness. It was knowing that I had the means to save them, yet the lack of recognition for the newly introduced medication hindered its adoption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I must find a way to change this situation," I thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rushed back upstairs, returning to Quinn's ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood guard by Quinn's side for over three hours, continuously monitoring him. Finally, the flush on his face began to fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I reached out and touched his forehead, noticing that his temperature had significantly dropped compared to before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly summoned Quinn's attending physician and the hospital's director, pointing at Quinn as I said, "Dr. Muller, Dr. Thomas, the anti-flu capsules I brought are effective against this virus. I just gave my friend two pills, and his fever has subsided significantly. Don't believe me? Check for yourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David reluctantly fetched a thermometer and measured Quinn's temperature, but he just scoffed, "It's dropped a bit, but he still has a temperature of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on this alone, we can't determine if this medication works. In my opinion, you're delaying Mr. Woods' treatment. It's safer to administer antibiotics."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Mayers, everyone in the hospital is swamped, and we simply don't have the resources to gamble with your new medication. If something goes wrong, none of us can bear the consequences! I agree with Dr. Thomas. We should administer antibiotics to Mr. Woods immediately. Otherwise, we can't take responsibility for any complications with his fever persisting like this!" Oliver chimed in, clearly unconvinced about the anti-flu capsule's effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn! Quinn, where are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to persuade them further, but a cold, authoritative voice echoed in the hallway just then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a short-haired woman dressed in a black coat and boots stormed into the room. As soon as she entered, her overwhelming presence left everyone stunned.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="518.html">« Prev</a><a href="520.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
