Quinn had mentioned him to me during our chat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Fiona and I both knew Paige's personality well. Despite her carefree and outgoing nature, she had never slept with anyone. Now that she had a relationship with Philip, she must be finding it hard to accept.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can he be so irresponsible? He can't just trample over Paige's dignity. Is he planning to keep delaying things?" I exclaimed, feeling a surge of anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexis mentioned he'd help me find out Philip's stance, but I have a feeling Paige might actually have feelings for him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you say that?" I inquired.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While she's had relationships before, she's never been this distraught for anyone. Lately, she's even lost her appetite and has become noticeably thinner. If she didn't like Philip, would her emotions be affected by him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I agreed with Fiona's assessment. After all, Philip was indeed the type Paige would be attracted to. He was righteous, stylish, came from a respectable background, and was decent in both appearance and profession. Besides his penchant for dating, Philip had almost no other faults.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll talk to Quinn and have him have a chat with Philip. This situation can't be dragged out any longer," I stated firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, my phone rang unexpectedly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Picking up the phone, I saw a message from Giselle, her tone indicating strong displeasure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Why did you go to my boyfriend's workplace? What are you trying to do?]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She skipped formalities. Her arrogant attitude instantly dampened my mood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chose not to engage with her, replying with just a question mark, leaving her to guess my thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle quickly responded, her tone still irritable: [Let's meet up. I'm heading to the law firm now to find you.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to see her, so I swiftly replied to her message: [There's no need. Whatever you have to say, say it online.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[I'm out of the hospital. There's a caf&eacute; below the law firm, I'll be waiting there. If you want to know Cormac's opinion of you, come over.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's insistence on meeting took me aback. Furthermore, to entice me, she dangled a bait.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cormac's opinion of me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that line, I knew she had something to say. Since Giselle was so eager to provoke me, I decided to meet her and see what she had in mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, I informed Fiona that I had something to attend to. Fiona coincidentally needed to return to the hospital to organize some documents.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, we left Alexis's law firm together, and I headed straight to the caf&eacute;.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="250.html">« Prev</a><a href="252.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
