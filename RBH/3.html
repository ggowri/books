Back then, Elliott was busy with a starlet and Giselle slipped under my radar. </p><p>The department was huge and buzzing with people, but Giselle stood out. </p><p>She was tall, pale with long hair, and big eyes on her oval face. Her oversized, cheap business attire didn&#x27;t hide her beauty. </p><p>My first impression of Giselle was like a delicate, innocent white rose in the wind. </p><p>She was presenting her case in the director&#x27;s office, full of hope. But it wasn&#x27;t what he wanted. He glanced at it and angrily tossed it back at her, scolding her fiercely. </p><p>Now, she was just a newbie at a big firm, trying to impress her boss. This harsh criticism must&#x27;ve hurt. </p><p>Maybe this was what drove her to Elliott, climbing to the top step by step. </p><p>Little did anyone know that this girl being berated would, in a few years, become Elliott&#x27;s wife and change her destiny.</p><p>&quot;Excuse me, madam. What can I do for you?&quot;</p><p>A woman in business attire came up to me and asked me with a bright smile.</p><p>Only then did I realize that I had kept looking at Giselle, seeming fascinated, which wasn&#x27;t myself. Fortunately, I rarely came to the group and had never met these employees, so they didn&#x27;t know me.</p><p>&quot;Nothing. I wanted to discuss some business with your director. Since he is busy, I&#x27;ll leave then.&quot;</p><p>With a random excuse, I turned around and left.</p><p>I didn&#x27;t mean to meet Giselle. I just wanted to see her at this time.</p><p>I was so curious about how the inconspicuous Giselle managed to catch Elliott&#x27;s eye, sleep with him, and occupy his mind step by step. She even gained the favor and recognition of his parents!</p><p>She was a recent college graduate with nothing special. How did she do that?</p><p>In my past life, I was clueless about Giselle until she had already won over Elliott, surpassing all his past flings. </p><p>Ignoring his family&#x27;s protests, Elliott asked me for a divorce multiple times for her. He even promoted the young Giselle, despite board objections, to aid him with the Bryant Group&#x27;s confidential matters. He trusted her more than anyone else. </p><p>By the time I dug into Giselle&#x27;s background, Elliott was head over heels for her. </p><p>How did an average girl from a common family with no extraordinary education earn all of Elliott&#x27;s devotion? </p><p>Her looks couldn&#x27;t be the reason; Elliott had been with many beautiful women. Her beauty wasn&#x27;t her secret weapon.</p><p>I remembered Giselle&#x27;s last words to me before I died. </p><p><em>&quot;Can&#x27;t you see? The more you beg, the less they respect you.&quot; </em></p><p>She was young but sensible. </p><p>Could her sensibility be what captivated Elliott?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="2.html">« Prev</a><a href="4.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
