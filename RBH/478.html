Then, his body lurched, and he collapsed towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's towering figure fell towards me like a mountain. My frail body couldn't handle it, but Marcus, sensing something was wrong, quickly rushed forward and caught Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no, he's passed out!" Marcus exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus' cry, I froze. Sweat instantly covered my forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly asked, "Marcus, what should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "Let's take him to my place first. I'll figure something out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, being a former soldier, was strong. Despite Elliott's large frame, Marcus managed to carry him swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurried to keep up, supporting Elliott along the way. Soon, we were back at Marcus' house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laid Elliott down on the couch, and I helped him take off his shoes. Marcus first checked his eyes, then pressed on various points on Elliott's head and arms. Finally, he pinched Elliott's nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott opened his eyes, subconsciously took in his surroundings, and was about to speak, but another violent fit of coughing overtook him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, conserve your energy. You're too weak right now, and you have a fever. You should rest and not talk for now," Marcus advised, seeing the state Elliott was in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was worried about the baby in my belly and feared Elliott might have caught a new influenza, so I didn't dare get too close. Instead, I pulled Marcus aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, this cold seems severe. It's not like his usual colds. His health has always been excellent. Elliott hardly ever gets sick. This time, his illness is so serious. Do you think he might have caught some new kind of new virus?" I cautiously inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus furrowed his brow, pondered for a moment, and then said, "I heard recently that there's been a major flu outbreak in coastal areas like Catage. The hospitals are overflowing, and there are quite a few critical patients. Some have even developed complications due to lack of timely treatment and have died."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give him some anti-flu capsules. See if that helps?" I asked tentatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at Elliott on the couch, Marcus replied in a low voice, "If it's a viral flu, the anti-flu capsules should work. But I only have one box at home, and I've given it to you. I'll prepare some medicine based on the anti-flu capsule's ingredients. After that, he should take the medicine. It'll be more effective. Let him rest here tonight. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Then I won't leave tonight. I'll stay to take care of him," I immediately responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll go prepare the medicine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus promptly went upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found a medical mask in Marcus' cabinet and put it on before approaching the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was still lying there. Despite his cold, he only wore a thin black undershirt and a light grey sweater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The temperature outside was already below freezing. He was already sick, and standing at my door in the cold wind had worsened his condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but sigh. Quickly grabbing the blanket from the couch, I covered him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I reached out to feel Elliott's forehead, which was still burning hot. I thought, "It has been a few days since he caught a cold. If it were just a common cold, Elliott should have been better by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems like he has likely caught a new flu."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="477.html">« Prev</a><a href="479.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
