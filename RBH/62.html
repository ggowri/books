Afterward, he struggled to pick up my phone while carrying me on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I faintly heard him shouting:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, do you fucking remember that you have a wife? If you want to be with Madeline, then be wholeheartedly devoted to her! If you don't want to be with her, there are plenty of people who do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hmm... It seems like this is the first time in so many years that someone has had my back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know before, but Quinn actually had such a handsome side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did he suddenly become so nice to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you... you were still good to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay on his shoulder and couldn't help but mutter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another wave of drunkenness swept over me. I felt my entire head buzzing. I was lying on top of him. By this time, I was completely unconscious. I had no idea where I was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, when I woke up, I found myself not at home, but on a large bed in a hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was quiet and there was a faint scent. My clothes had been changed into pajamas. And on the bedside table, there was a brand new set of sportswear, a note, and a brand new phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did I end up here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat up subconsciously. I rubbed my sore head. Then, I vaguely recalled what happened last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Quinn arrange for me to be here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hesitantly picked up the note. On the note were a few lines of casually written large characters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The clothes were changed by the waiter at my request. The sportswear was specially bought for you by me. Your phone's screen was broken last night, so I took it to get repaired for you. You can use this new phone for now. I have already changed the SIM card for you. - Quinn"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was probably afraid that I would misunderstand. So he explained a lot on the note.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat up from the bed. Then, I picked up the pink sportswear set that was placed by the bed. After I walked into the bathroom and changed into this sportswear set, I found that the size of this sportswear set fit me well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this soft and pink color was something I had never tried before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Quinn quite careful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, how did he know what size I wore?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but "mutter" in my heart. And soon, I also noticed that he not only prepared clothes and a mobile phone for me. Moreover, he specially prepared a hangover pill and a bottle of mineral water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I haven't drunk alcohol for a long time. The feeling of a hangover indeed made me feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I grabbed that hangover pill and swallowed it with water. Then, I opened my phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phone was brand new. The SIM card was still the same one I had before. I logged into WhatsApp on my phone. I found that I had several unread messages, including ones from Quinn and Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn sent a picture. In the picture, I was hunched over the toilet, looking extremely disheveled as I vomited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along with the picture, there is a sentence "You shouldn't drink so much alcohol in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Elliott sent was only a few words: "How dare you stay out all night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at the time when Elliott sent the message. It was around midnight last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his words, it seems that he had already returned to Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shouldn't he have been with Giselle at the hospital last night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would he be willing to go back when they were having such a great time chatting?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know why, but whenever I think of Elliott and Giselle, my heart becomes complicated. And just at that moment, Elliott seemed to have a telepathic connection and suddenly dialed my phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rarely called me before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the number of times he sent me messages was very few, very few.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He has never replied or liked any of my WhatsApp messages. In fact, he might have never even seen them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his WhatsApp, it was always a constant blank. He rarely posted any updates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her memory, over the years, he had only posted one update on WhatsApp. That was when he was forced by the organizers to share a tournament message after winning a basketball game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I frowned as I looked at the flashing name "Elliott" on the screen. I hesitated for a moment, but in the end, I answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="61.html">« Prev</a><a href="63.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
