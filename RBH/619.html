Since Giselle became pregnant, all the information was provided by Louis, and it was also he who diagnosed that I couldn't get pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to his diagnosis, it was impossible for me to get pregnant. However, I did get pregnant, which indicated that he played tricks on my diagnosis. At the very least, he exaggerated the fact that I couldn't get pregnant, which led to Elliott's parents and grandfather no longer expecting me to get pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he was able to play tricks on my diagnosis report, perhaps he could also play tricks on the paternity test for the child in Giselle's belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great. Thank you, Fiona. It's my turn to perform now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and winked at Fiona. Then, I squeezed through the crowd and walked over to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Giselle saw me, she was greatly surprised. She stumbled and fell backward. Fortunately, she managed to grab onto the railing in time, or she would have fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her actions startled the onlookers, and Nicole screamed as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott also saw me. When he saw that it was me, a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes. He seemed to have something to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I said to Giselle, "Giselle, come down. You have just given birth and need to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My tone was calm and emotionless, but Giselle didn't believe my sudden concern. She furrowed her brows and looked at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what are you doing here? Is it you who has been encouraging Elliott to send me and the child abroad? It must be you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. But instead of sending you abroad, I would rather you die. If you die, the grudges between the three of us will cease to exist. There will be no more obstacles between Elliott and me. As for your son, rest assured that I will treat him as my own son. You can leave without any worries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that Giselle used suicide as a threat to Elliott, so I deliberately said these words to provoke her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, upon hearing my words, Giselle immediately became excited and stared at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, stop dreaming! That was my child. I wouldn't leave him with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you think so, why do you want to die then? If you die, I will be very happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I crossed my hands and calmly watched her, causing her plan to fail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's face turned pale instantly. Her purpose in acting was to force Elliott to propose to her. However, she didn't expect me to show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott immediately understood what I meant and said to Giselle, "If you come down now, I might consider not sending you and the child abroad. But if you commit suicide, everything Madeline said might come true. Giselle, think about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle stood by the railing, torn between two choices. She looked at Elliott pitifully. Until that moment, she continued to gaze at Elliott with hope, never giving up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you agreed to get engaged with me, I would come down."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="618.html">« Prev</a><a href="620.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
