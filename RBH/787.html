But back then, no matter how carefully I prepared, Elliott never so much as glanced at the birthday feasts I arranged for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd rather celebrate with his gang of friends than have a private birthday bash with me at Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when I walked into the club with a cake in hand, wishing Quinn a "Happy Birthday," Quinn first looked surprised for a few seconds, then was so touched that his eyes reddened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, how are you so thoughtful?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hastily took the gift from my hands, then affectionately pinched my nose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only realized it was your birthday today when I saw your sister's post. I made this cake myself. These shoes are the latest from your favorite brand. I'm not sure if you'll like them."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched as he was moved, and I couldn't help but flash him a warm smile, winking playfully.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I love your gift. Your timing couldn't be more perfect. A few friends were just about to celebrate my birthday. I didn't invite you initially, considering you've just had a baby. Plus, your mom was adamant about not disturbing your rest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn took the gift and handed it to the waiter standing by. Then, he wrapped his arm around me and led me into the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The early summer was creeping in. Fresh from childbirth, I was still clad in a silver-grey cardigan over a simple white T-shirt, paired with black capris. Casual canvas shoes completed my look.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had only planned on seeing Quinn, so I didn't bother with makeup. Compared to the dolled-up girls in the room, I suddenly felt a bit plain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, I've just had a baby, and my figure is still a bit out of shape. Plus, my belly hasn't fully tightened up yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the other girls in the room, a pang of inferiority naturally crept into my heart in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, who's this lady?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the room, a crisp yet coquettish voice echoed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I paused for a moment, pinpointing the direction of the voice. Instantly, I recognized it - it was Zara Moore, Quinn's cousin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We've clearly met before at Quinn's place. Yet now, she's acting as if she doesn't know me. I can't tell if she's genuinely forgotten who I am.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my girlfriend, Madeline Mayers. Zara, you've met her at my place before, remember?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn casually draped his arm over my shoulder, boldly declaring to them that I was his girlfriend. Despite the fact that we had never officially defined our relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey there. Today's Quinn's birthday, and I've whipped up a cake especially for the occasion. Later on, we can all have a taste."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a slight smile, not bursting Quinn's bubble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little beauties seated in the room wilted like flowers under a scorching sun, their spirits instantly deflated upon hearing Quinn and my words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave the girls a cool, appraising look. It seemed they all had a thing for Quinn. Each one of them had gone all out with their outfits. Moreover, the table was littered with all sorts of gifts. Clearly, they were all here to celebrate Quinn's birthday.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among these girls, Zara Moore is definitely the most stunning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Youth is indeed a woman's best makeup. Her skin was as white as snow, her features as delicate as a painting. She wore a light pink off-the-shoulder sleeveless dress, its fluffy hem accentuating her charming allure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept her gaze fixed on me, her eyes brimming with hostility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys carry on, I'll be right back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn gestured for me to sit, then hurried out as if he had pressing matters to attend to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, settling myself into a corner of the room. No sooner had I taken a seat, another woman entered the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then she appeared, leaving me utterly dumbstruck. I never would have guessed that she would be the one to show up.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="786.html">« Prev</a><a href="788.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
