It had been a long time since I had seen him lose his temper so dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was still weak. After his outburst, Elliott began to cough violently once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, hearing the argument, was thrown into a panic. He rushed downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a bout of intense coughing, Elliott finally stopped. His eyes were bloodshot as he looked at me. I couldn't tell if it was from coughing or from sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me reiterate. I'm not stealing your partnership opportunities. The market is just that big, and everyone wants to maximize their gains," I said, standing up to face Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being significantly shorter than him, I refused to back down in terms of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "I didn't do anything wrong! Yes! I took his business partner, so what? What can he do about it? He owes me too much in this life and the last."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I met his gaze with equal intensity. My straightforward words left Elliott speechless for a long while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at me, seemingly taken aback. Perhaps in his memory, I had always been submissive. Now, with my sudden assertiveness, he seemed uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I see that you've changed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just realizing that I've changed now?" I chuckled bitterly. Looking into his eyes, I bit my lip and said, "I changed a long time ago, Elliott. I'm no longer the woman who only knew how to love you and revolve around you every day. Instead of blaming me for snatching your partnerships, why don't you blame yourself for not noticing sooner and giving me the chance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My blunt words left Elliott stunned once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instinctively took a step back, unable to comprehend the magnitude of my transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't fail to notice. I considered you my wife, my family. I thought that's what you wanted all along..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're about to have a child with someone else soon, so how are we still a family? Moreover, there's no connection between Glory Group and Bryant Group, is there?" I glared at him, questioning fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott took another step back in shock. Clutching his chest, he coughed violently again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Glory Group and Bryant Group aren't the same. But over the years, I've helped Glory Group a lot. Yes, I admit that Giselle's child was a huge blow to you, but that wasn't my choice. How can you blame me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face flushed red, contorted in agony. Perhaps the virus hadn't completely left his body, leaving him physically drained as he slumped onto the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gasped for air, with his emotions fluctuating intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him in this state, I felt bad. But since we had come this far in our conversation, I chose to lay everything out on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You helped Glory Group because my family gave your family that two billion dollars during their time of need. Just as your mother said, you balanced the scales after you family's assistance to Glory Group. From now on, you don't owe me, and I don't owe you. We're even! As for the collaboration between Glory Group and Bryant Group... Give me some time. After the holidays, I will find another partner and completely cut ties with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Elliott with unwavering determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never been this firm in front of him before. Over the years, I had almost never mentioned that two billion dollars out of fear of hurting his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that we were parting ways, I decided to lay it all out to prevent any feelings of indebtedness between us.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="483.html">« Prev</a><a href="485.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
