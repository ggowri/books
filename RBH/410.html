He was half-leaning against the headboard, scrolling through something on his phone with a furrowed brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opening my eyes, I saw Elliott beside me. Memories of last night rushed back, giving me a surreal feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I struggled to sit up hastily and instinctively rubbed my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to me as he noticed that I was awake with a faint smile gracing his lips, and in a gentle voice, he said, "You're awake? You slept like a log."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I gazed at him, my mind gradually cleared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing once again that I was lying beside him without understanding how, I instinctively rose from the bed. I immediately adopted a tone of detachment as I thanked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for last night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression faltered for a moment, and he set aside his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we really so distant as to need formalities? We're married, you know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My hands slipped into my pockets, and I shrugged knowingly. Despite knowing my words might unsettle him, I couldn't help but speak my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps it's best to keep some distance, especially since you're about to become a father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's previously amiable expression darkened instantly. He lowered his gaze, his eyes shadowed with a hint of disappointment as he muttered softly, "Was it necessary to bring that up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled lightly, choosing not to dwell on it further, and turned to the bathroom to freshen up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until I had clarity on the matter of the child, I wouldn't allow myself to entertain any fantasies about Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for the sudden turn of events last night and his timely arrival, there was no way I would have shared a bed with him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must have understood my state of mind after our conversation that day. So, last night, he didn't push me further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He likely knew that there was a barrier between us now, and it was something that made it impossible for us to be as close as we once were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in my thoughts, I brushed my teeth, but my movements halted abruptly when I heard Elliott's phone ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know who was calling him, but I distinctly heard him discussing work on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, ensure your department handles the publicity and PR for Allure well. The show premieres next Monday. We need to be vigilant during this crucial period, and there can't be any negative publicity whatsoever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My brushing paused momentarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My show, Do Not Love, was airing its final episode this Sunday, and Allure was set to premiere the following Monday?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed they had finalized their collaboration with Netflix. How swift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the emphasis on avoiding negative publicity might disappoint Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing my dental routine, I returned the toothbrush to its place and immediately clicked on my chat with Ken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since our last dinner, Ken had been gradually sending me a series of scandals about Jezebel, from her school days to the present, all of which he had meticulously collected and forwarded to my phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through these revelations, I discovered that Jezebel, the seemingly innocent and aloof girl, had many facets hidden beneath her facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During high school, she began crafting her Ms. Perfect persona. However, the reality was quite different. Her mother, a high-profile socialite, had exposed her to various high-end social events and introduced her to wealthy men from a young age. She portrayed herself as being connected to a certain industry mogul, whom she referred to as her godfather. But the truth was, there were unclear dynamics between her, her mother, and even the so-called godfather.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="409.html">« Prev</a><a href="411.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
