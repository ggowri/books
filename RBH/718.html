He just called me and said he's very grateful for my referral," Marcus asked me joyfully over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, yes, it has been signed, and I will make sure the finance department transfers the money to his account as soon as possible," I said with a smile over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good, now his heart can be at ease. He told me that he has already gone back to Mexico to film. My proposal has been completed, have you returned to the company? I want to discuss it with you," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus is also a person who gets things done when it comes to work. We had just mentioned this matter, and he had already prepared the project plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On my way back to the office, that's perfect. We are going to have a management meeting later, so you can directly present your project proposal during the meeting. We can all discuss it together," I immediately said into the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after such a long time of exploration in the business field, I have become adept at my work and my thoughts in my mind have become increasingly clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the memories of the past few years, it feels as if I have gained the ability to foresee the future. Therefore, in many decisions and choices, I can achieve twice the result with half the effort, without the need for hesitation or confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty minutes later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meeting started on time, and Marcus also arrived at the scene. He handed me the </span><span>project proposal he had prepared, and after quickly browsing through it, I already had an idea in my mind. I then said to him, "You go have coffee in my office first, and after we have discussed it thoroughly, I will talk to you in detail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly walked into the conference room, and the executives of my company had already gathered in the room. Each of them had their own notebooks. When they saw me coming in, they all stood up respectfully and shouted in unison, "Ms. Mayers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please have a seat, everyone. Let's begin the meeting," I nodded slightly and, after scanning the room with a sharp gaze, I sat with a dignified air in the center of the conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I took over Glory Group, apart from Isaac and Katrina, the two senior executives, I gradually eliminated all of Austin's former subordinates and rehired a fresh and young group of employees to replace them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I entrusted Adam with full responsibility for the film and television industry, and assigned Isaac to handle the mechanical tasks of Glory Group, his original field. In addition, upon Adam's recommendation, I hired a professional woman named Jane to take charge of the pharmaceutical sector of Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was around 35 years old, with short hair and black-framed glasses. She was slim and agile, not very tall, about 5 feet. She had worked for a large pharmaceutical company for over ten years, starting from the grassroots level and eventually reaching a middle-level position. However, due to internal conflicts within the company, she was forced to leave and sent her resume to our company. After Adam interviewed her, he thought she was a great person and recommended her for a second interview. She has been with Glory Group for about three months now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her working style, just like her personality, was efficient and decisive. Several medicines that Marcus and I collaborated on were quickly embraced by the market under her skilled marketing operations. Despite our medicines being much more expensive than others, they quickly gained a foothold in the market due to their significant efficacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is precisely because I had those few medicines as a foundation that I dared to take risks and make new attempts with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I directly threw Marcus's project proposal to her and asked her to explain it to everyone at the meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She received the proposal and quickly skimmed through it in less than two minutes. Soon, she started explaining directly from the PPT.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="717.html">« Prev</a><a href="719.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
