Immediately, she brought me dinner, but I didn't have much of an appetite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ate a little bit and picked up my phone to check the time. It was already past 7 o'clock in the evening, and Elliott hadn't arrived yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was lying alone in the hospital bed, feeling a bit bored. I thought about getting up and walking around, but Bonnie said the doctor had instructed me to stay in bed and rest for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no choice but to pick up my phone and boredly scroll through various apps. As I was scrolling, I suddenly came across a post on Instagram by Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no picture, only one line of text: "It was truly the darkest day in history."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence sounds like her mood seemed particularly bad, I don't know what happened exactly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I clicked on her profile picture, originally wanting to see what was going on, but unexpectedly, in an instant, she deleted that Instagram post.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What exactly did they go through that made them so emotional?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity arose in my mind, and at that moment, Quinn suddenly sent me a photo with a message attached: "Guess who I ran into?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened the photo he sent and saw in a dimly lit bar, a girl with a ponytail sitting with two boys. This girl was wearing a black tank top and had a slender figure, resembling Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And sitting next to her were two boys, one was Rowan, and the other was clearly my assistant Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she go to the bar to drink with Rowan and Adam?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My gossip-loving heart quickly ignited, and I hastily sent a message: "Quinn, where is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn immediately replied to me, "At Kir Bar, Giselle drank a lot of alcohol and seemed to be in a bad mood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn seemed to know that I was somewhat bothered by Giselle, but he didn't expose my thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately dialed Adam's phone number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the phone rang for a while, Adam answered the call. As expected, there was some noise on his end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked me over the phone, "Madeline, why did you call me? Yesterday when I called you, your husband answered and said that you were sick and needed rest. He asked me not to disturb you for a few days due to official matters. Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam asked in one breath over the phone, appearing very concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, I'm fine, I just wanted to ask how the progress of the filming in Louis City is going. Where are you right now?" I casually asked, making up an excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, everything was normal. The director said our leading actress had great potential and could nail her performances in one take. Madeline, take care of yourself and don't worry, I've got everything under control. I'm currently at a bar with my friends, Rowan and Giselle, you know them," Adam said in one breath over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, how come you are with both of them?" I asked curiously once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam has always been open with me, and he quickly said, "Ah, it seems like Giselle is being scapegoated at work. Her superiors are pushing all the blame onto her, and she feels very wronged. She asked Rowan and me to comfort her. She drank quite a bit tonight, and neither Rowan nor I could persuade her to stop."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was being scapegoated at work?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems to be about the exhibition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was she who volunteered to take charge of this exhibition in the first place, which must have already made her superior, Amy, quite unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this time, such a mistake occurred again. Given Elliott's personality, he would definitely hold the entire company accountable. It seems that Amy decided to let Giselle take the blame.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="171.html">« Prev</a><a href="173.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
