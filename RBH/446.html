However, my intuition told me that she was Jezebel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a public hospital. Moreover, you enjoyed the VIP treatment at Bryant Hospital. So, there is a big difference between here and there. But you suddenly had a stomachache. I advised you not to drink last night, but you ignored me. Do you realize you were wrong now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel muttered in a low voice, but I heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a pregnant, how dared Giselle drink last night? I felt unbelievable after listening to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because I'm too upset about you. If I miss this opportunity, the show will probably not be launched. The Bryant Group invested so much money, but it will probably end in vain. How can I explain to Elliott? I dared not to face him and his parents now. If I am not pregnant, they would definitely blame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Giselle didn't notice me. Sitting in the empty seats in the row behind me, they started chatting quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect something like this to happen either. I didn't know who was behind it. What's worse, everything I had done in the past had been exposed. Giselle, you must help me find out who was behind it. I will definitely not let her go. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Undoubtedly, it must have been done by your rival. It is the normality of the entertainment industry, always full of competition and conspiracy. Compared with finding out who was behind it, how to make up for it is the most important and urgent thing. Didn't you date with Mr. Hall last time? Can you ask him out again? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle said with some impatience on her face. However, I couldn't help pressing my lips after hearing her suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had the intimate photos of Rickson and Jezebel in my hand. However, Rickson was famous for his deep love for his wife in the entertainment industry. He was indeed a playboy, but he still showed that he loved his wife and his family in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he would never be cheated by Jezebel a second time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, I heard Jezebel complain soon,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. Mr. Hall refuses to answer my calls and to reply to my text messages. Obviously, he is trying every means to avoid me. How can I ask him out? Giselle, please try again to persuade Mr. Bryant to air this drama. The Bryant family has a strong background. With his help, the problem should be easily solved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you think so? He had no intention of choosing you as the heroine. I strongly recommended you, so he agreed to it. Now, your scandal has been exposed. How can I dare to ask him for help? What's worse, he has been particularly indifferent to me recently. And even he is unwilling to meet me. So, I have no other choice now but wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle also complained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so worried about this matter that she went to drink regardless of the child in her belly. It could show that it had caused her a lot of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is really going for wool and come home shorn. You deserve it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help cursing harshly in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Fiona came out from inside. Unknowing Giselle and Jezebel were also there, she shouted directly at me,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, hurry up! It's your turn!
