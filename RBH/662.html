And you don't look too well either. Have you not been resting well lately?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Lily's somewhat haggard face, I immediately became nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fool, I am already in my sixties. How can I not have any gray hair? Back then, when Austin just started his business, I accompanied him everywhere. I was already in my thirties when I had you. I still remember going to many places with him and always renting houses. Sometimes, when he took on projects, we would even live directly on the construction site to save money. In the year I was pregnant, he made his first fortune. He was very happy and believed that you brought him good luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily smiled kindly and reached out to touch my hair. Even though I had already grown up, in her eyes, I seemed to always be that little baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you and Dad have worked hard for me all these years," I said to Lily, feeling sorry for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily gave everything she had for Austin back then, truly betting her whole life on him. Otherwise, with her family background, she could have lived a carefree life. However, she deliberately chose Austin, who had nothing, and accompanied him for many years under difficult conditions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But fortunately, she eventually won the gamble. Although it was tiring to follow Austin, I knew that Lily had actually been living a happy life all these years, because from beginning to end, Austin only loved her, and there were never any scandals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't feel tired. On the contrary, I felt that the happiness we gained from enduring hardships together was the most solid. I followed him without hesitation back then because I admired his character. When you choose a man, family background and appearance are not important, and character is the most important. In the end, </span><span>marriage is all about conscience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily spoke earnestly. She looked at me with a meaningful gaze, which gave me a strange feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened to Lily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hasn't told me these profound truths for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I was not obedient in the past and desperately wanted to be with Elliott, she used herself as an example and earnestly advised me to choose a man who truly cared for me, instead of tiptoeing to look up to a man, because it would be very difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that time, I simply couldn't listen to her words at all. I was just stubbornly pursuing what I thought was love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that I have awakened, I increasingly realize that her words, seemingly useless, actually contain truths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, are you seeing me about to become a mother soon, so you've started nagging again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw the situation and then fell into her arms, asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It has been a long time since I was so intimate with Lily. She smiled and gently stroked my hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, looking at your growing belly, I am both happy and sad for you. I feel happy that you are going to be a mother soon, but sad that you have gone through so much and ended up alone. I am worried."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what are you saying! How could I be alone? I still have you and my dad. When the baby is born, we will still be a happy family. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know why Lily suddenly became so sentimental, so I quickly smiled and comforted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, but Austin and I are getting old, so it's impossible for us to be with you for a lifetime. Madeline, the biggest wish of my life is that you can have someone who loves and understands you by your side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily still spoke, her tone carrying a hint of heaviness and sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head and looked at her with some confusion. I didn't know if it was because she was getting older, but it seemed like she was worrying and fretting about more things now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I didn't think much about it. After spending a plain weekend at home with Lily and Austin, I returned to work at Glory Group.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="661.html">« Prev</a><a href="663.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
