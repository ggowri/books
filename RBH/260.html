In front of Quinn, I could boldly speak out my innermost ideas.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the dishes were served one by one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening quietly to what I said, Quinn didn't say much and acted as a qualified listener. He drank glass after glass of wine with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drunk and emotional, I poured out my heart a lot.&#8203;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I told Quinn all of my true feelings about Elliott after my rebirth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I confessed, at first, that I harbored animosity towards Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over time, that resentment </span><span>changed </span><span>into attachment and unwillingness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, an unexpected fondness for his kindness came towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I couldn't discern if my feelings for Elliott were rooted in love, possessiveness, revenge, or something else entirely... I was at a loss to define it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I only knew that when I learned of this result and the inevitable end of my marriage with Elliot today, an indescribable sadness overwhelmed me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, actually, you've always loved Elliott."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was so drunk that he had a stutter, but his words were still unmistakably clear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was drunk, too. Looking up at him, I said, "But what can I do if I still like him? He and I are going to split up and never get back together."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, however, laughed and suddenly came closer to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, shall we bet once?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bet on what?" I stared at him in confusion. The alcohol had gradually invaded my brain, and I wasn't completely sober.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn pulled his phone out of his pocket, as if he was going to help me test Elliott's thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied with certainty, "I'll call him now and ask him to come and take you away. If he comes, it proves that he cares about you. If he doesn't, on the other hand, how about you give up on him completely after tonight?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's not coming. Quinn, don't waste your </span><span>time</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head. I didn't have any confidence as to what was actually in Elliott's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if he comes?" Quinn, however, had already dialed Elliott's number.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, he came to my ear and said, "Madeline, don't worry. Even if Elliott breaks your heart entirely, I'm still here in this world to support you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned. However, the dizziness couldn't allow me to speculate anything more about Quinn's </span><span>words</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I witnessed Quinn dialing Elliott's number and heard Elliott's deep and magnetic voice on the other end after the phone rang a few times.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said, "Elliott, Madeline is at my club and drunk. Can you come and get her back?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a moment of silence on the other end of the line, which made me flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a few seconds, Elliott's clear reply came. "Okay, I'll be right over."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won the bet, Madeline. Don't be depressed. Maybe your ending will be different."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hanging up, Quinn was genuinely delighted, like a child. He heavily patted my shoulder and shared some profoundly meaningful words with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I couldn't discern whether it was the lighting, but I noticed his eyes gleaming as if tears were welling up in them.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="259.html">« Prev</a><a href="261.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
