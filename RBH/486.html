I turned my head and saw Lily looking at me with a gentle expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the sound of fireworks came from outside. Through the window, I could see the dazzling fireworks bursting like blooming flowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you're finally awake. You really scared me these past two days!" Lily said happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was still a bit confused and subconsciously rubbed my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, have I been sleeping this long? There are fireworks outside... is it Christmas already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, today is Christmas. You had the flu, but luckily Marcus is a skilled doctor. He gave you some medicine to help bring down your fever," Lily said joyfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "So, I had a fever too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I must have caught a cold from being in close contact with Elliott while taking care of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that I'm pregnant, can I still take those medicines?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic suddenly gripped my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively asked Lily, "Mom, where is Marcus now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's downstairs having a drink with your dad. Today is Christmas. I made a table full of dishes and sandwiches. He didn't charge us for treating you and your dad, and I feel guilty about it. He's spending Christmas alone, so I invited him to celebrate with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily said all this in one breath, then checked my temperature and smiled when she found I was okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I feel much better now. I'm going to get up and go downstairs to join them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I prepared to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing this, Lily hurriedly stopped me and put her arm around my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, Madeline, there's something I need to tell you. I already know you're pregnant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's words startled me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know how to tell them about it, so I was planning to keep it to myself for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Marcus tell you? Mom, I was planning to tell you guys in a little while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt guilty and lowered my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, a few days ago when your fever wouldn't go down, your dad and I were anxious to take you to the hospital. But Marcus persuaded us not to, saying there were too many patients in the hospital, and taking you there might worsen your condition. Although we insisted, Marcus eventually told us about your pregnancy and promised to find a way to help bring down your fever with medicine, as it would have the least side effects on your body and be best for the baby in your belly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh. Mom, you can trust Marcus. He won't do anything he's not sure of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having gotten to know Marcus during this time, I had absolute confidence in his moral character.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he personally prepared the medication. You took it only twice, and your fever went down. To prevent us from getting infected, he made your dad and me take the medicine too. I have to say, this medicine is really powerful. I heard the hospital has been overcrowded recently, with many people having a fever for several days in a row. The news has been reporting this. Experts say it's a new virus spreading rapidly outside. It seems this year is not very peaceful..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily filled me in on what had happened in the past two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't surprised, as I had already anticipated this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, saying, "For your safety, mom, don't go out with dad for a while. Buy more essential items for the home, especially during this special time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked at me seriously, asking, "I know, before Christmas, your dad and I went to the supermarket many times and bought a lot of things. Madeline, getting back to the point, what are your plans for this child?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="485.html">« Prev</a><a href="487.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
