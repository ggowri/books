These past two years, I've only wanted to focus on my career, and help Austin more, why rush to have a baby? I'm still so young, I can wait a couple more years to have one," I reiterated my thoughts, taking a few white hibiscus flowers from Lily's hand and rinsing them under the faucet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I recognize this flower because when I was a child, Lily often stir-fried this kind of flower with eggs. It was a light and delicious dish that I loved to eat since I was young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are slowly getting along well now. Have another child, and your marital relationship will be stable. I am still young and can help you take care of the child. Even if you want to focus on your career, it's okay. After the child is born, you can leave them to me and continue to help Austin. It won't be a problem, right? You, this child, are sometimes so stubborn," Lily scolded me with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I certainly understood her thoughts. For parents, of course, they hope that we can form a happy little family, and in their eyes, a family without children is always incomplete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know it very well myself, Lily. You don't need to persuade me anymore. Besides, if I keep hearing these words, I might just end up permanently staying in Louis City and not coming back," I said, deliberately trying to silence Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing me say this, Lily had no choice but to give up. She shook her head helplessly and said, "Alright, alright, I won't say anything. So, from now on, focus on learning a few more dishes with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." I quickly said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I accompanied Lily in the kitchen, bustling around busily. Meanwhile, Elliott was in the yard playing chess with Austin. In the midst of my busy moments in the kitchen, I could still catch a glimpse of them through the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sunlight fell calmly and gently, it was already deep autumn. A gust of wind blew, and the tall trees in the yard rustled, dropping a carpet of fallen leaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, as if he knew I was watching him, suddenly turned his head and gave me a bright smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily averted my gaze, but my face inexplicably flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything seemed like a dream, so unreal that it made me feel dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, when I was deeply in love with Elliott, our lives had never experienced such beauty. However, now, as I have made up my mind to distance myself from him and let go of him, he suddenly becomes capable of doing this for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what he was thinking, or how he defined the relationship between him and me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he do this to cherish the rhythm of our marriage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no idea at all, and I didn't dare to think too much about it, because I was afraid that the answer in his heart would break my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily and I quickly prepared a table full of dishes, and after Austin and Elliott finished playing chess, they went to wash their hands and then sat down around the dining table as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I, Lily, pointed at some of the dishes and smiled at Elliott, saying, "Elliott, these dishes were all made by Madeline. Give them a try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, this dish looks very unique, is this... flowers?" With just one glance, Elliott noticed the plate of hibiscus flower scrambled eggs and he was surprised. He extended his fork and picked up a flower, putting it in his mouth, and immediately praised it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What dish is this? It looks like a flower, but it tastes very tender and refreshing, with a hint of fragrance," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a hibiscus flower, the one planted in our yard. Madeline has loved eating this dish since she was little, so every year when the flowers bloom, I would pick some for her to stir-fry with eggs. Elliott, it seems like you also enjoy eating it?" Lily said.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="181.html">« Prev</a><a href="183.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
