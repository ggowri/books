He's conscious! That machine just beeped! The doctor said if that machine beeps, it means Mr. Bryant's brain is responding to the outside world! Mrs. Bryant, Mr. Bryant must have heard what you said to him! I'm going to fetch the doctor, just hold on!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was as excited as a kid, he immediately spun around and dashed out, hollering for the doctor to come over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing him say that, I turned incredulously to look at Elliott on the hospital bed. I rushed forward and barely grasped his hand when I felt his fingers twitch slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movements were so slight, almost imperceptible. But I was absolutely certain, it wasn't me jostling him, he was truly moving on his own!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, it seems like he's really coming to. His finger just moved, it really moved!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of emotion, from an unknown source, ambushed my heart in an instant. In that moment, I couldn't help but let out a loud, impassioned cry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor, trailed by a nurse, dashed into the patient's room. After a swift examination of Elliott, a hint of a smile broke through his stern facade:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, your method is indeed working. Mr. Bryant's brain just showed a response. As long as there's a response, that's good. Let this lady keep him company, I believe he'll wake up soon."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, this doctor had no idea who I was. But that was to be expected, considering it's been a while since Elliott and I divorced.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, I understand this might be a tall order for you, but... would you be willing to come every day?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry glanced at me awkwardly, a hint of timidity lacing his tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing him address me in such a manner, a look of surprise washed over the doctor's face:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"May I ask, who might this be?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's Mr. Bryan's..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ex-wife."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Barry was about to introduce who I was, I cut him off. I bluntly told the doctor about my relationship with Elliott, leaving him utterly taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, drop the Mrs. Bryant. If calling me Ms. Mayers feels odd, just go with Madeline. I'm here because of Elliott's condition. If my visits can help him, I'll come every day. However, I'd prefer if the Bryant family were kept in the dark about this. I don't need any more trouble. You can handle that, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, I immediately agreed to Barry's request.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take care of it, Made... Madeline. It's getting late, let me take you home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my words, Barry instantly perked up. Then, with utmost respect, he escorted me out of the hospital room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood at the doorway, casting a deep glance at Elliott in the hospital room, a sense of heaviness inexplicably settling in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought there would be no further contact between Elliott and me. After all, we had said all there was to say.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, to wake him up, I have no choice but to do this. Otherwise, my conscience will be plagued with guilt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a whirlwind of emotions, I stepped out of Bryant Hospital, and lo and behold, I ran into that woman again...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="764.html">« Prev</a><a href="766.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
