Do you know what you are actually doing right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gritted my teeth and yelled at her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Rationality? Since the moment my daughter jumped into the sea, I had no intention of continuing to live! However, I also need someone to die with me! Why should my daughter end up like this while you get whatever you want? Let me tell you, Madeline, as long as I'm here, you will never set foot in the Bryant family again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole squeezed the door while shouting at me hoarsely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, she mistakenly thought that I came to attend the Bryant family's funeral, wanting to start over with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You misunderstood. I simply came today to accompany Mr. Jasper Bryant on his final journey. There will be no possibility between Elliott and me anymore. Nicole, please be rational. Can we communicate properly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I watched her about to squeeze in, I was already exhausted. Additionally, continuously forcefully blocking the door made me clearly feel my stomach tighten, as if triggering contractions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona had repeatedly told me to pay attention to contractions during the late stage of pregnancy. If I were to start experiencing contractions early, it would be very detrimental to the fetus. However, now I can clearly feel that something is not right with my stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to stabilize her emotions, I had to try to persuade her patiently. However, Nicole was already on the verge of madness at this point and simply couldn't listen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is nothing for me to communicate with you. All I know is that whatever my daughter cannot have, you can forget about having it too! Today, you have fallen into my hands, and that's your luck! You think you can happily marry into a wealthy family while carrying a child? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Nicole finished shouting, she suddenly exerted all her strength and crashed into the door of the compartment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I watched her fiercely rush in, I was startled and quickly stepped back. However, the space in the compartment was very narrow, and I had nowhere to retreat. In an instant, I was squeezed into the corner of the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed over and immediately grabbed my hair, forcing me to bend down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, this crazy woman actually tried to use her knees to hit my stomach!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was already so panicked that I didn't know what to do, so I desperately used my hands and feet to protect my stomach, and started playing a fierce game with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you inside? Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Quinn's shout came from outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard a sound and realized that the rescuers were coming. I quickly shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was just about to make a sound, but to my surprise, Nicole suddenly pulled out a piece of cloth from her pocket and forcefully stuffed it into my mouth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God knows what that rag of hers had wiped. The nauseating smell made my stomach churn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately tried to pull off that piece of cloth, however, she once again charged straight toward my stomach like a wild bull!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um... um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I desperately tried to vomit out the piece of cloth, but it was in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she was about to crash into my belly, I had no choice but to quickly use both hands to protect it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, the door of the compartment was suddenly opened. Immediately, I saw someone holding up a pointed heel of a high-heeled shoe, without any hesitation, and smashed it directly toward Nicole's forehead!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="670.html">« Prev</a><a href="672.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
