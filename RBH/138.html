Upon hearing this, the two shareholders immediately shut their mouths in disappointment and did not express any further opinions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she had no charisma at all. Even if she had excellent acting skills, what's the use if she didn't have any fans supporting her? We can't possibly spend a fortune on promotion in the later stages, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was already at a disadvantage at this time, but she still argued defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a video that was recently posted on the website, and it has already reached a billion views. It is a free public service announcement film shot by Audrey not long ago... Although this promotional film is short, it has gained a billion views in a short period of time. Moreover, it is still soaring in popularity. I have high hopes for this girl, I think she has great potential and it's worth taking a risk on her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a seasoned director in the industry, Frank presented solid evidence to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree. Instead of using those third-rate actors, why not give newcomers a try? Perhaps miracles can happen. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Austin had already understood everything. He knew that once I set my mind to something, I would see it through to the end, just like how I commit to loving someone for a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank had already said so, and the two shareholders couldn't say anything for a moment. So, they nodded and tacitly agreed to my decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade wanted to say something else. Seeing that she was about to speak, I didn't want to give her any chance to talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's settled then. Our schedule is quite tight, so I would like to present this play as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, Austin..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade still wanted to say something, but I interrupted her directly, "Jade, I have already made up my mind about this matter, so you don't need to say anything more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of the two shareholders, I had to make it clear to them who the real heiress of the Mayers family is and who Austin truly supports.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade showed her anger directly. She clenched her fists, and the hostility on her face looked terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I just coldly glanced at her and turned around, walking out of Austin's office door with Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, we determined the time to go to Louis City Film and Television Base for shooting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, I disregarded my leg injury and went directly to Louis City with Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once people get busy with work, time really flies. A week passes in the blink of an eye, and during this week, it's as if I completely forgot about Elliott, not a single moment did I think of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not until Adam drove past the Bryant Group building and looked at the towering office building that I suddenly remembered that I was still Elliott's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, I realized that my so-called husband had not contacted me for a whole week.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since that night when I chose to get into Quinn's car, it was as if he disappeared from my world. He never inquired about anything concerning me, and I never even thought about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the time when I loved him for so many years, this was the first time I discovered that I could actually momentarily forget about him...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="137.html">« Prev</a><a href="139.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
