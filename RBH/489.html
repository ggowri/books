I said it before. I will be your knight. No matter what happens, you just have to ask, and I will help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two kept talking, and it felt like they were competing and showing off to each other. It made me chuckle uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, the host of the television show was broadcasting the program.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We all put down our glasses and ran out into the yard together. Marcus and Quinn took down many fireworks from the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They placed the fireworks in the yard. As the clock struck midnight, we lit the fireworks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, we watched the fireworks soar and light up the night beautifully. At that moment, I couldn't help but put my hands together, looked at the sky, and made a wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wished my baby to be born safely and hoped that my parents could enjoy their old age healthily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the weather was freezing, our hearts were warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, snowflakes suddenly fell from the sky. When the crystal-clear snowflakes fell on my hands and face, I couldn't help but exclaim in awe, "Woah, it's snowing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, what a good timing. Some people say that snow will bring good luck. It seems that next year, our luck will be great!" Marcus said happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to the weather forecast, the snow is expected to be very heavy. The temperature will continue to drop in the next few years. So, you all must remember to keep warm. A lot of people catch a cold and fever recently," Quinn interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin stood at the door and said, "The fireworks are over. Let's go inside. Madeline just recovered from a cold, and we should not let her be exposed to the cold wind for too long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of us quickly returned indoors. At this point, Lily was a little tired, while Austin started to doze off on the sofa after drinking a fair amount of wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily asked him to sleep first, but he was reluctant to leave such a happy environment, so he just lay on the sofa and rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn suggested we play poker cards together. Then, he performed magic, pulling a deck of cards from his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Quinn, Marcus, and I started the game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While playing cards and happily chatting with everyone, I suddenly realized that it had been a long time since I had experienced such a relaxed and happy moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had been alone at Serenity Villa on Christmas Eve for the past few years, impatiently waiting for Elliott to return home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I now felt that this was the proper way to spend Christmas, especially in contrast to those lonesome and lonely years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My phone couldn't stop ringing. I received a lot of well-wishes after the clock struck midnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam sent me a Christmas greeting, wishing me to stay young forever. Meanwhile, Fiona and Paige kept posting photos of their Christmas dinner and blessings in our group chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the photo, I saw that Paige went to Philip's house for a Christmas party. They were having dinner together joyfully, and the atmosphere looked warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Fiona went to Tepit alone. She was wearing local clothes and sitting at one of her Tepit friends' homes. She looked happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but smile when I looked at the photo. Instinctively, I opened my Instagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, the first story feed was from Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shared a picture of her family getting together to celebrate Christmas at Buttonwood Mansion. Her pregnant belly was prominently displayed as she sat beside Cormac, with the others congregating around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought Elliott wouldn't be in the photo, but suddenly, I noticed he was standing behind Cormac with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I felt a steel nail stabbed my heart. It was so much pain that I covered my chest with my hand. My hands were shaking, and the cards in my hand fell to the ground.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="488.html">« Prev</a><a href="490.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
