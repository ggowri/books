I spotted the intruder lurking not far behind Elliott with a weapon in hand. The intruder held the weapon up and approached Elliott slowly but my sudden shout startled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing he was caught, the intruder swiftly darted out of my yard, disappearing into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was visibly startled by my shout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could comprehend what happened, the intruder had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, my body was drenched in sweat despite the winter chill, and my mind was blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afraid that the intruder might return or that he had other accomplices lurking around, I quickly pulled Elliott inside and slammed the door shut before gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my distressed state, Elliott's eyes widened with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder, his deep brown eyes reflecting worry and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you okay? What just happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I struggled to steady my breathing as I clutched my chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me soaked in sweat, Elliott quickly poured me a glass of warm water and guided me to the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sipping the warm water, I gradually regained composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The living room window had a hole from the break-in, letting in the cold wind. Elliott felt the cold wind and glanced outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he saw the obvious damage, realization dawned on him. He stood up from the sofa and raised his voice in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did that person do this? Who was it? What did they want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the water, my shaken emotions began to calm down. Trembling, I shook my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know. He kept ringing the doorbell, then started smashing the window when I didn't get the door. If you hadn't come in time, I might have... Right, why did you come over in the middle of the night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I spoke, I realized something and asked Elliott about his unexpected arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott squatted down again, noticing my pallor. His eyes filled with tenderness as he gently cupped my face, his thumb tracing over my lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's quite a coincidence, really. Last night, I dreamt of you falling into a deep well. You were unable to climb out and screaming for help. It jolted me awake, and I couldn't shake off the worry, so I decided to come and check on you. I never imagined you were actually in danger..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What? Was it really that much of a coincidence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's revelation made me feel bewildered. I glanced at the ominous black hole, my heart dropping once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The surveillance camera didn't capture his face, but my gut tells me he was a man. I don't know what he wanted, but it's clear he was after me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="407.html">« Prev</a><a href="409.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
