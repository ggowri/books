But just as I began applying my makeup, I turned around and saw Giselle's ghostly figure standing behind me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was grim, casting an eerie shadow in the dimly lit room. For a moment, I felt like I was seeing a ghost in broad daylight, and it sent a chill down my spine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, your pride won't last for long," Giselle said, her tone dripping with malice as she dropped the facade of civility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfazed by her threats, I responded, "And what makes you say that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was accustomed to Giselle's veiled threats. After all, I knew her intentions all too well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing. I just hope you'll still be laughing tonight," she retorted, her eyes betraying a hint of jealousy as she scanned me up and down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why wouldn't I? Are you planning some sort of spectacle for me tonight?" I quipped, masking my unease with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. What happened earlier was just the beginning. You must join us tonight at the Bryant Villa," Giselle said, her tone implying that she already considered herself the hostess of the event.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I go? What does the Bryant Villa have to do with you?" I asked, my voice tinged with coldness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's innocent demeanor belied a sinister smile as she replied, "Perhaps Elliott forgot to mention that I've been living at the Bryant Villa. I'll be sure to give you a warm welcome tonight, Mrs. Bryant."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart sank at her words, but I maintained my composure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott has never mentioned you. Clearly, you're not worthy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I retorted before brushing past her, refusing to engage further.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My indifference made her angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sharp retort followed me as I walked away. "Is that so? I wouldn't be so sure, Madeline. Just wait..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sounded so assured.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At a certain level, I understood her confidence. She was younger. Elliott's mother and grandfather like her more than me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her confidence, I couldn't help but wonder what she had in store for me at the Bryant Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I left the room, and didn't bother to keep on arguing with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though I didn't look back, I could feel her gaze piercing into my back like daggers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, Giselle seemed more frustrated than ever before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was her problem in this life, not mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, whatever drama Giselle had planned for me, I was prepared to face it head-on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, I was no longer the naive girl who allowed herself to be manipulated in my past life.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="360.html">« Prev</a><a href="362.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
