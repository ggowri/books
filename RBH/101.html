She wished that I would break up with Elliott sooner, as she always believed that Elliott was not the right person for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's coming soon, he and I will break up sooner or later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and then said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you say if it was possible for him to gradually discover your goodness? It seems like he has changed his attitude towards you a lot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige held onto my arm and then muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly began to realize my goodness...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From today, he observed my expression throughout the entire time and showed approval after seeing the on-site arrangement at Bryant Group upon returning. Perhaps, maybe, probably, he is slowly realizing my goodness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it is hard to say at the moment what the future holds for him and me, and whether he will ultimately end up with Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were in the past, he would be able to treat me like he does now, and I would be very satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would rather bury my head in the sand like an ostrich, pretending to shield myself from everything outside, as long as he stays by my side and shows me a little more tenderness, I would willingly surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I am becoming more and more unwilling to be an ostrich. I increasingly want to be a soaring wild goose, striving to find a man who truly wants to fly with me and only has me in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I know, Elliott, he was never that kind of person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These things don't matter anymore. When the right time comes, I will break up with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said in a deep voice, with a firm and confident tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige paused for a moment, then she patted my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm afraid that if he starts being nice to you again, you will fall into his gentle trap, just like before. No matter what we say, you won't listen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was indeed too obsessed and crazy about him in the past, so even my best friend didn't believe that I could break free from his charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was not possible now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head and reaffirmed my determination to leave Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing this, Paige decided not to say anything more. She simply said one sentence:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, no matter what decision you ultimately made, I supported it, as long as you were happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head and looked at Paige, thinking about how she had cared for me in my last moment of life in the previous life, and instantly my eyes welled up with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know that I was thinking so much, and she thought I suddenly became sentimental, which startled her and made her quickly fetch a tissue to wipe away my tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Oh my, what's wrong with you? Geez, I've never seen you so easily moved before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, in the past, I didn't really understand emotions. I took for granted all the people who were good to me. But often, it's only when you reach a dead end that you realize how precious those who have always been good to you truly are.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but burst into tears of laughter, looking at her, for a moment I didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you were here all along. I've been looking for you for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's deep voice came from the entrance of the caf&eacute; at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly composed myself and stood up to ask,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Do you need something from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The morning went smoothly, and now they have been arranged to have lunch and take a short break. Thank you for your hard work today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was surprisingly looking forward to seeing me. As soon as he saw me, he immediately walked up to me and, in front of Giselle, without hesitation, he grabbed my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sparkle in his eyes was extremely sincere, and I could feel it. Today, he genuinely approved of my performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not hard, as long as you are satisfied. And then, just don't treat my friend unfairly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said with a smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="100.html">« Prev</a><a href="102.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
