As long as he avoids emotional triggers and continues the treatment for about three months, the blood clot should gradually dissolve, and his memory will slowly return to normal. However, if he continues to be emotionally triggered like this, causing further damage, then the situation becomes unpredictable."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Dr. Muller, you're saying that with the current treatment plan, we're looking at about three months?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if I had suddenly glimpsed hope, my previously deflated spirits instantly soaring once again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed. But the catch is, we can't let him experience any more emotional upheavals. Judging from his current state, he's handling his work quite well. It's just that when it comes to his feelings for you, his emotions seem to be easily affected. So, I'd ask you to be a bit more patient."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I got it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After conversing with Dr. Muller, I stepped out of his office to find Laura Bryant waiting for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing me emerge, she immediately dashed over. Swiftly scanning the surroundings, she then pulled me aside, whispering in an almost inaudible voice:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, spill it. What's the deal with that kid?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura looked like a cat that had just spotted a fish, her eyes filled with desire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "This is bad!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had hoped to keep the birth of my child as low-key as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who would have thought, just stepping out for a meal, and I accidentally bumped into Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always suspected that the child belonged to the Bryant family. Now, seeing my parents with the kid, knowing her nature, she would definitely try to figure it out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's mine and Quinn's kid, has nothing to do with the Bryant family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're lying!" Laura glared at me, "If it's a child of the Woods family, how could they possibly let your parents take the child? Madeline, I know I was wrong in the past, but now that you and Elliott are back together, as long as you don't dwell on the past, I promise to treat you and the child well. Tell me, is it a boy or a girl?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean 'we're together'? You should know better than anyone, I'm only playing along because he lost his memory."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether it's all an act or not, it doesn't matter. The point is, you two are together again. You know, Elliott has always loved you. Now that you have a child, it doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl. As long as you and Elliott have a child, I can rest easy. Madeline, could I possibly meet the child?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura looked at me with pleading eyes, as if she had already concluded that the child was Elliott's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but the kid has no ties with your family. Dr. Muller just informed me that your son's condition should significantly improve in about three months. However, if you keep pestering me about this child during these three months, it might stress me out and potentially worsen your son's condition. You wouldn't want that, would you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, I made a beeline for the direction of the hospital room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Elliott's current situation, Laura is aware of the significant influence I have on him, hence, she refrained from saying more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I returned to the sickbay.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hospital room, Barry was awake, sitting by Elliott's side. Elliott, with an IV drip in his arm, had already regained consciousness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing me, a natural glimmer of joy sparkled in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you've arrived."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How's it going? Feeling any better? Is your head still hurting?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I noticed Elliott's lips were still pale, so I walked over and asked softly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm feeling much better now. Thanks for your help, Madeline! Barry told me I passed out, but I can't seem to remember why. What on earth happened?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott asked me, a touch of confusion in his voice.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="845.html">« Prev</a><a href="847.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
