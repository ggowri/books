I didn't feel moved at all. I could feel Paige's feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The three of us?" Paige couldn't help but sneer, "Unfortunately, such a scene will never exist in my life. Philip, you should congratulate yourself. You have successfully destroyed all my hopes for love, marriage, and children. Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Paige said this, her tears once again uncontrollably welled up in her eyes. She turned her head quickly to wipe away the tears, not wanting Philip to see her vulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, don't say it like this. Don't cry. I know I was wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip also cried as he looked at Paige. He couldn't even speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the scene, Quinn gestured for me to go out with him. I nodded and walked out of the ward with Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We walked to a corner of the corridor. Quinn looked at me and let out a heavy sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked me, "Paige lost her child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The doctors wanted to save the child, but Paige gave up. She had already decided to break up with Philip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? The child is about to be born. How could she be so heartless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was very surprised and couldn't help but raise his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and said slowly, "She was betrayed. This child will only bring her pain. She cannot tolerate any mistakes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what I said, Quinn sighed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a pity! An innocent life was gone. I talked to Philip about it. He said he cared a lot about Paige and the child, but couldn't resist the temptation..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I interrupted Quinn and said coldly, "Quinn, stop. This is just an excuse for men, isn't it? If a man truly loves a woman, he wouldn't allow any flaws in their relationship. If they really love each other, how could someone else come between them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I couldn't help but think of the baby inside my belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and Giselle's child had been born. Moreover, he was in the neonatal ward of this hospital. When I thought about this, my heart ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby in my belly seemed to sense my sadness, and suddenly moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn knew that I associated it with myself, and he comfortingly patted my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't be sad. No matter how difficult the road ahead may be, I will be with </span><span>you. Don't be afraid. Go ahead bravely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up at Quinn and smiled gratefully. At that moment, I suddenly heard familiar footsteps coming from the other end of the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively looked over and saw Elliott in a black suit. He walked towards us solemnly...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="608.html">« Prev</a><a href="610.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
