He seldom spoke, leaving others to guess his intentions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he's openly flaunting his love for me, even going so far as to wear matching couple outfits identical to mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, their mouths hung open in surprise, and I could feel my cheeks flush with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, who dares to steal your lady? Mr. Bryant, you must be joking."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Mr. Bryant, who would've thought you loved your wife so much."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, Mr. Bryant, how about you and your wife team up? That way, you won't have to worry about us stealing her away..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's joking around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, by the way, I can take a moment to appreciate my lady's skills in the game."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't refuse. He walked straight towards me in public, casually slinging his arm over my shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was mortified, yet I didn't have the heart to reject him in front of the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, everyone swiftly reorganized the teams. Elliott and I ended up in the same group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed as if everyone was intentionally creating an opportunity for us to be alone. They took a few casual swings and hurried off to the next location, leaving just the two of us behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's rare to see Elliott out of his suit and in casual wear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decked out in this white tracksuit, Elliott not only looked taller, but also fairer. The usually brooding him seemed more vibrant, leaving me somewhat dazed. Suddenly, I was reminded of the memory of him in his school uniform, riding his bicycle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give it a shot, I've yet to see you play ball."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catching my gaze, Elliott flashed a casual smile. He reached out, taking my hand, urging me to give it a try.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've never seen you play before, this is the first time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, there's a lot we haven't been through together. But from now on, I don't want any more regrets between us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott spoke slowly, his voice tinged with regret.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took my stance, gripping the club, eyeing the white ball. My hand began to swing in a steady rhythm, my heart pounding in my chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't initially feel any pressure, but the way Elliott kept staring at me non-stop, it inexplicably made me a bit nervous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, I took a swing. Embarrassingly, I didn't even hit the ball. In stark contrast, Elliott had just sunk the ball in one shot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shot Elliott an awkward glance, hastily explaining:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is definitely not my usual standard. Let me give it another shot, just watch."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott burst into laughter:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your swing just now wasn't quite up to par. Let me show you how it's done."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood directly behind me, his hands reaching around to grasp my left and right hand respectively. Then, he used his body to guide mine, swaying together in unison.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he was teaching and whispering some pointers and key notes to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath fanned against my earlobe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was a raspy yet gentle whisper, his hands seemingly magical. Under his guidance, I quickly found my rhythm, swinging out with a forceful stroke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stick is absolutely fantastic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ball effortlessly rolled into the hole, and immediately, Elliott broke into applause:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely fantastic! You've got a real knack for this!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I flashed a smile, then gestured for him to step back. I adjusted my stance, found the right angle, and then, I took a swing all by myself.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="887.html">« Prev</a><a href="889.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
