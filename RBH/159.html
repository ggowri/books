But when I lifted my hand, I realized that it was tightly held by someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I moved, the other person's hand moved immediately. Then, I heard a very familiar deep voice: "You finally woke up. Does your head still hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked over as I heard the sound and saw Elliott sitting next to the hospital bed, wearing a white shirt, his hand still holding mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time I noticed, his usually neat hair was somewhat disheveled, and his handsome face looked a bit tired. Not only did he have a small stubble around his mouth, but his eyes were also bloodshot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me with an extremely worried expression, which shocked and surprised me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did I end up here?" I suddenly remembered what had happened and instinctively tried to sit up, asking, "How is the venue? Is it still raining?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still remembered that incident at the scene, after all, it was the most important thing before I fell into a coma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott hurriedly pressed my shoulder, preventing me from sitting up, and quickly said, "Everything over there has been taken care of, and the problematic areas are currently being urgently rebuilt. You're injured, the doctor said you have a mild concussion and need to lie down and rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott rarely spoke so much at once, and moreover, his tone was extremely gentle, which made me feel somewhat incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I responded with a thoughtful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that he already knew about this matter, so presumably, he must also know that I have recovered the losses for him, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He is sitting here now, treating me so gently instead of Giselle. It seems that the attention Giselle used to receive has been completely taken over by me, and I have become the protagonist instead of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a slight sense of joy in my heart, and at that moment, Elliott suddenly reached out and affectionately touched my face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Aren't you in Louis City? How did you manage to get to the venue?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I certainly would not give up the opportunity to show myself in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I encountered heavy rain on my way back to Hoswich and suddenly remembered that you had mentioned organizing an exhibition recently. Seeing the rain pouring down like this, I was worried if there would be any issues at the venue, so I went to take a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I explained the reason, and then I deliberately added, "And didn't you say you wanted to try to start over with me? I thought, since we're starting over, your matters are also my matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished speaking, I deliberately lowered my head, pretending to be shy and not daring to look at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, I was waiting for his reaction to hear my words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found that my acting in front of him now has become more and more proficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott indeed tightened his grip on my hand, and he reached over to lift my chin, making me look into his eyes. I could clearly see that his deep eyes, which used to be cold, were now filled with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "I really didn't expect you to do this, you really put in a lot of effort. The project team has reported everything to me. Madeline, tell me, what reward do you want?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="158.html">« Prev</a><a href="160.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
