They stopped and turned to look at me, trying to look decent. However, through their eyes, I could sense that they were feeling embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my previous life, my relationship with my in-laws gradually deteriorated after Giselle appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, my in-laws were good to me. Although they were not particularly satisfied with me, they didn't hate me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But later on, I became increasingly anxious about Elliott's attitude towards Giselle, so I did many extreme actions to win back his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, my in-laws were strongly dissatisfied with me for not getting pregnant for a long time. At the same time, Giselle's obedience and cheerful personality gradually gained appreciation from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Giselle gradually gained favor from Elliott. She accompanied Elliott in several major business deals, which made my in-laws like her more. They increasingly saw Giselle as the most suitable candidate to be Elliott's wife. As a result, their attitude towards me gradually turned to disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, I would no longer be as willful and self-centered as I was in my previous life. I should never only focus on Elliott and ignore everyone around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked towards Laura and Jasper, smiling. At the same time, I took the initiative to reach out and hold Laura's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said with a smile, "Laura, I didn't even know you were here. If I had known, I would have come back earlier. You must not have eaten dinner yet, right? I'll go make a late-night snack for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...?" Laura was surprised by my sudden enthusiastic attitude. She looked at me skeptically. "I heard from Sean that you can't even cook pasta. What kind of late-night snack can you make for us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was outspoken and never beat around the bush. Sometimes, her words were quite harsh. In my previous life, I often argued with her, which made her even more dissatisfied with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Laura was not a malicious person and never had the intention to harm me. Later, Elliott insisted on divorcing me. At first, Laura strongly opposed it. Unfortunately, I didn't know how to win people over at that time, so Giselle won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, recently I learned several dishes from my mom. Let me cook for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and rushed to the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened the refrigerator and found a variety of ingredients. It reminded me that Laura and Jasper loved to eat seafood. Coincidentally, I had recently learned the recipe for seafood soup from my mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took out the shrimp and crab roe from the refrigerator, crushed them, added various seasonings, and stirred them evenly. Then, I cooked a pot of soup like my mother did and put the seafood into it. Finally, I sprinkled some seasoning. Soon, a delicious seafood soup was ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of my mom's secret recipe, as someone who rarely cooked, I surprisingly made a decent seafood soup on the first try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried a bite myself and found that the taste, although slightly inferior to what my mother made, was still delicious and not greasy at all. It was just right to have it as a late-night snack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After marrying Elliott for so long, this was the first time I voluntarily cooked a meal for my parents-in-law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like I expected, they didn't have dinner yet. By the time I brought out the seafood soup from the kitchen, they were already sitting at the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and placed two bowls of seafood soup in front of them. The unique aroma of the soup made Jasper's serious expression slightly soften.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cleared his throat and asked in a serious tone, "Did you make this yourself or did you buy it? I won't eat it if you bought it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, I made it myself using fresh ingredients. Please try it first, and if you like it, there's more in the pot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper frowned slightly, trying to show his dissatisfaction, but his actions had betrayed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper immediately picked up a spoon and tasted the soup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His serious expression eased. Soon, he drank more soup without saying anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper had always been very picky about food, and many delicious dishes did not meet his standards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was exactly like him on this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was surprised that Jasper enjoyed the late-night snack I made. She was suspicious and tasted it herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was not as calm as Jasper. After she tasted it, she nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is quite delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's affirmation relieved me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and said, "If you like it, I would ask my mom to teach me more dishes. Then I could cook for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I completely looked down upon cooking and never thought about learning it. I always ignored what my mother said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Giselle won the hearts of Elliott and his parents with her cooking skills. I was at a loss, as her competence made me appear like a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that cooking was not difficult to learn. As long as one was willing to put in the effort, anyone could do it well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing special about Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The approval of my parents-in-law gave me more confidence in myself. Although Giselle had not appeared, in my heart, I was ready for this invisible war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right." Laura was delighted to hear me say that. "If a woman wants to capture a man's heart, she has to please his stomach. Since you have this intention, I believe Elliott will like you at last. Men, when they are young, are all flirtatious. There is no need to pay attention to his mistress. When Jasper first got married, it was the same for him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pretended to cough, "Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura started exposing Jasper's shortcomings, which startled him. Jasper quickly interrupted, almost choking on a mouthful of soup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura glared at Jasper with displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said disapprovingly, "That's the truth, Jasper, Elliott is just like the younger version of you. You were flirtatious and never stayed at home. If it wasn't for me giving birth to Elliott back then, some other woman might have seduced you away. So, Madeline, the most important thing at this stage is to have children."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was outspoken and didn't care about whether Jasper would feel embarrassed or not. She used her own experience to tell me the importance of having children early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I almost blurted out that I no longer wanted children, but tonight the atmosphere was unusually good, and I couldn't bear to ruin it. So I pretended to agree. I nodded and promised to try my best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing a satisfying meal of seafood soup, they stood up and planned to return to the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Jasper left, Laura suddenly whispered in my ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, sometimes men can be despicable. When they go out, they hope you are dignified and proper. But behind closed doors, they want you to be as naughty as possible. Make sure you know what to do when you're with Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never dreamed that my picky mother-in-law would secretly say this to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, I was still a virgin. I blushed at her words and suddenly didn't know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura smiled and patted my hand. Then she went back to the room with Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was dawdling downstairs alone until midnight. Figuring that Elliott had fallen asleep, I went upstairs and entered the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was very quiet. I was afraid of disturbing him, so I didn't turn on the light. I climbed onto the bed in the dark and lay down in one corner of the bed, keeping some distance from Elliott as much as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought Elliott had gone to sleep, but I didn't expect that just as I lay down, Elliott suddenly made a sound...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="11.html">« Prev</a><a href="13.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
