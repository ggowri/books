Hastily setting aside his phone, I quickly explained, "Barry called just now. He couldn't find you and was worried. Are you feeling any better? Marcus is preparing medicine for you. Let's see if it helps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott opened his eyes and felt the burning pain from the fever in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked in a hoarse voice, "Where am I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're at Marcus' place," I replied promptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling to turn his head, he surveyed his surroundings with a hint of dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you bring me here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "I can't tell him that he has a highly contagious viral flu, so I can't take him to my place, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard the sound from the kitchen and saw Marcus coming out with a bowl of medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, I said to Elliott, "Marcus has effective cold medicine here. You're awake now, and he's ready with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott struggled to sit up from the couch, but his body was too weak to do so. Seeing this, I moved over and used my arms to prop him up, letting him lean against me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus brought a bowl of herbal soup in front of us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, you're awake just in time. This medicine is for you. Drink it while it's hot. Once you sweat, your fever will break."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eyeing the dark concoction, Elliott instinctively frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grumbled in his hoarse voice, "I never drink this stuff."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I recalled Elliott's aversion to herbal remedies. Every time Laura arranged tonics for his health, he never even glanced at them, instructing Sean to dispose of them directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been in the hospital for days with no improvement in your fever. This is our last resort. Be cooperative and drink it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I urged, spooning a dose towards his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I had been fearful of him, speaking to him in a gentle tone. Now, perhaps due to a lack of love, my tone had turned authoritative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After my outburst, Elliott's body visibly trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the spoon at his lips, he reluctantly opened his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the moment, I poured a spoonful of the bitter medicine into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forced to swallow, Elliott grimaced, muttering, "Bitter..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitter medicine cures illness. More!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't mince words, offering another spoonful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Elliott opened his mouth again. Despite the bitterness, he obediently swallowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching him grimace in pain while swallowing, I couldn't help but feel a sense of vindictive pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Who told you to be so arrogant before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I won't be as kind to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each spoonful, I poured the medicine down his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ill in bed, Elliott had transformed from a tiger to a sickly cat. His former dignity and aura were completely absent as he slumped in my arms, resembling a child in dire need of support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing me feed him the entire bowl of medicine, Marcus smirked but refrained from commenting.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="479.html">« Prev</a><a href="481.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
