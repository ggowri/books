Why would he suddenly want to commit suicide?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, how could you have such thoughts in your previous life? Why? What made you feel so desperate?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I have no worries?" Quinn sighed helplessly and chuckled lightly. "I also have many unavoidable hardships and an inescapable fate. But don't worry, in this lifetime, for you, I will never easily give up my own life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unavoidable fate? What do you mean?" I furrowed my brow, feeling increasingly perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, however, did not want to answer the question anymore and avoided my gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will know later. Well, now the mystery is solved, Madeline, do you still have any concerns?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation circled back to its initial point again, and his question left me speechless for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I..." This was too sudden for me, and I was at a loss for how to respond to his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know it's sudden to tell you all this and you need time to take it in. It's okay, as long as you don't reject me, I'll give you time to think it through. Now my family has also accepted everything, and there are no obstacles between us. You just need to know that I have always been standing not far behind you, and if you decide to turn around, I will definitely be the first to hold your hand and accompany you through the rest of our lives," Quinn said sincerely to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one has ever been so good to me without complaints or regrets, except for my parents, and Quinn in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What woman wouldn't feel touched by such love and dedication?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Love, it's not just about being moved. If I accepted Quinn out of a momentary feeling of being moved, rather than out of love, it would be very unfair to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt very complicated inside, I looked at him, wanting to say something, but I didn't know exactly how to say it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you mean to say that you won't even give me a chance to get close to you and understand me?" Quinn saw me hesitate, so he asked again, sounding a little sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, give me a moment to think, okay? I'll let you know once I've made up my </span><span>mind," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, you can, as long as you didn't reject me like before, not giving me a chance. Other than that, I accept everything." Quinn remained as accommodating as ever, his heart as vast as the sea, not putting any pressure on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," I nodded and looked at him, unable to help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn saw me smile, and he also smiled with a sense of relief. He instinctively placed his hand on my abdomen, and at that moment, the little life inside my belly seemed to sense Quinn's presence and moved gently...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="710.html">« Prev</a><a href="712.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
