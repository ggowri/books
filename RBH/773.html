By now, Laura had caught on. However, she still harbored hostility towards me, her lips curling into a sneer:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your words sound sweet, but who knows if you truly mean to look after Elliott? Can you assure there's no ulterior motive towards Elliott?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, Elliott's injury is on me. I'm willing to take care of him, and I assure you, I have no ulterior motives. Of course, all of this is moot if you don't trust me enough. Otherwise, all my words are just empty promises."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Laura, my voice icy as I spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Laura Bryant, you know, Mr. Bryant's health has significantly improved these past few days, all thanks to Ms. Mayers' constant companionship. I think, if Ms. Mayers is willing to take care of Mr. Bryant, it would be absolutely wonderful."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry stepped forward at just the right moment, addressing Laura with due respect.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's eyes darted around quickly. She sized me up and down, still not quite believing me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you truly capable of taking good care of Elliott? I have my doubts."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've called her 'mom' for years, and yet she dares to question my character. If it weren't for Elliott's current situation, I swear I'd never want to deal with her again in my lifetime.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I trust Ms. Mayers' character. Plus, with surveillance in place, Mrs. Laura Bryant can rest easy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack spoke a word to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura finally put her inner doubts to rest. Then, she whispered:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about the woman? Should we let her go?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Until Mr. Bryant regains consciousness, it's best not to let strangers of unknown identity take care of him. Barry, go tell that woman. Ms. Mayers, please come to my office."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry nodded and took off. I sensed that Jack had something to tell me, so I followed him into his office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the two of us were in Jack's office. As soon as the door closed, Jack pushed his glasses up his nose with a serious expression:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, it's just us here. What's your take on Mr. Bryant's recent reaction?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not entirely sure, and I don't want to speculate. But I've heard whispers about some unique treatments in Norch City. What do you think, Dr. Jones?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack nodded, his expression serious as he said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I've heard the tales. Many moons ago, I was dispatched to a small hospital on the outskirts of Norch City. I treated some peculiar patients during my stint there. But that was a long time ago, and I've seldom heard of such cases since. Now, I fear that if Mr. Bryant has indeed been subjected to some sort of foul play, our modern medical prowess might not be sufficient to reverse it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack's worries mirror my own. I had thought about confronting Lisa, but without concrete evidence, it's all just speculation. If she flatly denies it, I wouldn't be able to do anything about it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Jones, do you know any experts in this field, or could you possibly ask for their assistance?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ventured to ask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know them. I was just a kid when I worked there. After I left, I gradually lost touch with the people from that place."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack shook his head in resignation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got a buddy, comes from a long line of medics, he's pretty chummy with the folks over at Norch City. I'll hit him up, see if he's got any bright ideas."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Marcus came to mind. So, right in front of Jack, I dialed Marcus' number.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="772.html">« Prev</a><a href="774.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
