As he pushed open the door to one of the rooms, a strong herbal scent hit my nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned on the light. I glanced around and saw rows of cabinets, each divided into small compartments labeled with various herb names.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This didn't look like a living space but a pharmacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, so many herbs. Can you distinguish them all?" I exclaimed in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. Not only can I distinguish them, but I also know where each herb is stored. Herbs are no joke. if you make a mistake, the consequences can be serious," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He led me inside, grabbing herbs according to the prescription he had given me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dim light in the room shone on Marcus, making this usually rugged man appear gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus made me feel reliable and trustworthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "What was his ex-wife thinking. How could she choose to give up such a man." I couldn't help but be a little curious about Marcus' personal life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I didn't ask and just quietly accompanied him to get the herbs. Then, as I watched him divide the herbs into small packets, I curiously asked him some questions about herbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was patient. He answered my questions one by one. Just as I was becoming deeply interested in herbs, my phone suddenly vibrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took out my phone. To my surprise, the message was from Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rarely initiates contact with me. This was unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked if I was around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously checked the time, realizing it was almost eleven o'clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had unknowingly spent so much time at Marcus' house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the message, I frowned unconsciously. After thinking for a while, I decided not to reply to him and put my phone back in my pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, Marcus had already packaged the herbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He led me downstairs and said, "Taking these herbs can be troublesome. I have the equipment here. I'll prepare them for you. Just heat them up when you want to drink them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That would be wasting your time. It's not necessary," I quickly refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For me, it's simple. I used to help my grandfather with herbs when I was a child. It's nothing. Don't worry about it," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting for a few moments, I decided to head home. Although Marcus' house was close to mine, he was still concerned about me going back alone. So, Marcus insisted on walking me to the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, we both put on our coats and walked out together, chatting and laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, we confirmed our collaboration on that medication. He promised to go to the Glory Group to sign the contract with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was delighted all the way. I was so happy that, at one point, I couldn't help but bounce around like a little girl. Marcus quickly asked me to calm down, afraid that my excessive energy might harm the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I increasingly realized that after leaving Elliott, I seemed to get along very easily with any person of the opposite sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I was with Quinn, we could play around like buddies and share everything, like confidants. With Adam, we had a mutual understanding as boss and employee, and occasionally, I could feel the youthful vitality from him. And with Marcus, not only did I feel the joy of reuniting with an old friend, but more importantly, I could sense the joy of mutual appreciation.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="475.html">« Prev</a><a href="477.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
