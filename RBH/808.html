Mrs. Jessica Woods and Carole were just here to drop off gifts. They didn't bother me at all. We had a pretty good chat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fearful of causing a misunderstanding between them, I quickly stood up to clarify.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Carole landed a solid punch right in Quinn's chest:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You silly boy, what's on your mind? Are we that kind of people? Mom bought a bunch of baby clothes. Knowing Madeline is around, we made a special trip to deliver them."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole gestured towards the pile of clothes and toys. Quinn glanced over, his expression finally softening a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before you come looking for Madeline next time, give me a heads up. You can't just show up unannounced. Madeline's got a lot on her plate."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was still griping, causing Carole to roll her eyes in exasperation:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you're saying we need your approval to see Madeline? Enough already, Quinn!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you two, cut it out in front of Madeline. Okay, now that we've delivered the stuff, let's not disturb Madeline's work. We wouldn't want our little rascal here to get upset&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica chuckled as she rose to her feet. She patted my hand once more before finally, reluctantly, letting go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we'll find a time to come over and see Noah. Madeline, my mom and I are going to head out now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole shot Quinn another fierce glare, then turned to me with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I escorted them out of my company's main entrance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they left, Quinn immediately spun around, gripping my shoulders with a tense urgency:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did my mom and sister give you a hard time, Madeline? Next time they corner you alone and bother you, just give me a call right away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, they didn't give me a hard time at all. On the contrary, they said a lot of heartwarming things to me. Quinn, your family is really wonderful."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched Quinn with a smile, increasingly convinced that he was indeed a remarkably reliable man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This particular family ambiance only served to enhance my impression of him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good to hear. I always knew my mom wasn't the type to make things difficult for others. My sister, though she's blunt, has a heart of gold. If she says something out of line, don't take it to heart."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn heaved a sigh of relief, then quickly turned to me and said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, they're all wonderful. It's just that I don't deserve such a wonderful family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, grinning as I spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unworthy? Madeline, don't belittle yourself. In my eyes, you're the best, and you deserve nothing less!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked at me, speaking earnestly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warm feeling inevitably filled my heart. Looking at Quinn, I realized for the first time that he seemed much more mature than when I first met him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, he was nothing more than a playboy in my eyes. But now, he's transformed into a mature, responsible man of steel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time has transformed the boy before me into a man. And now, as he speaks to me, he has shed his former frivolity and casualness, becoming so sincere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He truly is the kind of person you can entrust your life to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found myself growing more certain of Quinn. However, at the same time, I knew better than anyone that there was no love between us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems we're lacking a bit of that love hormone reaction. Perhaps, it's because I've shut my heart off after being heartbroken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, it's hard for me to fall for anyone, even Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I was unsure of how to make a decision, I chose to numb myself with work.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been on a business trip for a week, still stationed in Norch City.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton informed me that their filming in Mexico is nearing its end, and the preliminary cuts are already out. He invited me over to take a look and offer some suggestions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had heard about the unexpected incident that happened during my last visit to Norch City.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, for my safety, he didn't let me go to Mexico. Instead, he arranged for us to meet in Norch City.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="807.html">« Prev</a><a href="809.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
