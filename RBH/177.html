It was a voice message from Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, that wealthy man appeared again, and he seemed very concerned about Giselle. He even blamed Rowan for letting Giselle drink too much alcohol, and nearly ended up hitting Rowan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam probably didn't know yet, that wealthy man, who is my husband Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam's words, more and more, felt like a thorn, piercing into my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even people who didn't know Elliott could feel that he cared about Giselle, so all my guesses, I'm afraid... might be true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt really uncomfortable, so uncomfortable that I covered my head with a pillow. I didn't know how long had passed when the door of the ward was gently pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought it was Bonnie, so I didn't lift my head up, letting the tears silently fall onto the pillow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large palm was placed on my shoulder, and the warmth in the palm made me realize that the person who came in was not Bonnie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a slight start, and at that moment, I felt the bed being pressed down. Immediately after, a tall figure lay beside me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pulled back a corner of the blanket and, before I could react, enveloped me in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smelled that familiar scent and hastily wiped my tears on the pillow, but I didn't look back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott held me tightly, burying his head in my hair, and whispered softly,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle was fine, Toby was taking care of her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to be explaining something to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly calmed myself down and replied softly, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say anything more, just held me quietly like this. I thought, maybe he came back so quickly because he noticed that I wasn't feeling well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, not long after, when the sound of even breathing reached my ears, I realized that I had been overthinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't provide any further explanation and simply fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All my emotions accompanied his falling asleep, all of them suppressed deep in my heart. Those emotions were like boiling water, bubbling and churning inside me. Eventually, they slowly cooled down as time passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned around, propping my head up with one hand, and looked at Elliott, who was fast asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked very tired, probably because he was really exhausted. Even when he slept, he had a slightly furrowed brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's three-dimensional features, even when he is asleep, remain perfectly handsome. Just by quietly watching him like this, there is an irresistible urge to kiss him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that he was widely recognized as the most handsome man in high society, I admit, at this moment, as I quietly watch Elliott like this, I can still understand why I was captivated by him at first sight all those years ago. Just by loving Elliott, I was able to endure years of humiliation and indifference from him... Elliott's face is definitely the main reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying together with him like this should have been such a happy thing, and it's something I have been longing for all these years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Elliott lies beside me so truthfully, and I can clearly feel the warmth of his embrace, yet my heart does not beat as fiercely as it did before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the contrary, I felt that my heart and Elliott's were far apart, far beyond measure, like separated by a galaxy, and within that galaxy, there was also a Giselle.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="176.html">« Prev</a><a href="178.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
