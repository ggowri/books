Now I'm just afraid that everyone in Hoswich City will know that you celebrated a woman's birthday tonight when they hear your singing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and looked at him. I wanted to see how he would react.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked indifferent and didn't seem to take it seriously. Suddenly, he picked up the phone at the bedside and dialed a number directly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was late at night, and the silence in the room made the voice on the phone particularly clear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call was answered quickly, and Barry's sound was heard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, may I do anything for you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call the editor-in-chief of Newsweek and ask her to tell her reporters not to write or report on my affairs. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott ordered directly into the phone. He seemed to be disgusted, which made my heart sink slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he was not happy about this being exposed. Maybe he didn't want me and his affairs to be publicized and reported by the public.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, I'll call her right away, ask her to delete the video immediately, and erase all traces."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, let her reporters change the title. She is not my new lover, but my beloved wife."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did not expect Elliott would say this, which made my heart beat wildly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand. I will do it now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry received the instruction, immediately hung up the phone, and executed it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only three minutes passed, and I was shocked to see that the title of the video had been changed from "New Lover" to "Beloved Wife."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was already lying next to me. He had just taken a shower, and his whole body was exuding the fragrance of shower gel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I was still staring at the phone, he lifted my chin and whispered, "Aren't you going to take a shower?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I looked at him, tears flowed out of my eyes for some reason.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you say before that you would never admit your relationship with me? Why..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was indeed moved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had experienced such a long period of being ignored and hidden by him. I had never heard him admit his relationship with me so willingly until now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was the only one who knew how difficult it was to endure this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he knew that I had hidden medical problems and that I might not be able to conceive his child, but he still chose to tell everyone that I was his wife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must be doing this because he loves me, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at him blankly and was embraced by him again. His tight muscles and broad arms were so strong. He smiled softly and said, "The past has passed. Things are different now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was telling me that everything in the past was different now, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my head, held his neck with one hand, and confirmed again,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Paige is pregnant now, but I will most likely never be a mother. Don't you mind? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, after hearing Paige was pregnant, I felt both surprise and depressed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Becoming a mother should be a right given to every woman by the Creator.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for some reason, I was deprived of this right. This made me feel sad the moment I heard the news of any woman's pregnancy.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="284.html">« Prev</a><a href="286.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
