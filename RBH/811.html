In no time, they whipped up a feast, complete with wine. They set up the dining table in the yard, and we all gathered around it, tucking into the meal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During dinner, everyone was chatting and laughing, creating a lively and cheerful atmosphere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While I was dining, I noticed Marcus and Jane exchanging glances every now and then. There seemed to be an uncanny harmony and intimacy between them as they chatted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, I couldn't help but jest:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, I see you two are living quite comfortably here, like a little husband and wife running a farm together."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I said this, Adam and the colleagues dining with us burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face flushed in an instant:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, don't get it twisted. Mr. Brown and I are just business partners. We're merely friends, nothing more."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly chimed in:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you can't just joke around like that. It's one thing to tease me, but you can't tarnish Jane's reputation."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why so serious, you two?" I chuckled, winking playfully. "Honestly, a little jesting now and then doesn't hurt. Look at you both, single and well-versed in traditional medicinal materials. Aren't you two a perfect match?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Jane's been single for years now, but I never realized Mr. Brown was a bachelor too. You know, you two would make quite a pair&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam immediately joined in the fun.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the other colleagues chimed in. They were all subordinates who had come over with Marcus and Jane to do the preliminary work. Then, they started reminiscing about the fun times Jane and Marcus had shared at the base over the past month.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere instantly turned lively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of nowhere, someone suggested that Jane and Marcus share a drink. Suddenly, everyone started cheering them on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face was already flushed a deep red, and Marcus, unusually, was standing there grinning like a fool. Amidst the cheering of the crowd, the two of them stood up and shared a toast.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right at the peak of the excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Adam nudged my shoulder:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, check out the outside."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't understand why, but instinctively, I turned my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, I took a glance, and in an instant, I was completely dumbstruck.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At some point, a striking figure began to stand guard at the entrance of the courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was clad in dark casual attire, his black ensemble almost blending with the twilight outside the yard. The overly spacious backdrop made him appear exceptionally tall and upright.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect it, but he actually found his way here. And by the looks of it, he'd been standing at the door for quite some time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I abruptly rose to my feet. Seeing this, everyone else began to cast their glances towards the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they saw Elliott standing at the door, everyone was stunned. Laughter abruptly ceased, replaced by a moment of deafening silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like I've come at a bad time, have I interrupted something?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual smile, Elliott strolled into the courtyard, one hand tucked nonchalantly into his pocket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did I notice, trailing behind him was Barry. And in Barry's hands, he was lugging a whole heap of stuff...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="810.html">« Prev</a><a href="812.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
