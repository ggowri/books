He said firmly once again, "But I don't want you to suffer. There's no need for a girl to endure such hardships! Elliott can't give you happiness, but I'm willing to! Besides, Madeline, think about it. If I don't recognize this baby as mine, once you get pregnant and give birth to the baby, do you think Elliott and the Bryant family won't be suspicious? They care so much about their offspring. Do you think they will allow you to live in peace? I've been pondering about this matter for a long time. Since you've decided to separate from Elliott, I'd prefer you to move on to a new life, lest you get entangled with them again in the future, which will only keep you stuck in this past forever and unable to escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's words set me in deep thought for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation he described had actually crossed my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby came suddenly. I would definitely cherish it like a treasure, but with Elliott's sharpness, he would likely discern that the baby was his. If he confronted me about it, it would indeed be challenging for me to explain the origin of the baby for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, how could I involve Quinn in this ordeal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to say more, but Quinn simply halted me, like a tranquilizer, and said calmly, "Madeline, stop refusing me. It's the quickest way to help you move on from the past, and it's also the best way to ensure the baby's well-being. I have thought about it, and I am willing to take the responsibility of fathering the baby. Of course, if you ever meet the right man, I can leave right away if he is willing to accept you and the baby with sincerity. Anyway, my only wish is to stand by your side and ensure your happiness. That's my lifelong mission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's sincere words deeply touched me, yet I couldn't help but feel confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could sense that rather than love, Quinn was more of a loving and supportive confidant to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's selfless actions were all for my benefit. Yet, I couldn't help but wonder how I could deserve such unique care from him when he gained nothing from me in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, why are you always so nice to me? You and I aren't family. You don't have to..." I couldn't help but mumble, looking at Quinn. I just felt so confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn petted my nose and smiled gently, "Think of it as me and you getting along. Why do you dwell on it so much? Anyway, this matter is settled, and it's also considered as my compensation for you taking care of me for so many days. Okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can make it up to me with anything. There's no need to pay for the rest of your life." I still shook my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, however, pressed on, not bothering with my retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, regardless of your willingness, I'll be the father of the baby in your belly. With me in everything, you only need to rest peacefully and give birth to the baby, and you don't need to worry about anything else, understand?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="532.html">« Prev</a><a href="534.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
