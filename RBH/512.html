He lay there quietly, looking charming and gentle. His lips were slightly pouting, making him more adorable than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of his body was exposed, so I quickly tucked him in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to sit down, he suddenly grabbed my hand and muttered, "Madeline..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously wanted to withdraw my hand, but he held it tightly and had no intention of letting go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed people tended to be more vulnerable when they were sick or injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled faintly, letting him hold my hand, and sat beside him quietly with my chin in my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time crawled by. The noisy hospital gradually became quieter as the night progressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was conscious at first, but then, I lay on the edge of the bed and fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I woke up, I found myself covered in a thick coat. Quinn was awake, lying on the bed and swiping his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I woke up, Quinn patted me on my head, saying with distress, "You'll feel tired sleeping like this. Sleep in bed for a while. I feel better, so I lie on the small bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at my phone and saw that it was almost four o'clock in the morning. I was shocked to realize I had slept on my stomach for so long. No wonder I felt pain all over when I woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, don't move. I'll lie on the small bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Quinn about to get up, I quickly waved my hand. I stood up, walked to the side, opened the folding bed, and sat on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not dawn yet. You can get more sleep. You'll be cold if you're only covered with a coat. Take this blanket."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn pointed to the blanket on his body and motioned for me to take it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, the coat is enough. You can also sleep for a while. You need a good rest now," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I lay on the small bed and covered myself with the coat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared with the hospital in Hoswich, People's Hospital of Carthage had poor conditions. Not only was there no air conditioning in the ward but there was also no bathroom. There was only one public bathroom on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to fall asleep again, I heard the creaking of the hospital bed. I was awakened and saw Quinn struggling to get up in the dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat up hurriedly and asked, "Why are you up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn probably didn't expect that he would wake me up. He was surprised and said awkwardly, "I'm fine. Go back to sleep. I'm going to the bathroom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until then that I realized I couldn't take care of him in some ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly said, "Don't move. I'll go outside and ask them to help you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately got up, turned on the light, and opened the door. I thought Quinn's colleagues would be waiting outside, but they all left and probably went downstairs to provide support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no one outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately stepped forward and said, "They should have all gone downstairs to provide support. Quinn, I'll help you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. I can go by myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn tried to be tough. But when he stood up, he probably tore the wound and couldn't help but let out a painful sound.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="511.html">« Prev</a><a href="513.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
