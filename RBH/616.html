She pulled me into Paige's ward and closed the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gasped for breath and said, "It's Giselle who wants to jump off the rooftop of the hospital. She had given birth to Elliott's child and should have been accepted by the Bryant family. Why would she suddenly do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was it her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was surprised and thought of something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because of the request I made to Elliott? Elliott asked Giselle to go abroad, and she couldn't accept it. So, she was threatening Elliott with suicide?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle may not have the intention of killing herself. What does she want? Let's go and figure it out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige liked all kinds of gossip. Upon hearing that, she got off the hospital bed and intended to go to the rooftop with Fiona and me, not considering her condition at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you kidding? You just had a miscarriage and need to rest in bed. Madeline and I will have a look. Stay here, and I will send you a video."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was forced to lie down again, looking disappointed. Fiona and I left the ward and quickly made our way to the rooftop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was early in the morning, the staff and security personnel in the hospital, as well as the police, had gathered there before I arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I stood still, I saw Elliott. He was standing in front of the crowd, talking to Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Giselle came prepared. She had just given birth and was still weak. On such a cold day, she was only wearing a white chiffon dress. Her hair was disheveled as she sat on the railing, crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that she's not going to commit suicide on impulse. She dressed so elegantly as if she was putting on a performance," Fiona saw through Giselle immediately and whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think she had rehearsed a play in her mind. Let's walk forward and listen to what they are saying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded. Soon, I arrived at the front of the crowd with Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard Elliott's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, let's talk. It's dangerous there. Come over to me first..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, take care of our son. I know you don't hate him. You just dislike me. I will end my life, and you won't have to send him and me abroad anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle wiped her tears sadly, looking desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can discuss it. It's windy and dangerous up there. Come down quickly," Elliott said patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to move forward. However, as soon as he took a step, Giselle exclaimed in panic, "Elliott, don't approach me. If you take another step forward, I will jump immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Giselle took off her shoes and stood up barefoot. She might fall at any moment, causing a commotion among the crowd, who started to discuss the next moment.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="615.html">« Prev</a><a href="617.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
