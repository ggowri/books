I used to mock Laura whenever I had the chance, causing her to lose her dignity once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was so angry with me that her chest heaved violently. She pointed at me, and her fingers were trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you... you... you have gone too far! It was you who couldn't bear a baby, not that the Bryant family didn't want you. Even if you divorced Elliott, don't forget that I am a senior. How could you be so disrespectful to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Senior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I heard this word, I was truly speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wondered if Laura would bring up this matter, but I didn't expect her to mention it voluntarily. At that moment, I couldn't help but mock, "Senior? You? Are you so shameless that you call yourself a senior? In these three years, I respected you, but how did you treat me in return? You found a mistress for your son, and you secretly let the mistress get pregnant. You even drove me out of the Bryant family. Did you think of yourself as a senior when you did all of these? Don't forget that when the Bryant family was on the verge of bankruptcy, it was me who married Elliott with my assets. I saved all of you! I never expected that once you achieved your goal, you would hurt me! Your weird-looking grandson is your karma!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I finished speaking, Grey helped me. She deliberately placed her hand on my swollen belly and proudly said, "Look, Madeline has been married to Elliott for three years and they accuse her of not being able to have a baby. But she just started dating my nephew Quinn and she's already pregnant. So, it was not Madeline's problem. That child doesn't look like Elliott, so I suggest Mrs. Bryant quickly do a paternity test, maybe your son has a problem, and that child might have a problem too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey was good at mocking, just like Quinn and Carole. It seemed that the Woods family had an extraordinary talent for retaliating with words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey and I worked so well together that we managed to infuriate Laura to the point where she rolled her eyes. She wanted to argue back, but for a long time, she couldn't utter a complete sentence. Perhaps she was so furious that she was actually rendered unconscious by our actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this situation, everyone quickly helped her to the side. It took a while before Laura finally woke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her, helpless and disheveled, I felt satisfaction in my heart. And at that moment, Grey took my hand and said, "Madeline, enough is enough. Benjamin is still waiting for you in the vineyard over there. Let's go have a coffee!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey also completely ignored Laura, so she directly pulled me and walked towards the nearby vineyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This quarrel made me feel particularly cheerful. Grey and I chatted and laughed all the way, and soon we saw two men sitting under the gazebo in the middle of the vineyard. One was wearing a light-colored polo shirt with light-colored trousers, while the other was dressed in a dark-colored business casual suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched the back of the man wearing a light-colored polo shirt and felt strangely familiar. I was just about to ask him who he was when he turned around and quickly gave me a bright smile...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="628.html">« Prev</a><a href="630.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
