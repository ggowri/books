Our company is working on a few copyrights, whose themes are similar to Allure. If there is a suitable role for you, I can notify you to audition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't hesitate. After all, it was good to have someone cause trouble to Giselle for me, so I agreed immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then I'll wait for your good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia stood up and reached out to me as if she wanted to reconcile with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook hands with her, then turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did not expect that Sylvia would work so hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That afternoon, she sent me several videos. The background of the video was the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She carried some flowers and pretended to visit Giselle. However, her real purpose was to provoke Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deliberately went there when Elliott and Laura were not there. The flowers she took there were normally for dead people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was lying on the bed, but Sylvia made her so angry that she got out of bed and wanted to fight with Sylvia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Giselle was so angry that she started to bleed again, and soon she was pushed into the operating room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Giselle who was screaming hysterically in the video, I felt happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, maybe it was because Doctor Louis's medical skills were superb or Giselle's child was strong enough, that the child was still alive and well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Giselle met a lot of problems since she was pregnant, and then they found out there was something wrong with the fetus. Now she had experienced a series of miscarriage treatments. I didn't know how her child would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, I quickly prayed to God, hoping that my baby would be safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching the videos, I summoned the executives of the Glory Group for a brief meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The successful investment in Allure and the anti-flu capsule allowed the Glory Group to quickly gain a lot of cash in a short time, which solved the financial pressure faced by the Glory Group after Jade and the others left. It also made the executives confident in me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the summary, I released my plans for this year. I still planned to invest in a few more TV series and movies in the film and television field and develop more in-depth cooperation with Tigress Pharmacy Company. In addition to the anti-flu capsule, we also planned to cooperate in several other drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't like long meetings, so I ended the meeting after expressing all my ideas concisely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meeting, Adam brought me a cup of milk considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he came in, he gave me a thumbs-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you are an excellent leader now. You looked so cool just now in the meeting! I even want to let the screenwriter write a story about the growth of women in the workplace according to your performance! I think it will be popular!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam became more skilled in flattering, and I couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I recalled that in my previous life, a TV series called Nothing but Thirty became popular all over the country this year. Its story was based on three women with different personalities and backgrounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was just casually chatting, but I was inspired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, what you just suggested is a good idea! Check if there is a novel called Nothing but Thirty. If you find it, send it to me. I want to have a look!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="558.html">« Prev</a><a href="560.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
