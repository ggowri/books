So, he directly called two security guards and had Giselle expelled from the club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We followed closely behind and also walked out of the clubhouse's gate, where we saw Giselle being lifted across the road by two security guards working together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had just drunk so much alcohol that she was already intoxicated. The security guards tried to wake Giselle several times, but to no avail. They had no choice but to throw her on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Giselle lying motionless on the ground, Quinn sighed and dialed Toby's phone number, asking him to come and take Giselle away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige said indignantly, "Quinn, you are too kind. This woman ruined Madeline's life, and we should just throw her away like garbage. Giselle would be better off being picked up by a homeless person! I can't believe you called Toby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She had already lost everything, so let's give her a little hope to survive. Madeline, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn turned to me, eagerly awaiting my response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was indeed a sincere and kind man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, spare Giselle. She won't be able to ruin my life anymore in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did we just let her go so easily? If we had known it would turn out like this, we should have beaten her up together earlier!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige still felt sorry for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything that happened last night has made her more miserable than slapping her a thousand times. The most unbearable thing for women like Giselle is that when they are about to reach the peak of their lives, they suddenly fall hard. She is unlikely to have another chance to succeed in her lifetime!" Fiona immediately chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige saw that we all agreed, so she stopped insisting. She let out a big yawn and then said to us, "Well, let's just let Giselle off the hook for now. It's getting late, so let's all go back early."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Quinn arranged for drivers to send each of us back to our respective homes. And since my home was the farthest, Quinn arranged for me to go last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he saw off Paige and Fiona, it was already 4 o'clock in the morning when he accompanied me back home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at the slightly brightening sky, unusually awake, and had completely lost any trace of sleepiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car slowly drove through this city that I am extremely familiar with. Perhaps it was because I hadn't fallen asleep yet, the baby inside my belly was unusually active.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The increasingly strong fetal movements made me realize that I was about to become a mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby was very well-behaved. He must have known that I had a lot of things to do, so since the early stages of pregnancy, he rarely made me feel tired. Thus, besides the gradually growing belly, I almost forgot that I was pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The thing that has been bothering you the most has already ended. From now on, you just need to focus on taking good care of yourself and wait patiently for the baby to be born, okay?" Quinn saw me holding my stomach and then he reached out and affectionately touched my head, gently saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, alright. Next, I will truly experience the joy of being a mother, eat and sleep more, and take good care of the baby. I've noticed that when I don't sleep, he doesn't sleep either, and he moves a lot in my belly. Look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and then gestured to Quinn to look at my belly.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="657.html">« Prev</a><a href="659.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
