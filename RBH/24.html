Despite being reluctant, she still stood up and left the private room in a huff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The partner, Jacob James, stood at the door, momentarily stunned by the subtle atmosphere inside the private room, unsure whether he should enter or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Elliott, being the kind of person he was, would never bow down and grovel to a small copyright holder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't have such a big ego, after all, the person in front of me was my guarantee of making money in the near future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood up straight and walked over with a smile on my face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, I am honored to have the opportunity to invite you for dinner tonight. Please come, please have a seat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"May I ask, who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He awkwardly and politely asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. James, I am Madeline, Elliott's wife. Nice to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I had already fully immersed myself in the role and willingly extended my hand, saying with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... So you are Mrs. Bryant. Nice to meet you. Please have a seat as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Jacob heard that I was Mrs. Elliott, he got excited and quickly and respectfully asked me to sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. James, this is my husband, Elliott. However, he was usually serious and not very talkative, so please don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat down and introduced Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob heard me say this and quickly nodded to Elliott to say hello.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's expression darkened. Jacob greeted him, but he only nodded slightly, exuding such a strong presence that no one could ignore his existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob appeared to be very reserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, in order to make Jacob relax, I deliberately started chatting with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dishes were brought up one after another. Each dish looked particularly tempting, with both its appearance and taste being top-notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept chatting with Jacob, while Elliott sat silently in the compartment, not uttering a word from beginning to end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I noticed that his phone screen would light up and then go dark, and then go dark and then light up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that Sylvia kept calling him or sending him messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling, why didn't you eat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of others, calling him like this can also be considered as showing respect to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott was not grateful, he still had a cold face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I used to eat less for dinner, you don't have to worry about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did, however, tacitly agree to let me entertain Jacob... I was instantly delighted in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed unaware that the purpose of my coming here tonight was not out of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was like this, serious even at home, except for the rumors, he didn't seem like a young person in other aspects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately teased Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face immediately grew darker, and he warned me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was joking, actually he loved me very much. Those rumors were all false. He would give me anything I liked, he was very generous to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I started to lay the groundwork for my upcoming negotiation with Jacob without showing any signs, but Elliott remained completely oblivious, still thinking that I was just engaging in idle chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was slow to start discussing work with Jacob, and Elliott gradually lost patience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott picked up his phone and glanced at it. I didn't know what Sylvia had said to him, but he frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He completely lost his patience and interrupted our conversation with Jacob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. James, I have limited time, let's get straight to the point. How much is your intended price for this play?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="23.html">« Prev</a><a href="25.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
