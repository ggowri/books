She screamed at the top of her lungs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, spare me. I will never dare again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott coldly shouted, and at the same time, he simply gestured with his hand, and the two bodyguards who came with him immediately stepped forward and ruthlessly slapped Nicole's face, one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong, I'm sorry, Ms. Mayers, Ms. Hart, I was wrong. I confess. I will never dare to do it again in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole was terrified. As soon as Elliott roared, she immediately started bowing and apologizing incessantly to me and Sylvia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Probably annoyed by her nagging, Elliott had her dragged out directly after she desperately apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden apology left the three of us a little confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, she was clearly taken to the police station. Why did you bring her here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't figure out what Elliott was thinking at that moment, so I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had just sent her to the police station, she would have been released after a while. In order to prevent her from hurting you again, I directly had Toby deported. She is not allowed to return to the country without my permission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said in a low voice, and the moment he mentioned Toby, I understood his intention for being here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, deporting her is too lenient! Elliott, you're not here to plead for us on behalf of Toby, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My tone instantly became sharp as I looked at Elliott, but my expression was not friendly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Toby is no longer my driver. The Bryant family has no further connection with him. The reason I had him deported was to prevent him from causing any more accidents like today that could harm you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I was somewhat angry, Elliott suddenly walked over. In front of Sylvia and Quinn, he directly lifted my chin and carefully examined my face. There were obvious bloodshot eyes in his eyes, probably due to staying up late these past few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw my face and realized that there was nothing wrong. Only then did he breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard someone had their appearance ruined, and my first reaction was you. Luckily, you're fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His concern for me was too sudden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but frown, feeling a bit awkward. I instinctively wanted to push his hand away, but to my surprise, he not only didn't let go, but instead tightened his grip and directly embraced my shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never expected such a thing to happen on my turf, it must have startled you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, did you think I was invisible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn remained in place. Seeing Elliott treating me like this, he immediately approached and grabbed my hand, trying to pull me out of Elliott's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott's hand clung to me tightly like a pair of pliers, unwilling to let go. He provocatively stared at Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, Madeline was already my woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget, you had already divorced a long time ago. Is it meaningful for you to keep bothering her like this? Elliott, this is not like you! You are not the kind of person who would persistently pursue someone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's chest heaved rapidly. I could feel that he had been trying his best to endure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop bringing up our divorce. Even if we are divorced, she is still mine because we will eventually remarry. Quinn, stop hovering around her. You are not that kind of person either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sneered. There was a hint of mockery in his cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked at Elliott, not knowing what to say. In the end, he approached and forcefully pushed Elliott away, who was holding my hand, and dragged me forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't want our relationship to turn out like this today. But if you insist on it, I won't back down either! Elliott, you are pushing me and challenging my limits!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="675.html">« Prev</a><a href="677.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
