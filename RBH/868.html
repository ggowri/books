I'll have the driver take you there."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't whip up breakfast like he usually would, nor did he insist on personally dropping me off. It seemed that last night's events had left him feeling pretty down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I drove myself to Glory Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once in the office, I sank into the plush leather chair and started tackling the paperwork on my desk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Halfway through, there was a knock at the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught sight of a towering, robust figure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile graced his handsome, profound face, the previous desolation completely swept away. It was as if the awkwardness of last night had never happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His powerful aura seemed to dim the lights in my office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dropped the document, instinctively glanced at my watch, and asked, "What brings you here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought last night's incident would have him stewing for a while. But to my surprise, he actually showed up at Glory Group looking for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held a thermos in his hand, speaking gently:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heard you coughing last night, so I had the chef whip up some chicken soup for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the latter part of last night, I indeed found myself coughing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was just a few coughs, nothing I paid much attention to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he actually heard it, and took it to heart!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The CEO of Bryant Group actually took time out of his busy schedule to personally deliver chicken soup to me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, this was something utterly inconceivable&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's really as meticulous as ever now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, it felt as if we had swapped roles. I had become the one impervious to harm, while he had turned into the one desperately trying to please and win me over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took the thermos, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a few coughs and you heard it. Were you up all night?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I popped open the lid of the thermos, instantly greeted by the savory aroma of chicken soup. The soup was still hot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly felt a wave of blissful contentment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I can catch a wink?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott shot back a question at me. Then, picking up a spoon, he ladled some chicken soup from the thermos and brought it to my lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He insisted on feeding me, so I had no choice but to open my mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bird's nest soup was quickly finished, and Elliott pulled me down to sit on the sofa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Busy morning? You seemed swamped when I walked in&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been poring over these reports all morning, my eyes are about to cross."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Let me give you a massage."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could react, his warm fingers had already begun to gently press around my eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His technique was professional, massaging circles around my eyes. It was incredibly soothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without realizing it, I found myself nestled in his arms, quietly savoring the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the caf&eacute; waitress gently knocked on my office door. Dressed in a sleek black professional suit, she carried a cup of coffee. Placing it on the table, she politely said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, sir, here's your mocha coffee. Enjoy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, thanks."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott flashed her a grateful smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seems like he grabbed a coffee at our new employee caf&eacute; when he came in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the waiter had departed, Elliott spoke up:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Glory Group is really taking off now. Never thought you'd have such a knack for business."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tone was filled with admiration, a kind of recognition I had seldom received before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott rarely gives compliments in the business world, and he doesn't consider anyone as his equal.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="867.html">« Prev</a><a href="869.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
