There was also a humidifier on the desk, and a cute teddy bear cushion on my chair. Additionally, there was a paper cup placed on my desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These thoughtful arrangements, needless to say, must have been done by Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, what did you bring me today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at these things and couldn't help but feel happy, so I shouted loudly outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam immediately responded and came in, smiling brightly as soon as he entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, the weather has been quite dry lately, so I prepared a humidifier for you. This latte was freshly bought this morning, so it is still warm. Hurry up and drink it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, thank you." I smiled at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, have you heard about the things regarding Giselle in the past few days?" Adam couldn't help but gossip with me when he saw that I was in a good mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you mention the thing about her and Elliott? I heard about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I responded lightly, not telling him that I was the mastermind behind the whole thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, everyone knew about that thing a long time ago. After that incident, Mr. Cormac Bryant passed away. I heard that Elliott was particularly angry and demanded that Giselle pay for his grandfather's death. So, guess what happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam immediately said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past few days, I have been staying at home with Austin and Lily, hardly looking at my phone or paying attention to the news. So, Adam's words caught me off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle left a suicide note and jumped into the sea. Her family reported it to the police. The authorities only found a pair of high heels she had worn at the spot where she jumped into the sea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam spoke slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt somewhat incredulous. I started to become somewhat excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never imagined that this woman, who caused chaos in both my past and current lives, would die like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I wished more than anyone for her to pay the price, to feel all my pain and receive the deserved retribution, I still felt so sudden when I heard this news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That night, there was a strong storm. The police determined through surveillance footage that she had jumped into the sea, but they searched for a long time and couldn't find her body. To be honest, I felt quite uneasy upon hearing this news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam spoke again, his tone somewhat heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to say something, but I didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, as long as you have done a little harm to others, villains would wish for you to die, but kind-hearted people always choose forgiveness and mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hated Giselle, but I never thought about making her die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that she would ultimately choose to end her life by jumping into the sea. It was really sudden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, the Bryant family has sent a notice and hopes that you can attend the funeral of Mr. Cormac Bryant. Take a look..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam then took out another letter and handed it to me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="662.html">« Prev</a><a href="664.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
