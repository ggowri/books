You have your own matters and people to take care of too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suppressed my inner emotions as much as possible, trying to remain rational.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to become an unreasonable lunatic again, driven crazy by a man entangled in my life for two lifetimes. It wasn't worth it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you wait for me to investigate everything. But until I figure things out, you are not allowed to overthink or meddle in other things. And absolutely no mention of divorce, understood?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott laid out another condition. Obviously, he knew he was in the wrong, but he didn't want to give up on me easily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, despite his repeated claims that there was nothing between him and Giselle, the child was a fact, and that photo was also a fact.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lowered my head, pondering for a while before decisively saying, "Sorry, I can't agree to that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that I couldn't agree, but suddenly I felt that I didn't want to be controlled and constrained by Elliott anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why should Elliott get involved in such things and still demand this from me? It didn't make sense. I also didn't want to become his accessory, letting him dictate everything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't expect my refusal. He wanted to say something more, but at that moment, his phone rang.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out his phone, glanced at it with a furrowed brow, but still answered it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, where did you go? Hurry back to the hospital! Giselle said she can't breathe properly now and wants to see you right away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Laura's high-pitched voice came through the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like Laura and Giselle had built a seamless wall between me and Elliott, desperately trying to keep us apart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't say anything and hung up the phone. He looked at me, the guilt in his eyes sinking my heart to the bottom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go, after all, she's still carrying your child."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended to smile indifferently, but my heart ached as if stabbed by sharp knives.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shouldn't the one really struggling to breathe be me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go check, in case something happens, I'm afraid Grandpa..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had obviously made up his mind. His explanation felt forced to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't say much. I nodded, gesturing for him to get out of the car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked deeply into my eyes, instinctively cupping my face. But as he leaned in again to kiss me, I quickly avoided it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my dodge, he understood my intentions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's lips moved as if to say something. But in the end, he said nothing, just jumped out of the car, braving the heavy rain, and quickly walked into Bryant Hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tall and sturdy figure gradually disappeared before me once again. This time, Elliott was heading towards another woman.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, my heart felt like it was being twisted and spasmed, causing my stomach to ache terribly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't hold it back, quickly opened the car door, and vomited violently for a long time...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="382.html">« Prev</a><a href="384.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
