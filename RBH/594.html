When she saw Elliott approaching, Paige instinctively opened her arms to shield me, despite her heavily pregnant belly, and sternly warned Elliott, "Elliott, what are you doing? I warn you, you and Madeline have no relationship now, you better stay away from her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't even spare Paige a glance. His gaze landed directly on me as he spoke, "Giselle went into premature labor, you must have heard, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone remained calm, devoid of any new fatherly joy. Instead, I noticed his furrowed brow, hinting at a heavy heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, how are both Giselle and the baby?" I asked nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The baby is too small, already in the neonatal intensive care unit, Giselle just had a severe hemorrhage and is still in emergency care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone remained composed, but his unfathomable gaze remained fixed on me. I stared back into his eyes, only seeing endless enigmas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In our moments of deep affection, we had once fantasized about becoming parents, imagining how happy and joyful we would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had also imagined that Elliott would be waiting outside the delivery room, just like he was for Giselle, eagerly anticipating the arrival of our child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, our child was quietly growing in my belly while our relationship had long since shattered, never to return to its former glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at the bright red light emanating from the operating room, a bitter feeling surging in my heart, a sudden jealousy overwhelming my emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I let out a bitter laugh, unable to resist a sarcastic remark. "So, how does it feel to be a father? Must be exhilarating, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew I was provoking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left my mouth, a flash of hidden pain appeared on Elliott's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swallowed and calmly replied, "It's too early to feel excited, considering the uncertainty of the child's health and Giselle's condition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his calm demeanor unsettled me, especially the tinge of worry in his voice when mentioning Giselle, making me uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps, if it weren't for your push, maybe the child wouldn't have been born so soon. You should feel guilty now, shouldn't you?" I asked coldly once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige stood in silence, unaware of what was happening, looking at me and Elliott with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Elliott replied in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those simple words felt like a heavy weight on my heart, dragging it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a commotion erupted in the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, wailing cries echoed through the entire hallway.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="593.html">« Prev</a><a href="595.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
