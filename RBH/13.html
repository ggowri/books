What tricks are you gonna play?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice carried a consistent tone of sarcasm. He thought I was playing tricks again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it normal to prepare late-night meals for them? As long as we haven't divorced, I am still their daughter-in-law. Shouldn't I be kind to them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever effort you put in will be in vain. Madeline, forget about being pregnant with my child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott still guarded against me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, did he still think I was the woman who always wanted to have his baby back then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am about to start working at my father's company, so I have no plans to be pregnant now. Elliott, you can rest assured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To talk him out of doubting me, I simply told him about my plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, upon hearing it, he even snorted and chuckled lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can you do at your father's company? I'm afraid any college graduate at your father's company would have been more professional than you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, my ability was so poor that I couldn't even compare to an ordinary employee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not necessarily true, Elliott, you are wrong to look down on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admitted his words hurt me. I got excited and rolled over, taking over the blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, could you please sleep in a better posture? Also, did you just say I was wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, Elliott reached out and grabbed a corner of the blanket. But by then, I had wrapped myself up in the blanket, leaving him completely exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, give me the blanket."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I am warning you. Don't act as you please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my sleeping habit. If you don't like it, you can go sleep in another room!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't be arrogant because my parents are here to protect you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I listen to you? If you have the guts, bite me then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My in-laws' approval in the evening gave me some confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't care about what Elliott was thinking in his mind. If he wanted to argue, I wouldn't dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would never have dared to do so in my previous life. After all, his tyrannical temper was well-known. If he told me to go east, how could I dare to go west?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now I was not afraid anymore. In the worst scenario, I would get a divorce. Once no longer afraid of losing the most precious thing, a person would become fearless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was pitch black at this moment, so I couldn't see Elliott's expression at all. However, from his heavy breathing, I could imagine just how angry he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Elliott, you used to let me suffer so much. Tonight, I'll let you pay for it. Since you refuse to leave, then just cool off naked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay cozily wrapped in the blanket, feeling as warm as the bed. Soon, I became quite sleepy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to doze off, I suddenly felt something heavy on my body. Elliott pressed on top of me, and I could feel his warm skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aware of the danger, I instinctively started struggling. But to my surprise, he grabbed both of my hands and pinned my arms above my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I doing? Didn't you ask me to bite you? Do you think I dare not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face came close to me, so close that I could feel the faint smell of alcohol in his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall and sturdy man of 6ft was pressing heavily on top of me through the blanket. The unusual intimacy stunned me. My heart suddenly beat faster. My breathing became rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you said that you would rather spend money on a hooker than touch me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't be sure of what he was up to. I could only defend myself by shouting but lacked confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say anything, but his face was getting closer and closer. His lips were almost touching mine...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My whole heart suddenly felt like being thrown into an oiled pan and becoming scorching. My heart was pounding, almost about to burst out of my throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind suddenly got out of control. My thoughts couldn't help wandering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he want to kiss me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Come on, we had never kissed since we got married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would he really sleep with me tonight out of impulse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, absolutely not! I would never let such a thing happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why couldn't I help but swallow my saliva? Deep down, was I anticipating something to happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I told myself in my mind, "Madeline, don't be a fool. You can't forget how he used to harm you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if two persons were constantly fighting in my mind. I was torn between sensibility and rationality. Within a few seconds, they had thought for over a hundred times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to push him away, but he was too heavy. My hand was still controlled by him. I didn't have any strength to push him away at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips began to gently caress mine. The cool and soft touch made me tremble uncontrollably...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept telling myself to be rational and clear-headed. But Elliott had so many lovers before. He really got on my nerves with his constant, ambiguous teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was messed up by him. My whole body stiffened. I was just like a fish drained off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't dare to move or breathe, while he was slowly and continuously tried kissing me. When his tongue touched my teeth, my body felt a sudden jolt as if electrified...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, I had never kissed anyone like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was the next step?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind was completely in a mess. For a moment, I didn't know how to react. I closed my eyes when his tongue pried open my lips...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his tongue touched mine, I instinctively stuck out my tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My breathing became heavy. I couldn't describe the whole new experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All my remaining rationality was taken away by Elliott. I realized that I was on the verge of losing my bottom line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it. I lacked dating experience and was no match for an experienced man like Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was completely controlled by him. Both my body and mind were breaking down.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="12.html">« Prev</a><a href="14.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
