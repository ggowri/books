Could it be that the chairman has regained consciousness?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know, she didn't say. We'll find out when she arrives."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meeting room, the shareholders discussed among themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I walked in, everyone quieted down and turned their gaze towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing what I said, several shareholders immediately became furious. One of them stood up right away. "Is it true? Who has the audacity to do such a thing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at who handled these projects and then look at how much her personal assets have grown over the years. You'll understand," I said, taking out another document detailing Jade's assets that I had investigated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everyone took a look at those documents, they quickly understood what was going on. And these pieces of evidence were all collected by me bit by bit since I entered Glory Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the shareholders finished reading, they all looked grim. They were furious and expressed their desire to bring Jade to justice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their utterly different attitude towards her now, I felt more assured. I said, "This is why I opposed her overseeing Glory Group. Everyone was deceived before. Now, I think everyone knows what to do, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't let such a person continue to stay in Glory Group."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only can we not let her stay in Glory Group, but we must also make her return all the embezzled money."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have this evidence, we can definitely report her to the police. Since she dares to behave like this, we must make her face legal consequences!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it came to their own interests, these shareholders wouldn't turn a blind eye to Jade's misconduct. They all began to stand by Madeline's side, accusing Jade.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I looked at them, I couldn't help but think of the previous life. At that time, they also united like this and impeached my father out of office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how good Jade's relationship was with them usually, as long as it touched their interests, they would all turn against her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, I didn't need to do much more next. Presumably, they would take care of Jade.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade, this malignant tumor, was finally removed from Glory Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as I felt relieved, suddenly, my phone started blaring an alarm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was abrupt, like the alarm from the surveillance system in my house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since my rebirth, I had already arranged for surveillance cameras to be installed around my house. And these cameras were connected to my phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If any abnormal situation occurred, the surveillance system would alert me immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the alarm, I hurriedly took out my phone and opened the live feed from the surveillance cameras in my house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my horror, I saw several burly men breaking into my living room. And the bodyguard Quinn hired to protect my mom was now standing firmly in front of her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was alone facing these burly men. They all had tattoos on their shoulders, indicating they were not good people. I feared that the bodyguard wouldn't stand a chance against them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Jade had started to target my mom!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched with a pounding heart and immediately ended the meeting. Without hesitation, I rushed downstairs and drove home at full speed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I called Quinn immediately. But the background noise on his end sounded chaotic. He was probably at his club. "Quinn, someone has broken into my house! My mom is in danger! Please, help me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Who's so bold, disregarding the law?" Quinn sounded startled when he heard what I said.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="317.html">« Prev</a><a href="319.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
