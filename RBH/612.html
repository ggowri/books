I almost burst out laughing, but managed to hold it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott forced a smile and said, "You're right. In the past, you pleased me. Now it's my turn to please you. It's fair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, I could hold back from laughing, but Elliott's self-deprecating words made me unable to resist and burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me smile, Elliott finally breathed a sigh of relief. He reached out his hand and pinched my round face, which had become plump due to pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was the baby well-behaved? Did he bully you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had just relaxed. Elliott's words made me tense again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at my belly, looking like a kind father. Looking at him, I didn't know what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I decided to keep this child, I swore never to let this child go back to the Bryant family, and I wouldn't let the Bryant family know that this child was a member of the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott already believed that the child in my belly was his child, so he asked me with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't let him think like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bryant family would do whatever they wanted to do to me. Thinking about this, I felt that I couldn't forgive them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly regained my indifference and said with a bad attitude, "You don't need to worry. Quinn takes care of me and the baby meticulously. If you have that kind of free time, care more about your and Giselle's kids."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't understand and took a step closer to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn was my friend. He was supposed to help me take care of you and the child. Madeline, don't deny it anymore. I have thought over and over again that this child must be ours. He is our surprise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Elliott to be so magnanimous. When I mentioned Quinn, he didn't get angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was certain that the child in my belly was his. This was not a good sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed his hand away and retorted coldly, "Elliott, you're wrong. The child in my belly is Quinn's. We have met each other's parents and are getting married soon. How could I possibly keep a child for a man who betrayed me? You're overthinking! Besides, Giselle has already given birth to a son for you. Your grandfather and parents must be pleased. You don't need to worry about this child in my belly that doesn't belong to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott withdrew his hand dejectedly. He looked at me gloomily, with a hint of doubt flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that true? We got along well when you were pregnant. Are you saying that you had already betrayed me back then? Madeline, I don't believe..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you suspect me and Quinn back then? Well, now I admit that we had been together for a while. I was so close to you to retaliate against your disdain towards me. I didn't want you to be with Giselle. I have always loved Quinn. We had been together for a long time. Otherwise, why would Quinn treat me so well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew my words would upset Elliott, but I still deliberately said them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, the depression in his eyes turned into anger. He grabbed my neck, pushing me towards the window behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? Madeline, is what you said true?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="611.html">« Prev</a><a href="613.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
