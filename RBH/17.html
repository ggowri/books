After enjoying a hearty meal with them, I went back to my room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would rather sleep on this princess bed that had accompanied me since I was little rather than the marriage bed in Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay on the bed, holding a pen and focusing on studying the materials about Glory Group's core business that my dad had given me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's disdainful words were still lingering in my mind. I didn't want to be a useless eye candy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was going to work at Glory Group, preparing to officially take over Glory Group in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was studying the materials attentively when the phone suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I picked up the phone and saw the word "Elliott", I was almost jaw-dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was actually calling me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I answered the phone suspiciously. His lazy and charming voice sounded on the other end of the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, where are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from his tone, it seemed like he had returned to Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't I tell you? I have to go to work next, so it's more convenient for me to stay at my parents' house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you playing the career woman game?" Elliott continued to mock me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Considering your recent performance, I have reason to suspect that you have taken some master class and been brainwashed by someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but smile bitterly in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't the tragic experience in my previous life enough? What master class could be more instructive than firsthand experience?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When taught by others, one might not understand. When taught by things, one could instantly learn his lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think whatever you want. Anyway, no matter what I do and how I do it, you won't approve of it, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but retort him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, however, let out a cold snort on the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I heard from Milo that you called him today. I warn you. I don't care if you work at Glory Group, but don't consider yourself as Mrs. Bryant and interfere in the Bryant Group's affairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's words were so provoking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Does he really think that I am so eager to be Mrs. Bryant? Come on. Stop flattering himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rolled my eyes, but unfortunately, he couldn't see it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're overthinking it. I was just introducing a supplier to him, trying to save some money for the Bryant Group. Don't worry. I'd rather be the heiress of Glory Group than Mrs. Bryant who has to constantly please you. As for Mrs. Bryant, you can marry whoever you want. I can make way anytime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My tone was very serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to let this arrogant man know that I didn't care about his money and power. Most importantly, I didn't care about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that Elliott was once again infuriated by me. Even over the phone, I could hear the sound of something breaking once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, stop using divorce as a threat against me. Do you really think I care about this marriage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice sounded somewhat fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, whether you care or not, it doesn't matter. Anyway, as long as you want to get a divorce, you can do it anytime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spoke calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my previous life, he would often bring up divorce, which always angered me. Now, our roles had reversed, and it actually felt great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I am not a pawn to be manipulated by you. Now that you want to divorce me, I will never agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder he was the famous domineering CEO in Hoswich City. Even his logic was exceptionally overbearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to think that if I was willing to give up, I would be able to easily end this marriage. However, unexpectedly, he stubbornly refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sneered inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Suit yourself. I don't care. Mr. Bryant, it's getting late. I'm going to bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tomorrow morning I had to go to work at Glory Group. I casually brushed off Elliott and didn't bother about how he would react. I directly hung up the phone and went to sleep.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="16.html">« Prev</a><a href="18.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
