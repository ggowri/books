The breaking of the amniotic fluid is the most dangerous signal before giving birth because once the amniotic fluid is drained, the baby inside the womb will lack oxygen, and I must immediately go to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, not only are we at the border, but we are also being controlled by someone. Dehan's people still haven't arrived until now. Thinking about this, I broke out in a cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Where did this water come from? Madeline, what trick are you playing again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood still in place and even left a puddle of water. Jade saw it and questioned me suspiciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never given birth before, so she didn't know it was her water breaking. Jane immediately realized what was happening and shouted anxiously,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers' water broke! She is about to give birth to a baby soon! Hurry and take her to the hospital! Regardless of any resentment you may have with Ms. Mayers, the baby in her belly is innocent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through our conversation, it was evident that Jane had already guessed that Jade and I had once harbored resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing her words, Jade once again carefully scrutinized me from head to toe. </span><span>Subsequently, her expression immediately became very peculiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, to be honest, is the father of your child Elliott or Quinn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through her malicious gaze, I could feel that she was thinking of something wicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this place, I found myself in such a situation again, and no matter what, I could no longer rely on Dehan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to ensure the safety of myself, the children, and Jane, I had to rely on my understanding of Jade to persuade her to take me to the nearby hospital first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade and I grew up together since we were young. I knew she loved money a lot, and she went to great lengths to deceive me into coming here, all for the sake of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I immediately said to her,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It doesn't matter who the father of the child in my belly is, as long as you take me to the hospital now and let me safely give birth to this child. I promise you any conditions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade sneered,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Promise me anything? What if I ask you to give me all the shares of Glory Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very greedy. She had already fallen to this point, yet she still thought about owning shares in Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was originally expelled from the family and came to Mexico full of resentment, but still harbored hatred for not having control over the Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Glory Group was not only important to my family, but also a reward for my father's hard work. After all the effort I put into getting rid of her and her father, how could I possibly agree to her request?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides this, I could promise you anything, as long as you let me and the baby, along with my companion, go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I endured waves of pain and said to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, were you too naive? Did you think I would spare you and the bastard in your belly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Jade to be not attracted at all. After a brief pause of a few minutes, she once again signaled to her subordinates, and then she said fiercely,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never mind the mixed breed in her belly, let's take them on the back road first, and we'll deal with her when we get to Mexico!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade made a gesture, and her two subordinates immediately stepped forward again. They didn't care about my well-being at all and directly dragged both of my arms, pulling me toward the direction of the hillside.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="745.html">« Prev</a><a href="747.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
