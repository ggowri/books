Once upon a time, this song was my favorite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In college, I once gave Elliott a black sweater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That sweater was knitted stitch by stitch by me with clumsy hands. While knitting, I had fantasies in my mind about how handsome he would look wearing the black sweater, so incredibly cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when that day I held the knitted sweater I had finished and devoutly handed it to him, he didn't even glance at it, turned his head right in front of me, and threw it directly into the trash can.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the finished product that I had spent a whole month staying up all night for, unraveling and knitting, knitting and unraveling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even back then, he had already started trampling on my sincerity, and it continued until we got married. He has always treated me like this, as if he were a god, bestowing his every move and action as a favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to be really foolish, really.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to this song again, I didn't feel any sweetness at all. On the contrary, tears unknowingly slipped from my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I immediately wiped it away, desperately suppressing my emotions, not for anything else, but simply because I never wanted Elliott to see any trace of my distress again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car quickly stopped at a high-end clothing store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I got out of the car, entered the store, and the shop assistant immediately greeted him warmly. However, when they saw me, they clearly hesitated for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, I was not the female companion that Elliott often brought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shop assistant warmly greeted us at the door, and I had an embarrassed yet polite smile on my face as I accompanied Elliott to the VIP exclusive fitting room upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, like a regular customer, naturally and lazily sat on the luxurious sofa. He said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The dresses here are all new styles of this year. Choose one yourself, try it on, and let me have a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wouldn't many women like the demeanor of this wealthy person?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the legitimate wife, I was still experiencing this kind of treatment for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh, perhaps because I had been humble for too long, to the point that Elliott had long forgotten,that I am not Cinderella, I am also a true heiress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clothes here, I could afford them and didn't need his charity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, I don't like any of the clothes here. Could you please bring me the dress I ordered two weeks ago? I want to try it on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to deal with Elliott's attitude, so I spoke directly to the shop assistant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The dress you ordered? You must be Ms. Mayers, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shop assistant, upon hearing what I said, immediately asked in surprise and quickly regained composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, two weeks ago I ordered a globally limited edition dress, and the day before yesterday your store clerk notified me that it had arrived. Today happened to be when my husband was around, so I tried it on to show him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't need Elliott to take me to buy any dress at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had already paid a deposit of two million dollars a long time ago, asking this store to purchase a globally limited edition evening gown for me. That evening gown was created by the most famous designer, and there is only one in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shop assistant probably never imagined that I would be their store's mysterious big customer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was even more shocked when she heard me say "husband". Perhaps, she thought I was just Elliott's mistress, but she never imagined that I would be his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That dress was really precious. We couldn't afford to lose even a single diamond from it. We didn't realize you were Ms. Mayers. We have been keeping that dress separately. Please wait, I will have our staff bring the dress right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shop assistant was extremely humble at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I, with a proud expression on my face, crossed my arms and nodded slightly, then turned my gaze towards Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, sitting on the couch at this moment, was no longer in the proud posture he had when he first entered. He was resting his chin on one hand, and his deep eyes were fixed on me, rapidly changing their expression. The facial expression that was once high and godlike, was now visibly sinking, sinking further and further...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="40.html">« Prev</a><a href="42.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
