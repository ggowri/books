The weightlessness I just felt made me a little dazed for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? I'm still sick, haven't even brushed my teeth..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt embarrassed and annoyed, never expecting Elliott to suddenly do this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott held my face, his eyes full of tenderness. His thumb pressed beneath my eyelids, in the dim light of the ward, his deep eyes were affectionate and filled with desire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does it matter? I like it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never thought this man I once thought was unattainable and superior was actually such a romantic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still clung to his clothes, my breath not completely calming down, my face red, and gasping.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just threw up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't mind." Elliott reached to tuck my hair behind my ear, his fingers sliding into my soft and smooth hair. "If you weren't sick, I'd want to..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't finish his sentence, but I instantly understood what he meant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could speak, he suddenly pulled down my neckline, pressing his head against my chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was in the hospital, where the ward's door couldn't even be locked!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was anxious and embarrassed, trying instinctively to push him away. However, under the influence of desire, he was completely uncontrollable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warmth from his palm directly reached my heart through my skin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought we could only have a calm conversation between us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now I realized that once there was intimacy between a man and a woman, it was like opening Pandora's box, not suitable for being alone together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, given the chance to be alone, desires would emerge.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're mine. Don't push me away again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott finally lifted his head from my chest. He held my face, looking at me, then kissed my lips again, deeply and tenderly, as if trying to take back all the emotions I had poured out on him earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I silently enjoyed this sex, feeling a mix of emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to push him away, but he was engrossed, almost forgetting time and place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white light above us was like a thin veil, wrapping us together...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've made a mistake again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stroked my back. He held me, leaning against the headboard, breathing slightly heavily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You still remember?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My face flushed, rationality gradually awakening. Thinking about everything that just happened, I felt more and more ashamed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was getting bolder, actually forcing me to have sex in the hospital room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But your complexion has improved a lot. Looks like I'm more effective than the hospital's IV drip."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stared at my face, half smiling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I now realized he could be so bad, so rogue. I used to think of him as an untouchable deity.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="375.html">« Prev</a><a href="377.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
