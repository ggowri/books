If there is any need later, I will tell you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't realize anything was wrong. But obviously my words offended him again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I still have a meeting to hold, so I'll leave first. Lily, take care of yourself and call me if you need anything."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if being greatly hurt, Elliott turned around and left in strides with Barry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot came and went like a gust of wind. I looked at his back, feeling a little anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew he seemed to have misunderstood me. But I didn't know how to explain it. I could only stare blankly as his back disappeared from my sight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott seem to care more about you now than before. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade came to me, pretended to be intimate with me, held my hand, and whispered in my ear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Elliott had married me, there had always been a distance between us in the past. So he didn't have much contact with my family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jade, aren't you busy with the company?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly changed the topic, turned around, and asked tentatively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I not be busy? In addition to your project, the company also has several big projects in progress. Many things are waiting for Mr. Mayers' decision. I didn't expect such an accident to happen to Mr. Mayers at this time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade sighed and said melancholy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll come to the company tomorrow to take a look. Let's call the shareholders and senior management to gather tomorrow to discuss the next steps."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad was still in a coma, so I had to prepare for a lot of things in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Jade rejected me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you should just stay in the hospital and take care of Mr. Mayers with your mother. Leave the company's affairs to me. I have already informed that an emergency meeting will be held tomorrow. Everyone will elect someone to be the assistant to the chairman during the period when Mr. Mayers is unconscious and will take over the Glory Group's matters temporarily."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was thinking about the same thing as me. But what she meant was that she didn't want me to get involved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She did not let me participate. Could it be that she wanted to seize power while my father was critically ill?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart sank for a moment, and I shook my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this case, I must attend the meeting tomorrow. Although I had no power in the Glory Group, my dad is the Glory Group's founder and largest shareholder. He is in a coma now, so as his only daughter, I must be involved in the Glory Group's management. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was taken aback by my dominating tone, smiled, and said,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, Madeline, you haven't dealt with any company affairs for so many years. I'm afraid that even if you participate, you won't understand anything. Besides, you never cared about the Glory Group, so why are you... "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because I didn't care about the company in the past, they took advantage of the loopholes in my family, which eventually led to our family being ruined.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I cursed in my heart, but said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The past is the past. Now I want to participate. And during this period, I also learned a lot. What? Don't you want me to attend the meeting tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade's face was already very stiff at this time, but she forced out a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way. The Glory Group belongs to your family. Of course, it's okay for you to participate. Okay, the meeting starts at nine o'clock tomorrow, you should come over early then. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll be there on time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="297.html">« Prev</a><a href="299.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
