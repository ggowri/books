It doesn't matter. To me, you're what matters most."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't give a damn. With a nonchalant smile, he surprisingly pulled up a business proposal on his phone and slid it across to me, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the blueprint for Bryant Group's next three years, the top-secret file of the company. Feel free to peruse it, Madeline, if you're interested."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's level of composure took me by surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To convince me of his promise, he was even willing to share something as confidential as this with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but feel a bit moved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, I didn't even glance at his business proposal. Instead, I shut off his phone screen. I looked at him and said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I can sense your complete trust in me right now. But honestly, I don't need to know all this. It's actually quite fun to be rivals with the Bryant Group. If I knew your next move in advance, even if I won, it would take all the fun out of it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott instantly grasped the meaning in my words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than him spilling the beans about Bryant Group's business plan, I'd prefer to be his business rival.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gradual success in the business realm over the past few years has allowed me to savor the taste of accomplishment from my career.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I relish the sensation of Glory Group's steady ascent on the wealth charts. More than that, I yearn for the day when, armed with my own abilities and the strength of Glory Group, we topple Bryant Group and ascend to the pinnacle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This feeling really gets my blood pumping.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of knowing all the plans of the Bryant Group in advance, which is akin to having the answers to a test beforehand, it takes away the thrill of the game between us. It's no fun at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, my Madeline is an ambitious little lady after all. It's my fault for not understanding you enough before, leaving you without the chance to showcase your talents for so long."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gently caressed my face, tears welling up in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his words, I could clearly hear his regret for treating me so coldly in the past.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze, speechless for a good while, a surge of tears threatening to spill.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is the "understanding" that my heart has longed for, yet always seemed just out of reach.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's dig into the noodles first, they won't taste as good once they've cooled down."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I bowed my head, using the act of eating noodles as a cover for the turmoil within.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your spaghetti is still the best. I've been craving this taste for a long time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a bite, Elliott gave a thumbs-up in praise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Feel free to eat more if you find it tasty. You can't have food with strong flavors right now, so I've made the meat sauce a bit milder than usual."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My tone involuntarily softened considerably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The noodles you made are just like you, perfectly done. Almost forgot, I bought you a set of clothes, let me fetch it for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott polished off a plate of noodles in no time. Wiping his mouth, he sprang up as if suddenly remembering something, and darted off to the cloakroom upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, he descended the stairs, a gift bag in hand, and presented it to me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="848.html">« Prev</a><a href="850.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
