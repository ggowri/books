How could you say those things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just didn't want you to sleep there alone. Carthage is at the foot of the mountain, and it's much colder than Hoswich. You can sleep peacefully next to me. I've got a high body temperature. Don't worry, I won't do anything to you," Quinn reassured me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the bed was narrow, Quinn carefully maintained a distance from me, not a bit of skin touching my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, as Quinn had said, it was warm under the covers. I lay on my side at the edge of the bed while Quinn lay flat. Hearing his steady and robust breathing, I didn't feel as scared anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What you said earlier wasn't true, right?" I asked skeptically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silly, I was just messing with you. It's not as scary as I made it sound. The fifth floor is quiet because it's the administrative office. Only this room is specifically used as a ward. The People's Hospital of Carthage is so small. How could it have an anatomy room?" Quinn explained with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing him say that, I finally felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of dripping water continued, incredibly eerie in the late night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, lying beside Quinn, I no longer felt scared. I must admit that he gave me a tremendous sense of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, I drifted off to sleep again, this time sleeping soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I woke up to bright light streaming through the window, realizing I must have slept for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was still fast asleep, not only deeply but also with a flushed face, emitting a comforting warmth that I could feel even from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I got up from the bed and stretched, but I couldn't bring myself to wake him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had intended to call Adam and ask him to bring some breakfast, but suddenly, I saw Quinn furrow his brow, followed by a groan of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn? Quinn?" I called out his name, but he didn't respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt something seemed off. His face was unusually red. Quickly, I reached out and touched his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my horror, Quinn's forehead was burning up, scarily hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident he was running a high fever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged, and I rushed into the corridor, shouting, "Doctor! Is there a doctor around? Anyone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My cries caught the attention of a doctor who emerged from one of the offices. He approached me and asked, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, do you have a thermometer? Please, help him. He seems to have a high fever!" I grabbed the doctor's arm, my voice trembling with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor became alarmed. He quickly fetched a thermometer and took Quinn's temperature, discovering it had spiked to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got to bring down his temperature fast. He's still recovering from injuries, and if the fever worsens, it could have serious consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor fretted, immediately summoning his colleague to assist. They hurriedly started physically cooling Quinn down and prepared to administer antibiotics to reduce inflammation.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="515.html">« Prev</a><a href="517.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
