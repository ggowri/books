Soon, he disappeared at my doorstep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared blankly in the direction he disappeared. For a moment, there was some confusion in my heart. But more than that, there was a sense of touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is hard to imagine that I actually received understanding from the man who used to despise me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom appeared behind me at some point. She was holding a watering can in her hand. Perhaps she had just been watering the flowers in the yard. She asked me softly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, who was that person just now? Why haven't I seen you interacting with him before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, that was one of my friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, he looked pretty good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom muttered a sentence. And when I heard her comment, I couldn't help but laugh immediately. So, I deliberately teased her by saying:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what's so good about him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom also laughed. She reached out and lovingly touched my face, saying:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as they were your friends, I thought they were all right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom was always like this. From childhood to adulthood, she always went along with me, following my lead. She never stopped me from doing what I wanted to do. Moreover, she never interfered with the friends I wanted to make.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I increasingly feel the value of family. So, I couldn't help but throw myself into my mother's arms. I increasingly realized that I was so happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter with you being all dirty? Go back and take a shower right away. You're so grown up, why do you still act like a wild girl?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, my mother smelled the scent of seawater on me. She immediately started scolding me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ran into the room with a smile on my face. I took a refreshing shower in the bathroom. Afterward, I enjoyed a delicious dinner cooked by my mom. Because I was too exhausted, I quickly fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Do Not Love project team has been preparing for quite some time. Next, the team will enter the casting stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I arrived at the company early in the morning, Adam immediately brought over a stack of documents for me to choose from. He said that the documents were all intended for auditioning for the female lead in "Do Not Love".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was looking through the documents one by one. Adam was standing beside me. Suddenly, he asked me with concern:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, did you not get enough rest last night? Why do you look so pale?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a mirror and looked at myself. Indeed, my lips and complexion were a bit pale. It could be because of the exhaustion I have been experiencing lately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to make matters worse, my period suddenly arrived this morning. So, I was indeed feeling a bit weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you were definitely overworked. Plus, you didn't get much rest either. How about this, let me go through and filter it for you first... You take a break for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Adam finished speaking, he immediately picked up the documents and started flipping through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His small gesture warmed my heart. I looked up at him and he was smiling at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was truly a college graduate who had just graduated. The way he smiled was like a gentle breeze brushing against my face. His smile instantly lifted my mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, you are so attentive. There must have been many girls who liked you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I joked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were girls who liked me, but they were not the type I liked. Madeline, I like your mature type. Unfortunately, you are already married, otherwise I would definitely pursue you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was very straightforward. And his words made me laugh:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had never heard before that someone liked my type."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women are probably naturally inclined to enjoy being praised, especially compliments from the opposite sex. Moreover, it seemed like the first time I had heard someone's compliments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the beginning of my infatuation, I only liked Elliott. I focused all my attention on him. As a result, I ignored everyone else around me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My youth faded away, leaving only Elliott's figure in the distance. Later, I hurriedly entered into marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have never experienced the feeling of being cared for by the opposite sex. I have also never enjoyed compliments from the opposite sex. I have never felt pursued or flattered by the opposite sex. Therefore, under Elliott's long-term suppression, I increasingly feel inferior. I feel unworthy, undeserving.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="69.html">« Prev</a><a href="71.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
