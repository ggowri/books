I've worked hard. Are you sure you want to fire me? Don't forget, your father is now in a vegetative state. Without my help, with just you, do you think you can manage Glory Group properly without making mistakes?" Jade yelled angrily over the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without you, perhaps Glory Group would have thrived even more. My father promoted you to your current position because he considered you his niece. It wasn't you who made Glory Group successful; it was Glory Group that made you successful." I said coldly into the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want now? Do you want me to come to you right now? After all, we're sisters. Let's discuss this properly, okay?" Jade suddenly sounded a bit nervous. She probably knew that once I started investigating the past financial mess, I would surely find evidence of her embezzlement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once this evidence was exposed, not only my father and I, but also several shareholders who had once been friendly with her, wouldn't spare her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing to discuss. I've already informed all the shareholders. Tonight, I will settle the past financial mess with you." I said coldly into the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade sounded visibly panicked on the other end of the line. "Madeline, are you really sure you want to do this? I'm your cousin. And those projects really did end up losing money. How about this, don't convene all the shareholders yet. Let's meet and talk somewhere, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's too late. Since you targeted me and my father, you should have expected this day to come. If you cared about family ties, I wouldn't have been so ruthless. But now, don't blame me for being heartless." I said coldly before hanging up the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade... the woman who made me endure the pain of losing my family in the previous life. Tonight, I'm going to ruin her completely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I started the car and slammed on the gas pedal, heading firmly in the direction of Glory Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, memories of my parents' miserable lives in my previous life involuntarily flashed through my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't forget my father kneeling outside the Glory Group building, tears silently streaming down his face as he pleaded, only to be driven away by security like a stray dog.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't forget my mother being surrounded by creditors, tied to a chair, and humiliated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I couldn't forget the day my father tragically died, with goose feather-sized snowflakes falling from the sky.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nor could I forget how my mother, in the end, was forced to work as a nurse in the hospital to make money, enduring Nicole's relentless insults and abuse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Good people don't always get what they deserve, do they?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had experienced the harsh realities of society to the fullest in my previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, I would not show mercy to anyone. I would seek revenge on everyone who had ever hurt me, tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I drove all the way to the foot of the Glory Group building.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I arrived at the conference room, the shareholders were already present.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="316.html">« Prev</a><a href="318.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
