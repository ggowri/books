How did you end up being with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should ask yourself as a man, is it appropriate to leave your woman on the road in the middle of the night? Have you ever thought that she might encounter danger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn kept yelling into the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice instantly became even more indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Answer my question first. Where are you now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn snorted coldly and continued speaking into the phone, "You should seriously reflect on what I said, Elliott. If you love her, treat her well. But if you don't love her, please don't hurt her. If you can't treat your woman with kindness, you should let her go. There are plenty of men waiting to love and cherish her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn! Don't you think this was none of your business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Elliott was extremely dissatisfied with Quinn's attitude towards him, so he had already been on the verge of rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she hadn't met me that night, she would have fallen into the hands of a few thugs again. Elliott, you should be grateful that I am here. Otherwise, you would regret it for the rest of your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Quinn finished speaking, without waiting for Elliott to say anything else, he hung up the phone directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Quinn stand up for me and risk offending Elliott, his former best friend, I couldn't help but feel even more guilty in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I will handle my own affairs. You have been friends for so many years, and I don't want to cause any discord between you because of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. If he gets mad at me for such a small matter, he doesn't deserve to be my friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn shook his head, looking indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him, not knowing what to say for a moment, and at that moment, my phone screen lit up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was clearly infuriated. He sent another text message, which contained only one line of highly threatening words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott: "Send me your location, or I will call the police."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ignored his message directly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, any man who cared even the slightest bit about my safety would not have abandoned me halfway, and this was already the second time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Are these things not enough to wake me up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was actually still occasionally deceived by his kindness, and I almost fell back into that emotional whirlpool that I once couldn't extricate myself from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head. Thinking about my behavior in the car tonight and how I went crazy like a madman after jumping out, I increasingly felt that my sudden loss of control was truly baffling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was obviously hungry, and he devoured several pieces of grilled ribs and some other seafood barbecue. Meanwhile, I hardly ate anything because I wasn't very hungry and I didn't have the habit of eating supper at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished eating with him, he stood up again and carried me on his back, ready to take me home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to carry me to the car, I suddenly saw Elliott's Kuri Nan parked right at the entrance. Moreover, it was parked behind Quinn's SUV.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="132.html">« Prev</a><a href="134.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
