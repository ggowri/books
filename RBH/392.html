If Giselle wasn't pregnant, I'd have marched over, grabbed her by the hair, and hit her ages ago.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle stood there, all innocent-looking, with her hands clasped. "Hey, we didn't knock over that hot water bottle and cup. Your mom was the one who couldn't keep a grip. And those flowers? They were meant for your dad. I was just trying to be nice. But your mom flipped and trashed them. Heard she found out I'm expecting Elliott's baby and wanted to make a scene. So, I had to teach her a lesson through a bodyguard."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lesson? What the heck did she do to my mom?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I heard that, my blood ran cold, and I darted to my mom's side, helping her up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I noticed this big red mark on her face and bruises on her hands, blood at the corners of her mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom never faced violence in her cushy life, especially not from my dad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here was Giselle, with her beefy bodyguards, attacking my mom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I locked eyes with Giselle, fury bubbling over. Without a second thought, I grabbed the fruit knife from the table and rushed straight toward her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so mad, I couldn't even find the words to express it, and all the logic in my head just vanished in a blink.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories from my previous life flooded in, like a movie reel playing in my mind. I couldn't shake off the image of her throwing me into the sea with that brute, and the anger just kept boiling up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was prepared for this confrontation, while I was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw me charging at her with a knife, she freaked out and hid behind her bodyguard. He swooped in, snatched the knife from my hand, and tossed it aside before pinning me down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fought back as hard as I could, but those guys were like brick walls. I was totally outmatched.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline! "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom rushed over, panicked, but the bodyguard shoved her hard, and she went crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It ripped me apart seeing her fall like that, and my hatred blazed even hotter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I cursed myself for not putting up a better fight and for agreeing to transfer my dad here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I hadn't, my mom wouldn't have to swallow this humiliation from Giselle today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle piped up, all smug, saying, "Madeline, Laura Bryant's calling the shots. She's saying it's over between the Bryant and Mayers. Wants you to stop milking the Bryant family and divorce Elliott, or else they're pulling the plug on our partnership. Without their parts, our latest Glory Group batch is toast. So, think fast."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="391.html">« Prev</a><a href="393.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
