You must bring the money within one day, remember, you can only come alone. If I find out that you have called the police or brought someone with you, I will kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Quinn really kidnapped?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My whole body's blood froze in an instant, and my first thought was, this is impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, who has always been accustomed to traveling alone around the world, had a wealth of experience and a wide social circle, with friends all over the world. How could someone like him possibly be kidnapped?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My first thought was not to believe her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately said, "I don't believe it! I heard that there are many scammers in the border area of Norch City. You wouldn't be one of those scamming gangs trying to deceive me, would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you believe it?" the voice on the phone laughed wickedly, "You can add me on WhatsApp and see him with your own eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hung up the phone after she finished speaking, and soon after, she added me on WhatsApp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sleepiness that I still had lingering moments ago has completely dissipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at the phone screen intently, praying that all of this wouldn't be true. But soon enough, she actually sent a video, and just as I had opened it, I was almost scared enough by the horrifying scene inside to throw away the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the video, a man was locked in a water dungeon made entirely of wooden circles. Except for his head, all other parts of his body were immersed in extremely dirty water. I could clearly see snakes, leeches, and grasshoppers in the water... In short, it was very filthy and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's face had been beaten to a pulp, and through the video, I couldn't see his face clearly at all, nor could I identify who he was. However, I did notice the wristwatch on his bound arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That watch indeed belonged to Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an extremely valuable wristwatch, passed down from the ancestors of the Woods family. Quinn had proudly told me that this watch was one of a kind in the </span><span>world, a unique piece, so he always wore it wherever he went, even when he slept, he never took it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is the man who was locked in the water dungeon really Quinn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart instantly rose to my throat, and I instinctively covered my chest, unbelievably watching everything in the video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, the hoarse female voice in the video reappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, your crush doesn't believe that I kidnapped you. I have no choice but to show her your miserable state. Whether you can survive or not depends on whether she has a conscience toward you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the woman finished speaking, a long whip suddenly fell down and fiercely struck the man's hand exposed outside the water dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man let out an extremely painful scream instantly, desperately struggling in the water dungeon, with his facial expression twisted in extreme agony. I watched the video repeatedly, trying to see clearly who he was, but I still couldn't confirm if he was Quinn until he suddenly shouted in extreme pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, please don't come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was extremely weak, yet it seemed to have used up all his strength. Despite his hoarse voice, it was indeed Quinn's tone and intonation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt as if my heart was instantly split open by a lightning bolt, causing immense pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately dialed the woman's phone number. As soon as the call was connected, I couldn't suppress the excitement in my heart and started shouting at her crazily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the fuck are you? What did you do to Quinn? Why did you treat him like this? What do you want?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="725.html">« Prev</a><a href="727.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
