You don't have to be shy. Just think of me as a nurse from this hospital," I said, stepping forward and immediately putting Quinn's arm over my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's body clearly hadn't recovered as well as he claimed. After a few steps together, I noticed sweat on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is your wound hurting a lot? Can you manage to walk?" I couldn't help but ask worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. It's just a little pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn pretended to be nonchalant, but each step he took seemed heavy. However, he tried not to shift his weight onto me to lessen the pressure on my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him endure the pain made my heart ache even more. I supported him step by step until we reached the entrance of the men's restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me at the door. I'll go in by myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn gestured for me to stop. He tried to move his hand from my shoulder and attempted to walk into the restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as he took a step, he nearly collapsed from the pain, swaying dangerously to one side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but cry out in alarm, rushing to support him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I instinctively looked around, hoping to find a man to assist him, but to my surprise, there wasn't a soul in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is this floor completely empty?" I asked suspiciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This floor of the hospital isn't open to the public. Dr. Muller arranged for me to be here so I can rest quietly," Quinn explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It suddenly clicked for me. No wonder the fifth floor was so quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I can't hold it anymore," Quinn blurted out, his face flushing red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately understood what he meant, and my face instantly turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to push me away again, but I was worried he might fall if I let go, so I firmly held onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll help you to the urinal. Go ahead. I won't look," I murmured with a red face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know why, but I felt like the atmosphere between Quinn and me had suddenly become extremely awkward," I said inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um... this doesn't seem quite right." Even Quinn, who usually joked around, became reserved in this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. It's an emergency. Don't worry about it. Hurry, let's go!" I urged him, seeing his face turn red with embarrassment, knowing he must be at his limit. I then helped him to the urinal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn began to undo his pants, but just then, even his pants seemed to be against us. The belt was tied into a knot that he struggled to undo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, this hospital even has crappy patient clothes..." Quinn muttered in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had already averted my gaze, but hearing him, I had to turn back with a red face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he couldn't undo the knot on his pants with just one hand, I blushed and said, "Don't move. Let me help you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="512.html">« Prev</a><a href="514.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
