On her left and right stood two women who looked like nannies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that her status in the Bryant family was getting higher. Before even the child was born, she already had two nannies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what would happen if Laura knew that Giselle was pregnant with a Down syndrome baby?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and asked her doubtfully, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her big belly, she strolled toward me under the support of the two nannies. She stood proudly in front of me and said, "I'm here to take Elliott home. By the way, you still have some personal belongings at Serenity Villa. I have packed them all for you. Do you want me to deliver them to you? Or should you go and get them yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, her tone was exceptionally polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her words were like a knife, stabbing my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you like those things very much? I can give you old clothes and my husband. Those are things that I don't like. You can just take them," I replied directly, and with just one sentence, the smile on her face froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, today is Carnival day, and I didn't want to quarrel with you. After all, you are now divorced with Elliott. I didn't expect that your words were still so full of malice. My intentions were good, and I specifically asked Sean to pack your things away," Giselle said aggrievedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your kindness. If you like those things, you can keep them. If you don't like them, just throw them away. I don't really care as I have everything at home, anyway. I'm not like you, who always covet other people's things." My tone was indifferent, but I still insisted on refuting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was not angry now. To me, whether it was Giselle or Elliott, they were all in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Confronting me, Giselle was utterly at a disadvantage. She was speechless, looking at me dumbfounded as if she didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled sarcastically, turned around, and prepared to get in the car. At that moment, I heard Giselle shout sweetly behind me, "Elliott, you finally came out. I have been standing here waiting for you for a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that intimate address, I felt my heart being tugged again. I quickly got into the car and couldn't help but glance out the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw that Giselle, who needed two persons to support her just now, was now walking swiftly toward Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held his arm affectionately, and Elliott didn't break free. He lowered his head, and after saying a few words to her, they walked side by side toward the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at their backs, I felt my heart aching again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I clutched my chest and subconsciously glanced at my belly. A feeling of bitterness and grievance suddenly surged in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam had been waiting for me in the car just now, so he must have seen the scene where Giselle and I were talking. Seeing me clutching my chest, he immediately turned his head and said, "Madeline, don't be sad. Come on, I'll take you to eat something delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly adjusted my mood, pretended that I didn't care, and said, "I'm fine. They don't deserve my tears."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is a very good dessert shop nearby. Let me take you there. I heard that eating desserts when you are in a bad mood will make you feel better." After saying that, Adam immediately started the car and drove me away from the place.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="499.html">« Prev</a><a href="501.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
