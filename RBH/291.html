His eyes seduced me and made me hot. I was just about to beg for mercy, when my phone rang.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden ringtone made the atmosphere between us disappear instantly. I picked up the phone. When I found it was from Laura, I shuddered. I met Elliott's eyes and hurriedly answered the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you to call me mom? Your grandfather was so angry that he was hospitalized because of you two. Did you know that? Elliott, why is his phone turned off? Doesn't he know that his grandfather had been rescued all night? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, Laura got angry and cursed loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Cormac's news of being rescued, Elliott and I sat up from the sofa in shock. Elliott was so panicked that he snatched the phone from my hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what did you just say? What happened to grandpa?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! You now remember to answer the phone? Why was your cell phone turned off last night? Your grandpa... If your grandpa had something wrong last night, would you feel at ease?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura heard Elliott's voice and immediately started crying and questioning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt that Elliott's body shook involuntarily when he heard this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said into the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, I'll hurry back now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott hung up the phone, turned his head, and looked at me solemnly. There was obvious guilt in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>obviously, Laura's sudden phone call made him feel depressed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, I know Cormac was important to him. Hearing that Cormac had been rescued because of us, I felt bad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly held his hand and said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, then go back quickly. Cormac's health is not good, if anything happens to him, we will both be guilty. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott responded in a deep voice, and then immediately stood up, eager to return Hoswich.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his movements, I could feel that he was concerned with Cormac.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, as Elliott's wife, I should go back with him to Hoswich city to visit Cormac, so I could make up for our oversight last night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, I stood up and immediately looked at Elliott and said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go back with you to visit Cormac. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned to look at me, but the smile on his face was a little awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go back and check the situation first. You should have a good rest first and wait until I deal with it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cormac was so angry last night that he fainted, and it must have something to do with our video.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I showed up again at this time, Cormac would hate me even more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't say it explicitly, but I already understood his concerns, so I nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott kissed on my forehead and quickly disappeared through the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere between us suddenly became cold and desolate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the kiss marks on my neck weren't still so clear, I almost doubted whether everything that happened that night was just a dream.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat on the sofa blankly, thinking about what happened last night. Elliott even missed answering the phone call from his family because of our passion, and I felt very uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott must feel guilty too, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened that video and wanted to watch it again. But I didn't expect that when I opened it again, I found that the video had been blocked.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="290.html">« Prev</a><a href="292.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
