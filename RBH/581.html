Seeing me awake, Quinn immediately smiled, "You're up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, did you sleep like that last night? That must have been tiring," I remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's nothing. Back when I used to camp in the wild, we didn't even have a couch, just had to curl up in the bushes for a while," Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the wild? What were you doing out there?" I asked skeptically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment, then quickly changed his tune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During previous outdoor camping trips, we occasionally had to sleep outside, experiencing a bit of a tough life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't realize you not only liked off-roading but also enjoyed this kind of thing." I felt surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "I like trying out all sorts of new and adventurous things, so my parents always feel like I'm an untamable wild horse, impossible to rein in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You Woods family folks are quite unique, be it you, Carole, Auntie Grey, or even your parents... each with their own distinct style," I chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The recent interactions made me truly feel that every member of the Woods family had unique characteristics. However, they all shared a common trait of openness, displaying a high level of acceptance towards people and things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like you have a soft spot for our Woods family," Quinn teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I caught the playful tone in his words and didn't hold back, playfully punching his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, don't tease me. We both know it's just banter between us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn stood up, stretched lazily, and then affectionately ruffled my hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, I'm fine with it. With me, you have the freedom to choose. I just want you to be happy. Whatever role I play, I can meet your needs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's words clearly conveyed that all his decisions were based on my happiness, with his own desires taking a back seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one's lifetime, apart from one's parents, rarely did someone treat another so unconditionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but ask myself again, "What exceptional qualities do I possess that allow Quinn to treat me this way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't dwell on it. Perhaps one day, you'll meet a girl who truly captivates you, and then you'll spend a lifetime together," I said solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It won't happen again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Quinn expressed it with such firmness and certainty, as if he had closed off all possibilities for his future, leaving no room for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at Quinn, I increasingly felt that a huge enigma lay hidden within him, an answer I had yet to uncover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's words echoed in my mind. "Quinn isn't a good person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't understand why Elliott said that, and Quinn, although seemingly deeply affectionate towards me, always maintained a certain distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "The heart of a man is truly elusive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling perplexed, I decided not to dwell on it any longer. After all, I had many important things to attend to.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="580.html">« Prev</a><a href="582.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
