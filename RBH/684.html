Despite her quick movement, I still caught a glimpse of that fleeting action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn noticed something was amiss and quickly supported me, asking me with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing, I accidentally tripped. It's fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did not speak out, but said it with a little disguise. Afterward, I sat down with Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zara's original position was supposed to be on my left side. It seems that she originally intended to reserve this spot for Quinn, but she didn't expect that Quinn would be the first to let me sit in this position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I sat down, I saw her pouting discontentedly. Then, she stood up directly and walked past me, sitting in the empty seat on the other side of Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, she was far away from the center and might not be able to reach the dishes on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zara, why are you sitting so far away? Come sit with us. You're grown up now. You can't cling to Quinn like you did when you were little, especially since Quinn has a girlfriend now. Be obedient, come over here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nina smiled and gestured to Zara to come and sit with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He had a girlfriend. Does that mean he couldn't talk to his own sister? I believe Madeline wouldn't be so petty, and besides, I was the one who first met Quinn. Madeline, don't you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zara blinked her eyes at me innocently. Her voice was high-pitched and crisp, but not to the point of making one feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, such a girl indeed easily arouses a man's desire to protect. Moreover, it can be seen that although she is not Nina and August's biological child, it is evident from their attitude that they treat Zara extremely well, even better than their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little princess, who was brought up in a sheltered environment, had a naturally pure and innocent personality, just like the old me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Zara, I saw my former self, especially when she looked at Quinn, the sparkle in her eyes, almost identical to how I used to look at Elliott back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I didn't show up, given this girl's clingy ability, it's hard to guarantee that Quinn wouldn't be attracted to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they grew up together, so no matter how you look at it, they should be a compatible couple. On the contrary, I may not be suitable for Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, since you rarely come back to the country, let Quinn take you around and show </span><span>you the sights."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said to her with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zara, Madeline, being generous doesn't mean we can overstep boundaries. You're twenty now, not a little girl anymore. Come here quickly, don't be so rude and let others make fun of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I finished speaking, August pretended to be serious and said. But his eyes still showed a strong affection for Zara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you guys. I rarely come back, and you won't even let me get close to Quinn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zara muttered. Despite being extremely unwilling, she still walked over and sat in between her mom and dad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will be in Hoswich city next. Are you afraid of not having a chance to get close to Quinn? Stop bothering Quinn now. Madeline is pregnant, so Quinn needs to spend more time taking care of her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole's tone carried a hint of impatience. She frowned. I sensed that she seemed to dislike Zara, but I didn't know the reason behind it.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="683.html">« Prev</a><a href="685.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
