Ms. Mayers, to put it bluntly, given his current level of dependence on you, it's certain that the best treatment outcome will be achieved if you work with him on his therapy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack looked at me and said bluntly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Jack's words, I felt a ripple of anxiety:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you're saying his memory is stuck before our divorce, and I'm supposed to play along like we're still married. Dr. Jones, I'm sorry, but there's no way I can do that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing my refusal, Jack said with a crestfallen expression:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, if you force him to face reality without his cooperation, I fear it might trigger a nerve shock. This could lead to a clot blockage causing a stroke, which could be life-threatening."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I initially came to the hospital to care for him, driven by a spirit of humanity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I plan to leave the moment he wakes up, severing all ties with him forever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Jack's words have put me in a real pickle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wants me to stick around, to play the part of a sweet couple even though we've already broken up. It's honestly quite tough for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if I don't cooperate and he learns the truth, what if he really has a stroke, an accident? I'd be plagued with guilt for the rest of my life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he got hurt because of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me mull it over, Dr. Jones."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found myself at a loss for words. Seeing this, Jack gave my shoulder a reassuring pat:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry to put you in a tough spot, Ms. Mayers."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wrapping up my chat with Jack, I headed back to the ward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had already had Barry pack up. The moment I showed up, he couldn't wait to approach me. His deep-set eyes, from the moment I appeared, never left me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What took you so long?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took my hand, cupped my chin, and leaned in, intending to steal a kiss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a frantic rush, I thrust my hand out to push him away:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, mind your manners, this is a hospital."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, not a care in the world, still looking at me with a gaze full of affection:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to just make an impact, I want to amplify it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't mince his words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could even react, he covered my mouth with a swiftness that was as sudden as a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his tongue brushed against my lips, I was caught off guard, flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively jerked my face from side to side, but there was no escaping him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His kiss was dominant and overbearing, leaving me no room to breathe. His hand hooked around the back of my head, leaving me with no escape, no place to hide.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood there, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kiss was deep, lingering. Each second felt like an eternity, as if a century had passed in its wake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until I nearly suffocated, biting down hard on his tongue, that Elliott finally let me go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stumbled back a few paces. Clutching my nearly swollen-kissed lips, I bellowed:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, have you lost your mind? What the hell are you doing, you bastard? Did you even bother to ask for my consent?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="778.html">« Prev</a><a href="780.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
