No matter how high or powerful a person is, once taken to that place, they will suffer greatly and it will be difficult to come back alive. Quinn is such a wise and brave person, why would he suddenly be kidnapped by such extremist elements?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam spoke slowly, and his words made my heart even more anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had a faint premonition that Quinn's kidnapping this time might be because of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had just signed an agreement with Dalton when something like this happened to him... If he was really kidnapped and suddenly subjected to torture like in hell because of me, then I am truly guilty of a heinous crime, and I cannot even forgive myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mood suddenly became more complicated. I stood up, too anxious to sit down calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, now she is asking me to bring ten million dollars in cash to a town in Ruini and place the money at their designated location, otherwise they will kill Quinn. You quickly contact the company's finance department and have them transfer ten million dollars from the company's account to my account. Let's follow the instructions given by the other party for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten million dollars? In cash? And she's demanding that you place the money at the location she specifies!" Adam exclaimed, his mouth agape. "Madeline, this puts us in a very vulnerable position. If she takes the cash and still doesn't release Quinn, we won't have any options at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane frowned throughout the entire process and calmly said, "Ruini... that place is very close to Mexico, Ms. Mayers. You absolutely cannot go there alone with cash. It's dangerous over there, and you're also pregnant now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know that too, but now Quinn is being controlled by her. If he doesn't do as they say, he is likely to be in grave danger. Anyway, I can never let anything happen to Quinn! If something happens to him, I will never be able to forgive myself for the rest of my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I was speaking, I couldn't help but choke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, we understand how you feel, don't worry, we'll figure it out together! I think we should call the police first! We're not familiar with Norch City, and right now we're in the light while they're in the dark, we can't let them control us like this," Adam said, supporting my shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane also said at this time, "I agree that we should call the police first. Otherwise, we would be too passive. We have no idea who they are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and took out my phone from my pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as I was about to call the police, my phone suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I looked, it was still the local number from Norch City calling, so I quickly answered the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect it</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>B</span><span>efore I even spoke, the hoarse and harsh voice of that woman came through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, did you receive the gift I sent you? I am well aware of your whereabouts, so I hope you don't try any tricks. Follow my instructions exactly. If I find out that you have reported to the police, Quinn might not see the sun tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I trembled all over in shock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the three of us were in the room, I felt as if she had grown an extra pair of eyes on us. She actually knew every move we made!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="728.html">« Prev</a><a href="730.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
