I'll come with you. It's a great opportunity for me to learn about negotiations too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had spent the entire previous night cleaning the suit for Elliott in the dry-cleaning room. Now, I rushed to take it and help Elliott put it on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The neat silver-gray suit highlighted his broad shoulders. The trousers Lily had carefully ironed made his long legs appear even more striking. As always, he paid meticulous attention to his hair, ensuring every strand was in place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was a man of unparalleled attractiveness and physique.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had an innate aura and charisma that mere business tycoons in financial magazines couldn't hold a candle to. A slight touch of grooming would intensify his magnetic presence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wanting to showcase my affection and support, I skillfully tied his tie for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wish to join me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked down at me with a hint of hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew the project he was about to embark on was of utmost importance and involved sensitive commercial secrets. Glory Group and Bryant Group shared a cooperative yet competitive dynamic relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding his concerns, I decided to appeal to his emotional side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After securing his tie in place, I stood on my tiptoes and planted a sweet kiss on his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, how can I stay calm knowing that someone will be mesmerized by your handsomeness? What if the negotiator from the other party is a beautiful woman?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, every man relished the tender affections of a woman.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile immediately graced Elliott's face, and he lovingly pinched my soft cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. The negotiator is a wealthy and powerful man. But I wouldn't mind you coming along to get to know some skills about negotiation better. Perhaps I can even guide you through the intricacies of business."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! Let me change into something more formal then."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott finally agreed, so I quickly turned around and went upstairs. In my closet, I selected a gray suit with black lace that stood itself out from the array of suits.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unique set was designed by a niche brand designer from Italy. It was much cheaper than those famous international brands, but I had fallen in love with the designer's innovative tailoring and distinct style. I had ordered the suit as soon as I laid eyes on it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I swiftly changed into this suit, whose colors complemented Elliott's choice for the day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A quick check in the mirror assured me that my makeup was perfect. I adorned myself with the exquisite four-leaf clover earrings and necklace in green, along with a Vacheron Constantin women's watch. Slipping into my high heels, I took one last look in the mirror and felt satisfied with my polished appearance. Carrying my bag, I descended the stairs with momentum.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The belt of my suit highlighted my slender waist, and the design of the trousers gracefully exposed my ankles, creating an elegant and capable silhouette.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's eyes lit up as he took in my transformed appearance. He gave me an enthusiastic thumbs-up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You look good."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? It's one of my favorite styles."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I confidently spun around, only to be pulled into his arms after my twirl.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gazed at me with a mischievous grin. His eyes were sparkling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I'm the one feeling anxious. How can I prevent others from being captivated by your beauty?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words took me by surprise. Even Elliott, a man of great confidence and stature, had moments of self-doubt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hooked my arm around his neck and smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you can fight for me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was caught off guard by my playful suggestion, unsure how to react. He seemed slightly annoyed and ultimately chose to give me a playful slap on the hip before heading toward the door with his bag.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly chased after him with a smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="351.html">« Prev</a><a href="353.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
