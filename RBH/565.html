I stretched my neck the whole time, capturing every expression, every word, and every move with my camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, I could never have imagined that one day, I would also receive an invitation from the organizers to speak as a guest on stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could I possibly miss such an opportunity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I would be honored. Being personally invited by you is the greatest privilege," I responded without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A week later, dressed in a cream-colored haute couture gown handcrafted by the Feronia renowned designer Anna, adorned with Van Cleef &amp; Arpels earrings and necklace, I confidently and gracefully stepped onto the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was my first time speaking in front of so many renowned entrepreneurs. I had prepared my speech in advance, but once on stage, seeing so many people eagerly watching me from below, I felt that all those fancy words didn't truly capture the essence of my own experiences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I decided to improvise, narrating everything I had done at the Glory Group over the past year, and concluded with a simple summary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spoke with poise and confidence, delivering a genuine and thought-provoking speech. I didn't even realize I had such a strong talent for public speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I concluded my speech within the allotted time, the hall fell silent, then erupted into thunderous applause a few minutes later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled warmly at the audience, thanking the organizers and the guests present, and wrapped up the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I suddenly noticed someone familiar seated in a corner of the audience. He was staring at me intently through the crowd without blinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, he would sit in the front row, right in the middle, but today, he was sitting so inconspicuously in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was somewhat surprised, and just then, Cathy stepped onto the stage. She summarized my speech and opened the floor for questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Glory Group had a certain history in Hoswich, I had only just begun to make a name for myself among the city's entrepreneurs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, during the Q&amp;A session, numerous young entrepreneurs raised their hands, displaying their curiosity about me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, are you currently single?" The first questioner picked up the microphone and asked me a very personal question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could sense his enthusiasm shining through his sparkling eyes, so I gave him a mysterious smile and replied, "That's for me to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, what qualities does a man need to catch your attention?" Another young man stood up. He deliberately straightened his posture, every movement betraying his keen interest in me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled, "Sorry, I'm too busy with my career to consider personal matters. Does anyone have any questions about the business field? Let's discuss together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, the theme would deviate from business, so I had to steer the conversation back on track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After these young entrepreneurs redirected their inquiries, the discussion resumed in earnest. Many of them asked for my business card as the event neared its end, and after some networking, the event finally drew to a close.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="564.html">« Prev</a><a href="566.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
