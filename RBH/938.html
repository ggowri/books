To be honest, I did love you deeply in the past, but after I married you I realized that love and marriage are actually two different things. What's more, my love for you in the past was all based on my imagination, in fact, we didn't really spend much time together and didn't know each other well enough.

I used to marry you by virtue of courage, I did everything for love. But now I'm not that silly little girl, I'm a grown woman, I'm a mom, and I'm my parents' daughter, and every decision I make is about my lifelong happiness and the happiness of the people around me.Quinn is right, even if we stay together, there will still be a lot of cracks that will need to be repaired constantly, and even if they're repaired, it won't be a complete mirror after all.
