Even the agony of losing a child is often shouldered by women alone, as they weep and regret time and again. Yet, men seem to be able to shrug off all responsibility with an unsettling ease.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Often times, women bear far more than men.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, stop your tears. Having a baby for a jerk like Philip isn't worth it. It's a blessing in disguise that you didn't."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paige cry so heartbreakingly, Fiona once again tried to console her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip has changed a lot lately, he hasn't been to my club in a while, and he's dutifully returned to work in his family's business. His parents know he wronged you, and they've asked about you recently. Losing this child has been a great sorrow for them too. Paige, you're wonderful in so many ways, but you're just too headstrong. Nothing in this world is absolute."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paige in such distress, Quinn patted her shoulder, offering words of comfort.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what he becomes, good or bad, I won't forgive him again. I've always been clear about my intolerance for even the slightest betrayal, a fact I've made known to him. Yet, he chose to disregard my words. Now, no matter what he does or how he does it, he can't earn my forgiveness. He will never understand the agony of lying alone on a delivery bed, watching a long abortion needle being inserted into my body. He will never know the pain of lying alone in a hospital bed, writhing in agony, only to see our baby's tiny, purple body curled up. He will never comprehend the price a woman might pay for this, possibly losing her ability to bear children for life. All of this, all because he treated our relationship like a child's play. His parents must be in pain too, their poor parenting led to their son's reckless disregard for feelings. I can only imagine their heartbreak when they opened their door to find a tiny infant left on their doorstep. A nearly full-term baby boy, no less!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's emotions began to escalate, she couldn't help but vent the feelings that had been pent up inside her for so long.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when we all heard that she'd actually left that unborn child on Philip's doorstep, our jaws hit the floor in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige is truly fierce, utterly ruthless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, his mom fainted right there and then, fell seriously ill. His dad was so furious he wanted to kick him out. His dad told me they owe you an apology, asked me to say sorry on their behalf."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What good is an apology now, Miky's already gone. If they hadn't turned a blind eye to everything Philip did, leaving me and my family to bear the brunt, I wouldn't have done this. Madeline, I'm sorry. We were all so happy, but every time I see Lucas, I can't help but relive it all, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was talking and talking until she was nearly sobbing herself into oblivion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her in such distress, Fiona and I immediately enveloped her in a hug. Tears welled up in our eyes and in an instant, the three of us were sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="752.html">« Prev</a><a href="754.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
