His gaze was sincere, and he didn't seem to be lying. I couldn't tell if he had feelings for Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My somewhat tightened heart suddenly relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing. You have been very kind to me recently. I'm not quite used to your change," I said honestly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't treat you better, I'm afraid you will be attracted by another young man one day," Elliott smiled. Then, he said, "Don't post your photos with pretty guys on Instagram. You are married, so you should keep a distance from other men."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that he was displeased because I was close to other men.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder he came to the set openly and came on vacation in Louis City to accompany me. Could it be that Elliott, the president of the Bryant Group, had a sense of crisis?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was incredible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those men are just my partners, and I posted these photos for promotion. Don't overthink it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suppressed the joy in my heart and pretended to be serious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott did not respond to me but asked, "How long will you stay in Louis City?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It will take another month at the earliest before coming back. The current filming has been as advanced as possible," I said in a stern voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I know."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was supportive of my work and didn't say anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he said, "Go to bed early at night. I will take you to climb the mountain tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" I was stunned. "Which mountain? Why do you suddenly want to climb a mountain?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Autumn is suitable for hiking. There is a famous mountain called Flora Mountain in Louis City. We can go hiking. I plan to set off from home at 6 a.m. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had always been like this. He did everything with a clear plan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I have work tomorrow. This is a bit sudden."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a little embarrassed for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put off your work for a while. It's rare for me to take a vacation. I want you to go with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone was firm, with his usual dominance, and I couldn't refuse him at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never been out with Elliott, which was something I dreamed of writing in my diary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget it. Just take it as a chance to fulfill my long-cherished wish that had not been realized in my previous life. With this in mind, I nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meal, Elliott took the initiative to wash dishes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never done housework before, so his movements looked clumsy. When he was washing dishes, he accidentally broke a plate, which made me laugh out loud.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I had to admit that I felt unprecedented happiness from this simple and daily life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I left Hoswich and ignored Giselle and everything in the past. The strange atmosphere between us seemed to have dissipated. I didn't say anything to spoil the fun, and he doted on me just right. Everything between us became very relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of ease was something I had always dreamed of.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Elliott and I took a shower, then nestled on the sofa together and watched a movie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was half-leaning on the sofa, and I rested my head on his lap. Afraid that I would be cold, he thoughtfully covered me with a thin blanket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched the movie and fell asleep without realizing it. When I was half awake, I felt Elliott picking me up and carrying me up the stairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he gently placed me on the soft bed. I was about to turn over and continue to sleep when I felt him kiss me gently. His cold lips caressed my lips gently like feathers...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="206.html">« Prev</a><a href="208.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
