"No, it's just that I'm used to eating $4 box meals. Suddenly eating this, I really don't know where to start."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott laughed immediately, "No wonder you've lost weight, turns out you haven't been eating well. From now on, every day at noon, I will have the chef from the Royal Taste prepare your favorite dishes and deliver them to you, so you can properly replenish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so obviously good, it really made me feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head quickly. "No need for that, I'm not that delicate. Cheap boxed meals are fine. Besides, I came to Louis City not to enjoy myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's rare to hear these words from your mouth. It seems like you have really grown up now," Elliott said, patting my head like an older brother and smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said this, I couldn't help but recall that I used to be quite extravagant and wasteful in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Probably because I was spoiled by my parents since I was young, I never had a concept of money. In the past, I would order whatever I wanted to eat without considering the cost, and if I couldn't finish it, I would just waste it. I never calculated the expenses, and I also had a tendency to be picky, always wanting the best of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, being independent and managing a project on my own, I realize that there were many areas where savings could be made, and a lot of money that didn't need to be spent extravagantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially after I saw the financial report Katrina gave me and realized that Glory Group had lost a large sum of money due to extravagance and waste, I told myself that I must cut costs and increase revenue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wasn't young either, you just kept looking at me with an old perspective," I said discontentedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I dare not look at you with the same old eyes anymore," Elliott said, chewing slowly and sighing. "Nowadays, you are always surrounded by young male actors, it's truly different from before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his words, there was clearly a hint of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head and couldn't help but glance at him, teasingly saying, "Elliott, are you jealous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, just smiled and didn't say much. He simply lowered his head, picked up a piece of beef, and put it in my lunch box. He said softly, "Have a meal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a person who indeed spoke very little, and moreover, he did not like to express his thoughts and opinions. Sometimes, even if he did speak, it would only be to touch upon the subject and he would not be willing to say much more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to his aloofness in the past, he now talks a lot more in front of me. However, despite that, I still feel an indescribable sense of distance between him and me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He came to see me so suddenly, to visit me, but he didn't say the reason, leaving me clueless about what he really wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was not as relaxed and contented as eating cheap boxed meals when faced with such high-end ingredients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found that my originally calm heart, because of his sudden visit, began to become unsettled again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We silently finished our meal, and I thought that after the meal, he would leave, so I asked, "Is there something you came to Louis City for? When do you plan to leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what surprised me completely was that Elliott said, "I took a few days off and came here specifically to accompany you. If you're done eating, I'll take you to a place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah? But I had something to do in the afternoon," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he take a special vacation to accompany me?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="199.html">« Prev</a><a href="201.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
