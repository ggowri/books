I meant no harm. I had to ensure the safety of my friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I calmly expressed my thoughts over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! Your demands were too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Delin complained, she still didn't want to lose the ten million dollars in cash she was about to receive. Sure enough, as I had expected, she eventually compromised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane and I exchanged a glance simultaneously, nodded, and then we separately jumped out of the car and took out five suitcases from the back seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We had just taken out these suitcases when we immediately heard a sound coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far ahead of where we were, there was an abandoned warehouse. Instinctively, we looked toward the source of the sound and saw two people dragging a barely conscious man, appearing in our line of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the middle was obviously tormented, as he seemed to have no strength even to walk. He hung his head down, relying entirely on the two people beside him to drag him along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, my heart tightened immediately, and I shouted loudly in their direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, Delin called me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have seen him already. Now, immediately bring out the other five suitcases and hand them all over to my subordinates! Hurry up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Delin was very cunning. She was clearly supposed to be in that white van, but she pretended that she wasn't present and only wanted to communicate with me through phone calls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them dragged the man in the middle and walked over step by step. They stopped at a distance of 65 feet away from me and didn't take another step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I can now hand over all this money to you, but the condition is that you make them bring Quinn to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I continued talking to her on the phone about the terms, because I knew better than anyone that if I were completely under her control, once they got the money, they wouldn't let go of Quinn's words, and we would be in a passive situation. Although Dehan had already secretly arranged everything, for safety reasons, I had to be extremely cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane and I took down all ten suitcases we brought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened one of the suitcases, took a photo of the box full of cash, and sent it to Delin's phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought they would really release Quinn after they got the money, but what I didn't expect was that, at that moment, several people suddenly got off the white van.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any warning, these people rushed toward us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Sure enough, they actually wanted to come and rob us!" Jane exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She did not run away, but quickly stood in front of me, tightly protecting me, and then whispered quickly, "Ms. Mayers, I will deal with them, you quickly get in the car and go! Hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could hesitate, she had already quickly opened the car door and without any hesitation, she directly pushed me into the car!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat down on the car seat, and at that moment, Jane had already quickly closed the car door and immediately started fighting with the people rushing toward us!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="738.html">« Prev</a><a href="740.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
