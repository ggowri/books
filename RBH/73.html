This is the first time a woman who has been rumored to be involved with Elliott has come to me specifically to clarify herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" I raised an eyebrow. Immediately, I set down the documents in my hand. "Ms. Hart, aren't you often seen together with my husband? How do you manage to keep your distance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia felt a bit embarrassed by what I said. She instinctively averted her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, Mr. Bryant... did treat me differently than other women. He also never refused to appear with me in public. But in reality, he still adhered to his principles in private. Please believe me in this regard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Elliott adhere to the principles?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately felt fresher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Giselle appeared, Elliott had already had more than ten or twenty rumored partners. And Sylvia was also one of his rumored partners whom he had been with for a relatively long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott often had rumors with other women, would he abide by principles? Moreover, Elliott never touched me. If he had never slept with other women outside... how could that be possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt like I was listening to a joke. Her words were not very believable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Elliott specifically ask you to come over and explain to me today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Sylvia and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, Sylvia shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not like that. I really want to play the leading role in Do Not Love. So, I want to have an honest conversation with you. Actually, I was with Mr. Bryant hoping that he could invest in this play. But... I didn't expect that the rights to this play have been bought by Glory Group now. I am a loyal fan of Do Not Love. I have read the book at least 10 times because I have always wanted to play the female lead in this play. I really hope you can give me this opportunity. If you can give me this chance, I can assure you that I will definitely separate myself from Mr. Bryant in the future. Please believe me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turns out that Sylvia was actually a loyal fan of Do Not Love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder, in the previous life, she didn't have much acting skills, but her performance in this drama was surprisingly excellent. She portrayed the entire life of the female protagonist very realistically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous life, she quickly rose to fame in the film and television industry with this drama. She instantly went from a third-tier celebrity to an A-list star. Afterward, she secured numerous endorsements in one go. Moreover, she also received several influential awards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her character was not very good, her taste in selecting works was actually quite good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, she was just a rumor for Elliott. Even if she were to come to me now, humbling herself and lowering her status, I would never give her the role of the female lead in this play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see. No wonder my husband personally went to negotiate for such a small script. Ms. Hart, your charm is indeed impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I mocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever I think about that night, when Elliott personally went to negotiate with the copyright holder for this script, I inexplicably feel a slight uneasiness in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia became even more embarrassed by what I said. She awkwardly chuckled and said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant was indeed a good person. He was generous and righteous. However, I didn't really have any relationship with him. Moreover, after I was kicked out by you that day, Mr. Bryant also had his assistant tell me that I don't need to contact him anymore. Ms. Mayers, I believe you bought this play with the intention of doing it well. If you are willing to let me be the leading actress, not only am I willing to lower my salary, but I will also spare no effort in promoting it in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia was quite obsessed with this script. In order to get the role, she didn't hesitate to reveal more inside information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just found out that after I kicked Sylvia out that day, Elliott didn't blame me. Instead, he even cut off contact with Sylvia from then on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he do this for me?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="72.html">« Prev</a><a href="74.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
