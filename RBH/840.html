She exuded an air of elegance and opulence. Even her hair seemed freshly permed into tight curls, making her head appear even larger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing me, she too, was taken aback. Then, she gave me a once-over from head to toe, still maintaining her haughty demeanor as she said, "Oh, it's you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that's me." I instinctively straightened up, meeting her gaze, and responded with a hint of nonchalance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I made an extra effort to dress up today for my meeting with Quinn's parents. I wore a pale blue button-up shirt on top, paired with a white skirt that fell just above my ankles. To complete the look, I slipped into a pair of white stiletto heels.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm already tall, and with heels on, I'm even taller. So, when I stand in front of Laura, she has to look up at me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dining here too? Don't tell me you knew Elliott was hosting some VIPs here and you deliberately tagged along?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To assert her dominance, she deliberately placed her hands on her hips and asked me in a brash manner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled, "Me, following him? Laura, do you still think I'm the same person from years ago? Please, I lost interest in your son a long time ago!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've long since grown to despise Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just that, every time she shows up, I find myself disliking her even more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shot her a hard look, and with the principle of not letting her ruin my mood tonight, I bypassed her and headed straight for the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, she actually caught up with me. "Madeline," she spat, "if you're truly over my son, then stay the hell away from him! Don't you dare step foot in Serenity Villa again! You're not worthy of being there!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She actually knew I'd been back to Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems she has quite a few spies around Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that being said, she should know better than anyone why I'm still hanging around Elliott, why I've returned to Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew damn well that I was here to help her son, not to rekindle things with Elliott. But instead of being grateful, she had the audacity to mock me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was speechless. I shot her a glare, striding forward, my voice laced with anger. "Really? Are you sure about that? Right now, it's your son who has a blood clot in his brain causing amnesia, and he needs my cooperation for his treatment! Laura, I don't expect gratitude from you, but you'd better not provoke me right now. Because if I were to tell Elliott that we've been divorced for a while, and that causes the blood clot in his brain to burst, don't blame me for the consequences!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished speaking, I slapped the wall, causing Laura to shudder from head to toe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm no longer the pushover she could bully at will.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glared at her fiercely, her whole body trembling, "Madeline, what... what are you planning to do!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want trouble, but you'd best not cross me. Or you'll regret it." I said, staring her down, my tone fierce and unyielding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's eyes bulged in terror, her body trembling uncontrollably. I let out a cold chuckle, then turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I retreated back to my room, immersing myself once again in the elders' chatter.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="839.html">« Prev</a><a href="841.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
