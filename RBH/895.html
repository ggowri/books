Unable to resist, he leaned in, pressing a deep kiss to my forehead. Only then did he turn, leading the others out of the infirmary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott shut the door to the infirmary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her hands tucked into her pockets, Lisa stood before me, a peculiar smile playing on her lips. She stared at me, her eyes squinted in a way that made her look uncannily like a cunning fox.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of gaze, it's unsettling. I can't quite put my finger on why.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fox, perhaps it's high time we had a chat, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat up, looking at her as I spoke calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, what exactly do you want to discuss with me? We... we don't seem to have much in common, aside from our looks."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa skillfully steered the conversation elsewhere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? I'd say there's quite a connection between Ms. Fox and me, you seem to pop up wherever I go. If my memory serves me right, our first encounter was at that resort hotel in Onastin, remember?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vacation hotel? Which one? I don't recall ever seeing Ms. Mayers in Onastin, at least not to my memory."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa was still playing the innocent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some things don't need to be spelled out. We're all smart here, tell me, Ms. Fox, what's your real game? Is it for Elliott? Or is it for me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to keep going around in circles with her, so I went straight to the point.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa deliberately glanced outside, then took a couple of steps towards me. She sat down in front of me, whispering:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, I'm still not getting your point. I came to Hoswich City because I was drawn to the allure of the big city life. I just want to find my footing here in Hoswich. As for you, I'm really not interested--"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Lisa still had the audacity to try and deceive me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave her a cool, detached smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Then I'd like to know, aren't you the woman who frequently visits the orphanage to see Giselle? From the surveillance footage the director showed me, wasn't that you I saw?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept my gaze locked on her facial expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, the moment I mentioned Giselle, her gaze shifted rapidly. In that instant, a powerful instinct compelled her to blurt out:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, have you been snooping around on me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sudden agitation was telling enough; there must be a significant connection between her and Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, how could she possibly go to see Giselle's child? And there's no way she'd drop her act and get so worked up the moment I mention Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't been snooping on you. It's just that, you keep coming around me, over and over again. I have to figure out what you're up to, don't I?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at her, not wanting to miss the slightest shift in her emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what I hadn't anticipated was that this woman was even more adept at deception than I had imagined.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was clearly emotional just a moment ago, but instantly, she simply offered a faint smile:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you're talking about Jali Welfare Home? Yeah, I've made a few donations there. Those orphans, they tug at your heartstrings, don't they? But Giselle's kid? Can't say I know them."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's definitely playing dumb about this!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="894.html">« Prev</a><a href="896.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
