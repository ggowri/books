It took a moment for Laura to regain her composure, her longing for a grandson evident. Reluctantly, she asked, "But...?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't value your son's life, then by all means, continue talking!" I snapped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura cast a glance at Elliott, finally shutting her mouth obediently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your mom's talking nonsense. How could I possibly have had a child? Aren't you the one who knows best whether I've been pregnant or not?" I said to Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, did you just say you saw Madeline's parents holding a kid?" Elliott asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I must've misread the situation. They were just carrying a basket, probably filled with vegetables or something. It was a misunderstanding on my part," Laura hastily clarified.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you were just dining with Madeline's folks, huh?" Elliott questioned, catching on quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was stuck in an awkward predicament, unable to spill the beans. All he could do was shrug helplessly, choosing silence over words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott spat out in anger, "So you've been turning me down time and again to meet your parents, but you've been having secret dinners with Quinn? Madeline, have you stopped liking me a long time ago?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice grew increasingly deep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation had escalated to this point, there was no use in hiding anymore. I met his gaze, my voice steady yet soft, "Elliott, if it bothers you, we can divorce, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was merely testing the waters, curious to see how he would react to my words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had the words left my mouth than Elliott's face began to contort, his lips turning a ghostly white. Before anyone could react, he had already collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He passed out again?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We all got a hell of a scare, but thank God for Quinn's quick reflexes, he managed to catch him in time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what's up with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Laura threw herself onto Elliott, sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is crying going to help now? Call an ambulance, quick!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly whipped out my phone, dialing the emergency number without a second's delay.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why did you provoke him? If anything happens to Elliott, you..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was gearing up to berate me again, but my icy stare stopped her in her tracks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I mentioned divorce, her son passed out. Clearly, her son's life is now in my hands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I reckon she's got the picture by now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ambulance arrived swiftly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I swiftly worked in tandem with the doctors and nurses to get Elliott onto the vehicle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside Bryant Hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After examining Elliott, Jack called me into his office. He looked at me and said, "He's fainted again. The blood clot has grown larger, putting more pressure on a wider range of nerves..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="844.html">« Prev</a><a href="846.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
