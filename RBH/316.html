You seem really frightened."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just about to leave the company to find you when I unexpectedly ran into Jade on the way. I got scared and accidentally dropped some files. She helped me pick them up. I'm really afraid now. And she saw the contents of these files, so she must know that I'm investigating her." Katrina said in one breath.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, as long as we have enough evidence, I can convene a shareholders' meeting immediately and kick her out of Glory Group. Don't worry." I quickly reassured Katrina.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I found the evidence, and it's shocking. Take a look at these files. They contain evidence of her embezzling company funds under the guise of investments over the past few years. At the time, she promoted these projects vigorously, but many of them ended in failure, leaving the invested money gone to waste. Because it's normal for projects to have profits and losses, and at that time, Austin trusted her a lot, so I didn't pay much attention to these losses. Now that I've looked into it, I've found that these projects all have issues." Katrina said, handing me the files.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I looked through the files, I became increasingly alarmed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These projects were all investments made by Glory Group over the years. Some were worth millions of dollars, while others were worth tens of millions. But without exception, these projects all failed for various reasons, leaving behind a trail of bad debts. And the embezzled funds were withdrawn from the accounts under various pretexts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was in charge of these projects. Many of the files had her signature on them, enough to prove how much my father trusted her over the years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The total amount of these projects amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. But there were only a few projects that actually turned a profit, and most of them ended up losing money.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I looked through these files, my expression grew increasingly grim. I couldn't help but ask Katrina, "Hasn't my father suspected anything over the past few years?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Katrina shook her head. "Austin trusted Jade a lot and gave her full control. Our finance department only handles the inflow and outflow of funds. As long as the procedures were reasonable, we didn't delve into the details. If it weren't for your investigation this time, these accounts would have already been sealed away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These projects were all relatively promising. If they had been properly managed, they would have made some profit. It seems that she lined her own pockets with this money." I said grimly. I couldn't help but feel that she was like a parasite, exploiting my father's trust to greedily devour everything at Glory Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized how foolish I had been to trust Jade so much in the past. It seemed that both my father and I were too kind-hearted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Katrina handed over all the evidence to me. With this evidence in hand, I immediately informed several shareholders. I planned to convene an emergency meeting of shareholders overnight to expose this evidence to the public.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making all the phone calls to the shareholders, Katrina and I left Lantern Cafe together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was around five o'clock in the afternoon by then. I told Katrina not to return to the office and to go home early to pick up her daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I had scheduled an emergency meeting with the shareholders at six thirty in the evening, I planned to drive directly to Glory Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what I didn't expect was that just as I was about to leave for the office, my phone suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up the phone and saw that it was Jade calling. So, I answered the call and asked calmly, "What's up? Is something wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, tell me the truth. Are you investigating the projects I did before?" Jade didn't even bother with fake politeness anymore. She shouted at me over the phone, sounding extremely frustrated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What you did before is your own business. If you don't want people to know, don't do it," I replied calmly.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="315.html">« Prev</a><a href="317.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
