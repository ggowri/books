My villa had just been decorated by Philip. This community has just been built, and no one lives next to me. This is strange. I'll go back and ask Philip," Paige muttered in confusion. By this time, I had already driven the car downstairs of her villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip is at home now. Why didn't you let him accompany you to do the prenatal check-up?" I asked in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He went on a business trip yesterday and got home very late. I couldn't bear to wake him up so early. Madeline, I will go back and ask him first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was probably alert, so she got out of the car and walked into the villa after she finished speaking absentmindedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched her enter the villa, then turned around and drove out of the path. Just as I was about to go to the Glory Group, my phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I answered the phone, "Hello, who is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you free right now? I want to talk to you." Sylvia's sound was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, where're you? I'll go there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I originally planned to talk with Sylvia, but I didn't expect that she would find me first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's meet at Lantern Cafe. I'll be there in ten minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, fifteen minutes later, I arrived downstairs at Lantern Cafe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I arrived at the coffee shop, Sylvia was waiting in the booth in the corner of the cafe. Perhaps because it was a weekday morning, the cafe was very empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked over, sat across from her, and asked her straight to the point, "What do you want from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you reconcile with Elliott? Why was your husband taken away from you so quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took off her sunglasses and looked at me inquiringly. Her charming eyes showed malicious pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I could understand her mood at this time. As I was her love rival, she would feel happy if I suddenly lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and shrugged helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing I can do. The girl he loves appears and is pregnant, so I have no choice but to admit defeat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That woman is his ideal lover?" Sylvia looked contemptuous. Then, she suddenly leaned over and said, "Do you need me to help you? I can make her uncomfortable for a few days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia had disappeared for a while. With Giselle around, I suddenly found that Sylvia didn't annoy me as much as she did at first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you going to do? Tell me," I asked and pretended to be interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled mysteriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is pregnant now. Isn't now the perfect time for me to seduce Elliott? Besides, Elliott even took the initiative to call me last night. It means that he doesn't care about her that much. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's your business if you want to deal with her. Why are you telling me this?" I looked at her and asked nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared into my eyes and smiled even more weirdly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, we know each other well enough. You don't have to pretend in front of me. I came to you just to tell you that I can help you deal with that woman. However, I hope you can let me play a role in your next drama. I'm not greedy. I just want to act the supporting role."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out Sylvia came to negotiate with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I preferred talking straight to the point.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="557.html">« Prev</a><a href="559.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
