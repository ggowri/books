I'll check it on the computer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Fiona sat before her computer and started searching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hospital's internal systems are connected to the Internet, so Fiona found Giselle's cases soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The report showed the fetus in Giselle's belly was almost five months old. However, there was a page indicating that her fetus had chromosomal abnormalities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this page, Fiona immediately exclaimed,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God! Her child may have Down's syndrome. Theoretically, she should terminate the pregnancy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what Fiona said, I hurriedly stepped forward. Then, I saw one of the report sheets was for Down's syndrome screening, which indicated that one of the chromosomes was high risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I knew very little about pregnancy before, so I had no idea about what Down's syndrome meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona searched for some pictures and information at once. Then, pointing at the children in the pictures, she told me what children with Down's syndrome looked like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help being surprised after seeing those children with almost the same face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do these children like this develop normally?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not. That is why pregnant women should undergo prenatal screening for Down's syndrome. If a certain screening test is high-risk like hers, further non-invasive detection or amniocentesis is necessary to determine the final result. If the result shows that the screening test is still high-risk, the doctor will definitely remind the pregnant woman to stop the pregnancy. You said that she drank even though she knew she was pregnant. Is she crazy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona held her heart and shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Fiona's words, I immediately understood what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it possible that she knew there was something wrong with the child, so she kicked the can down the road? Anyway, the child will finally be miscarried."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help thinking about it in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking up at me, Fiona shrugged helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder she would rather come to this hospital for examination than that at Bryant Hospital. Maybe she is worried that she will have no chance to marry Elliott if the Bryant family finds out about this examination report."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's analysis did make some sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, I involuntarily thought that Laura looked so pious and careful while facing Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura longed for a grandson or granddaughter. I wonder how she could react once she knew the child probably had a congenital disease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, are her other report results normal? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help asking hurriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona refreshed the page. However, all the content we just saw disappeared from the system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that there is an unusual relationship between Doctor Louis and Giselle. He actually deleted all her problematic reports from the system. If we hadn't acted quickly, we might not have seen that one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona exclaimed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked forward. Sure enough, the remaining relevant information about Giselle's cases on the system only showed the results of routine blood tests and routine urine tests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor Louis."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, I was reminded that Giselle's mother was from the Louis family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe Doctor Louis and Giselle's mother are related.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I recalled that Cormac had forced Elliott and me to undergo an examination before. Doctor Louis examined us at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he stole Elliott's samples so that Giselle could successfully get pregnant through a test-tube baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they would never imagine that there would be something wrong with the child they got so hard.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="448.html">« Prev</a><a href="450.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
