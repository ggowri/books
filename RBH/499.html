Seeing me walking in alone, he asked me curiously, "Ms. Mayers, are you okay? Is the man just now your friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head and said angrily, "No, he's not in his right mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to my words, Dalton was shocked. However, he didn't say much and just smiled. Then, he cast his gaze on the stage again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, I saw Audrey, an actor from my company, was invited to the stage by the host. She was awarded the year's Best New Talent Award.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was her first time to win an award in the film and television industry, her performance was surprising. Wearing a simple white tube top dress and a simple bun, Audrey looked like a rose that had just bloomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her calm speech and decent performance, I couldn't help but smile. I believed that my investment in her was correct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I was glad for her, Elliott returned to his seat and sat down next to me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I felt a little heavy in my heart. In order to divert my attention, I talked to Dalton again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't say anything. Throughout the second half of the ceremony, he sat there quietly, like a thousand-year-old iceberg, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, I had been talking to Dalton all the time. Yet, the massive pressure from the right side still made the right side of my body feel stiff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the ceremony came to an end, I couldn't wait to stand up and leave quickly from the other side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I walked out of the venue, Audrey suddenly called and stopped me. She came forward, lowered her head, and said, "Ms. Mayers, I have never found a suitable opportunity to thank you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to act in Do Not Love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Audrey stood in front of me and smiled sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I hired her as an actor in Glory Group, I had never been too close to her. I didn't want to put pressure on her. On the other hand, I also wanted to see if she could rely on her talents to perform in that complex acting field and stand firm in the circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, to her, I was her boss behind the scenes. She had always kept a distance from me and rarely came to me to say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time she expressed her gratitude to me in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and patted her shoulder, then said gladfully, "You're welcome. There will be many more opportunities like this in the future. I hope you will continue to work hard and perform well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, thanks for the opportunity again. Don't worry, I will definitely continue to work hard!" Audrey nodded and expressed her gratitude to me again. From her bright and dazzling eyes, I could feel that she was really grateful to me from the bottom of her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only if a person knew how to be grateful could she go further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I believed she had a promising future, but I didn't say much. After chatting with her for a few while, I turned and walked toward the entrance of the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the venue, the wind was biting cold. I instinctively wrapped my shawl tightly around myself. Just as I was about to get into the car, someone suddenly called my name from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That sharp voice sounded so familiar that I subconsciously stopped and turned to look over.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="498.html">« Prev</a><a href="500.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
