Fiona was positioned in one corner, while in the center of the room, a pregnant Giselle was wagging her finger and berating Sylvia, who was sitting on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the sofa, Elliott was drunk and unconscious, slumped over on Sylvia's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia, with her cascading waves of hair, donned a revealing off-the-shoulder black dress, her diamond tassel earrings gleaming. She still maintained her seductive appearance from before, with heavy makeup, forming a sharp contrast with Giselle, who was dressed in pajamas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to pregnancy, Giselle, who used to have a slender figure, now appeared clumsy and swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had probably rushed over from home when Sean mentioned it. So, she wore no makeup, and a headband holding her hair, resembling an ordinary housewife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she hadn't expected Elliott to be sitting with such an alluring woman, and even if she saw Giselle, there was no sign of avoiding suspicion from the other party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The argument between the two reverberated through the phone, and I listened with relish. "Move aside, you bitch! Who do you think you are? Elliott is my husband, get out of here now!" Giselle said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I? Show me your marriage certificate! I know he had a wife before, but she's Madeline, not you! Who are you?" Sylvia retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm carrying Elliott's child! If you don't move, I won't let you off!" Giselle threatened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott specifically invited me tonight. I won't move. Since you're pregnant, you shouldn't be running around, especially not in a bar. It's bad for the baby!" Sylvia replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you bitch! I'll make you regret this!" Giselle snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia was never a good person, and she wouldn't miss the chance to regain Elliott's favor in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she probably didn't know much about Giselle, nor would she believe her words without proof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly provoked, Giselle couldn't bear it anymore. Seeing Sylvia sitting so provocatively next to Elliott, with Elliott drunk and slumped on her shoulder, Giselle snapped and grabbed Sylvia's long hair!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screams of the women, accompanied by the sound of a bottle smashing on the ground, echoed through the VIP room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis tried to intervene, but the two women were already grappling with each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room descended into chaos in an instant, and soon, Giselle's blood-curdling screams came through the video call. Hearing that voice, I couldn't help but feel a chill down my spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go! My stomach hurts! I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding!" Giselle cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sylvia, let go! She's really bleeding! She's pregnant, and if anything happens to her, you'll be responsible. Sylvia, don't act rashly!" Alexis pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Giselle bleeding, Alexis's voice rang out in the VIP room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia finally realized the seriousness of the situation and let go of Giselle's hair. At this moment, Fiona, being a doctor, sensed trouble and quickly said to the phone, "I'll go check on the situation. It'll be disastrous if something happens! I'll hang up now; call you later if there's any news!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After briefing me, Fiona promptly ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, my world returned to silence, but the chaotic scene from moments ago continued to replay in my mind.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="549.html">« Prev</a><a href="551.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
