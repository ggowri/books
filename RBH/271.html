As soon as I entered, I spotted a black devil's dress, which was perfect for occasions like Halloween.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I bought the dress right away and also picked up a devil mask. Then, I headed straight to Quinn's club in Louis City.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's club was still in its soft opening phase, but even so, it was already bustling with activity. The interior d&eacute;cor was even more lavish than that of the Hoswich club.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I parked the car, Quinn dashed out, dressed like a millennium-old vampire, with his face painted a ghastly white. Honestly, he startled me at first glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you dress up like this?" I thumped his chest in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Halloween. I gotta be a little creative. How's my vampire look?" He winked, holding a juice bag made to look like blood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, his charmingly wicked appearance fit the bill quite well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks good," I chuckled, playing along.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you still wearing your own clothes? Did you bring your costume? Let's get you changed." Quinn hurriedly urged me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did. Find me a fitting room, and I'll change," I replied promptly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Quinn dragged me to the upstairs fitting room. Once inside, I quickly changed into the mini black dress, adorned my head with two small red horns, and put on the devil mask before stepping out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black dress was one with straps and a puffy bottom that ended just above my knees. Its unique design accentuated my charming legs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's eyes lit up at the sight of me, and then he grinned mischievously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, you're quite wicked. Playing the little devil, huh?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gotta embrace the darkness for Halloween, right? Let's go." I winked back, smiling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn offered his arm, indicating for me to link mine with his. Without hesitation, I did so, and together we set off for the costume party.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought this party would be just a small gathering, but as soon as the doors of the venue opened, the lively and eerie scene inside stunned me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire venue was decked out in Halloween decorations, with pumpkin lanterns, spider webs, and skulls adorning the walls and ceilings. The men and women inside were already in a frenzy, dressed as ghosts, angels, or zombies, roaming the venue freely. The assortment of drinks and eerie music created a strangely frenetic atmosphere, engulfing everyone in a wild mood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time I celebrated Halloween was back in college. Now, experiencing this atmosphere again after so many years, I suddenly felt a lot more relaxed.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="270.html">« Prev</a><a href="272.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
