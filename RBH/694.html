I didn't expect time to pass so quickly, and in the blink of an eye, he has already returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wearing a black bomber jacket, a black duckbill cap on his head, and carrying a shoulder bag in his hand, appearing very low-key. However, he still exuded a strong presence, evoking a hint of awe from deep within people's hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, have you come back from Norch City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus, I felt an indescribable sense of familiarity. I immediately stood up and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, the herbal acquisition this time went smoothly, so I came back a few days early. Madeline, I specifically picked some fresh gastrodin and ganoderma from Norch City, and you can use them as supplements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a big smile, Marcus took out two packages of gastrodin and ganoderma wrapped in plastic wrap from his bag and handed them to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just handed it over, and I immediately smelled the fragrance of ganoderma. Judging from the color and scent of this ganoderma, as well as the full form of gastrodin, these herbs must be of high quality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are too kind. These things must be expensive, right? Thank you, Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a glance and quickly said gratefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I got pregnant until now, he always made me some recipes based on my physical condition, and sometimes he even specially prepared some ingredients to nourish my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was also a major reason why I was so relaxed during my pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't mention it. These things are not expensive, just very fresh. We don't have them at all here. They are all wild and were painstakingly dug up by the local mountain people. They have extremely high nutritional value. After you take them back, follow the recipe I sent you and stew them into soup. Be careful with storage, don't waste them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus still had a smile on his face as he softly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the success of the previous anti-flu capsule, his pharmaceutical brand also took this opportunity to enter the domestic market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew it. Marcus, how are the experimental results of those drugs you mentioned last time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I accepted them all. Then, I asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the success of the anti-flu capsule, Marcus could have taken this opportunity to develop several more drugs and seize the market. However, his standards were high, and he was unwilling to create drugs similar to those already available on the market. </span><span>Instead, he wanted to research and develop several new drugs based on ancient prescriptions recorded in old books.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doing so means that the cost of trial and error is high, and it takes a lot of time and effort. Once the research and development is unsuccessful or the market feedback is not good, all the invested money will go down the drain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus insisted on doing it. He said that he started the pharmaceutical company not to make money or gain high profits, but because he felt it was a pity that many truly effective prescriptions were not researched for certain reasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only wanted to have the opportunity to develop more truly effective drugs while he was alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The experimental results were quite good. It has been successful in animals. Now I have started recruiting volunteers for clinical trials. If the trials are successful, we can apply for production. This time, I bought a lot of scarce herbs in Norch City. Although the cost was high, I think it is worth it as long as the medicine is effective."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="693.html">« Prev</a><a href="695.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
